Wearing a knee-length dress and a white cardigan, Haggard crossed the street. Leaning toward a passenger-side window, Haggard\u2019s shoulder-length hair grazed the neckline of the dress. Minutes later, the person in the vehicle struck out with a knife, stabbing Haggard in the neck. Haggard stumbled, bleeding in the street and later dying at a hospital in the Central California city of Fresno. LGBT activists say Haggard\u2019s brutal killing was the 11th so far this year of a transgender woman \u2014 and the second in just three days. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But as far as the Fresno Police Department is concerned, the 66-year-old victim is male \u2014 not female. The case has highlighted the challenges of investigating violent crimes against transgender people, who, in the early stages of transitioning, might keep their identities secret from even the closest people in their lives. They live in fear of being themselves, advocates say. And when they are victimized, law enforcement is often slow to acknowledge their true identities, leaving potential avenues of investigation untouched and also making it more difficult to track violence against transgender people. \u201cWe have a tremendous problem of under-reporting of hate crimes against trans people \u2014 and all hate crimes,\u201d said David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group. _[Girl Scouts choose transgender girls over $100,000 donation]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Fresno Police Department said it is investigating all leads to determine who committed the horrific crime, but there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the victim was transgender or that Haggard was killed for that reason. \u201cWe have no information that this victim identified as transgender,\u201d Lt. Joe Gomez, a spokesman for the Fresno Police Department, told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd in fact, the information that we do have from people he lived with is that he did not.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not pertinent in the crime,\u201d Gomez added. Furthermore, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer referred to the victim repeatedly as \u201cMr. Haggard\u201d in a press conference Saturday \u2014 a decision that has infuriated activists rallying to bring attention to the killing. \u201cShe was out \u2018test-driving\u2019 her female attire in the early morning, where she could be herself and not be bothered; I am convinced of that,\u201d said Karen Adell Scot, founder of TransCare, which provides aid to people transitioning in the Fresno area. \u201cShe was newly transitioning.\u201d _[8 critical facts about the state of transgender America\u200b]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The last time Jeff Haggard saw his cousin, it was about a year and a half ago, in a brief, chance meeting. He had no idea that his cousin might have been transitioning. \u201cHe seemed like the Kenton I\u2019ve always known since I was a kid,\u201d Jeff Haggard said. His cousin was always \u201ckind of a loner,\u201d who never married and had no children, Jeff Haggard said, noting that when he first read about his cousin\u2019s killing, it was in the local news. Gerald Haggard, Kenton Haggard\u2019s brother, confirmed to The Post that his only sibling had been killed. Kenton Haggard worked as a security guard for years until he retired recently \u2014 no longer able to keep up with the physical demands of the job, Gerald Haggard told The Post. A few months ago, neighbors at the apartment complex where Kenton Haggard lived called his brother, who lives about an hour away, to report that Kenton Haggard was \u201ccross-dressing and walking down the street,\u201d Gerald Haggard said. \u201cThese incidents were all in the day.\u201d \u201cI knew that he was cross-dressing,\u201d Gerald Haggard told The Post. \u201cWe never had a conversation about transgender or changing.\u201d In fact, they spoke last week, hours before Kenton Haggard was killed. But Gerald Haggard said the conversation centered on daily life and the subject of transitioning never came up. \u201cI was concerned for my brother, but for his whole situation as far as his financial health, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe least of my concerns had to do with the new cross-dressing. The new cross-dressing was not high on my list of worries or concerns.\u201d He added: \u201cIf he wanted to voluntarily talk about it, then that would have been fine. If he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, then it was his freedom to do what he wanted.\u201d _[Transgender in Maine: What life looks like for women who transitioned over age 60]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The complexities of this case have also divided LGBT advocates, who express varying degrees of wariness about assuming a person\u2019s gender identity \u2014 one way or another. According to LGBT advocate Chris Jarvis, some in the trans community have suggested that if a man is dressed as a woman \u201cand it\u2019s not Halloween,\u201d they should be assumed to be trans. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true,\u201d said Jarvis, founder of Gay Central Valley, which operates the Fresno and Merced LGBT community centers. \u201cIt could be that this person was a cross-dresser and not trans. It\u2019s difficult to say that.\u201d \u201cWithout K.c. here to tell us, we may never know.\u201d Typically, LGBT activists prefer to identify someone based on the person\u2019s preferred gender pronoun. But Haggard\u2019s case has raised the complex question of what happens when a person is killed before that preference is clear to the people around them. According to Fresno Police, statements from relatives and roommates gave no indication that Haggard identified as a woman. That isn\u2019t uncommon for people newly transitioning, activists say. \u201cIf someone wants to come out as transgender, nine out of 10 times they lose their family,\u201d said Scot, the TransCare founder. \u201cMany will lose their jobs. Many will be shunned, ostracized, hated. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid. It\u2019s terrifying. We know who we are. The gender dysphoria drives us forwards. It\u2019s either transition or die.\u201d Despite the statements from family and friends, Haggard\u2019s attire that night \u2014 a dress, jewelry and a cardigan \u2014 is a clear sign that Haggard identified as a woman, Scot said. According to activists, there is also evidence online that Kenton Craig Haggard recently began using the name K.c. Haggard on Facebook. In one post on what appears to be Haggard\u2019s Facebook page, Haggard reviewed a local bar four months ago using that name: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cHey calling TG girls amber says we can hangout there. C U there K.c. Haggard,\u201d the message read. \u201c\u2018TG girls\u2019 is transgender girls, absolutely,\u201d Scot said. She added that somebody who works at the Fresno LGBT Community Center recalled seeing Haggard at group meetings for trans people in recent months. Police have said that based on the part of town where the killing occurred, along with the victim\u2019s dress, they believe Haggard might have been involved in prostitution, according to the Fresno Bee. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That suggestion has irked Scot, who said there is precious little evidence for police to make those assumptions either. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption, with no evidence, that she was a sex worker,\u201d Scot said. \u201cThis is what we face as transgender people all the time. We face a bias against us by law enforcement, but we are assumed not to be transgender and yet we are assumed as sex workers. \u201cWhy would they assume one and not look at the evidence for another.\u201d Police have said that they are looking for a suspect who they believe is a Hispanic male in his late 30s who also hired a prostitute in the hours after the killing. Dyer, the Fresno police chief, said the FBI is assisting in the investigation. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico READ MORE: _Transgender in the military: A Pentagon in transition weighs its policy_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Meet Kristin Beck, a transgender former Navy SEAL running for Congress_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _For transgender teens and teachers, acceptance could be two words away_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Transgender at five_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students Content: The Trump administration on Wednesday revoked federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity, taking a stand on a contentious issue that has become the central battle over LGBT rights. Officials with the federal Education and Justice departments notified the U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday that the administration is ordering the nation\u2019s schools to disregard memos the Obama administration issued during the past two years regarding transgender student rights. Those memos said that prohibiting transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity violates federal anti-discrimination laws. The two-page \u201cDear colleague\u201d letter from the Trump administration, which is set to go to the nation\u2019s public schools, does not offer any new guidance, instead saying that the earlier directive needed to be withdrawn because it lacked extensive legal analysis, did not go through a public vetting process, sowed confusion and drew legal challenges. The administration said that it would not rely on the prior interpretation of the law in the future. The departments wrote that the Trump administration wants to \u201cfurther and more completely consider the legal issues involved,\u201d and said that there must be \u201cdue regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\u201d Although it offered no clarity or direction to schools that have transgender students, the letter added that \u201cschools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment.\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that his department \u201chas a duty to enforce the law\u201d and criticized the Obama administration\u2019s guidance as lacking sufficient legal basis. Sessions wrote that the Department of Justice remains committed to the \u201cproper interpretation\u201d of the anti-discrimination law known as Title IX but said deference should be given to lawmakers and localities. \u201cCongress, state legislatures, and local governments are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue,\u201d Sessions said. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an issue \u201cbest solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find \u2014 and in many cases have found \u2014 solutions that protect all students.\u201d DeVos also gave assurances that the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights \u201cremains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools,\u201d and she noted that she considers \u201cprotecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America.\u201d The decision \u2014 delayed in part because DeVos and Sessions hit stalemates regarding timing and specific language \u2014 drew immediate condemnation from gay and transgender rights advocates, who accused President Trump of violating past promises to support gay and transgender protections. Advocates said the withdrawal of the federal guidance will create another layer of confusion for schools and will make transgender students, who are already vulnerable, more so. \u201cAttacking our children . . . is no way to say you support and respect LGBTQ people,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Others said the practical effect on the nation\u2019s schools would be muted, in part because a federal judge already had blocked the Obama guidance in response to a lawsuit from 13 states that argued it violated states\u2019 rights. And it is possible the U.S. Supreme Court could settle the matter soon, as it plans to consider a Virginia case involving a transgender teenager who was barred from using the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school. The Trump administration\u2019s move drew cheers from social conservatives who oppose the idea that a student can identify as a gender that differs from their anatomy at birth. Vicki Wilson, the mother of a child at Fremd High School in Palatine, Ill., said she sympathizes with children who have \u201cdifficult personal issues\u201d to deal with, but thinks that \u201cyoung men shouldn\u2019t be permitted to deal with those issues in an intimate setting like a locker room with young women.\u201d School district officials in Palatine, bowing to federal pressure, allowed a transgender girl to change in the girls\u2019 locker room at her school. \u201cNo school should impose a policy like this against the will of so many parents,\u201d Wilson said during a news conference organized by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal organization. The administration\u2019s letter was the source of some disagreement between the two issuing departments, with Sessions eager to rescind the Obama administration\u2019s guidance as court proceedings in related cases approached, and DeVos keen to leave it in place. Unlike Arne Duncan, Obama\u2019s education secretary for seven years, DeVos does not have a close personal relationship with the president she serves; she also lacks the experience and political capital Sessions garnered as a Republican senator. Sessions is widely known to oppose expanding gay and transgender rights, and DeVos\u2019s friends say she personally supports those rights. The new letter is sure to ignite another firestorm for DeVos, who is fresh off her contentious nomination fight and has drawn protests from parents and teachers who believe she is unqualified for the job. The letter also puts Trump squarely in the middle of the civil rights debate: Despite a flurry of activity in the early weeks of his presidency, Trump had not previously waded into the issue of gay and transgender rights. Trump declined to sign an executive order last month that would have dramatically expanded the rights of people, businesses and organizations of faith to opt out of laws or activities that violate their religion, such as same-sex wedding ceremonies. Many took it as a sign that he would take a more liberal approach on gay issues than his Republican cohorts. But in an interview with The Washington Post last year, then-candidate Donald Trump had indicated he would rescind the guidance based on the belief that it was a matter best left up to the states. In the daily news briefing Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer played down the reports of disagreement within the administration \u2014 saying the debate came down to timing and some specific wording \u2014 and reiterated the states\u2019 rights argument. \u201cThe president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he\u2019s a firm believer in states\u2019 rights,\u201d Spicer said. The Obama administration\u2019s guidance was based on the position that barring students from bathrooms that match their gender identities is a violation of Title IX because it amounts to sex discrimination. Many advocates contend the guidance merely formalized what courts have increasingly recognized: That discrimination against gay and transgender people is a form of sex discrimination because it is rooted in stereotypes about men and women. As a result, they believe transgender people already have the right under Title IX to use their preferred bathroom. The new letter scrambles the calculus for a number of lawsuits working their way through the courts, particularly the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender Virginia teen who sued his school board for barring him from the boys\u2019 restroom. The case is scheduled for oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court next month. A lower court cited the Obama administration\u2019s position on transgender student rights in siding with Grimm. Grimm said he was disheartened that the Trump administration is withdrawing the guidance. The Gloucester, Va., school board continued to bar him from the boys\u2019 bathroom even after the Obama guidance was issued, but Grimm said the directive was \u201cincredibly empowering.\u201d \u201cIt certainly bolstered hope that the future for transgender students was looking up in a way that it hadn\u2019t been previously,\u201d Grimm said. Amber Briggle, the mother of a 9-year-old transgender boy in Denton, Tex., said she views the Trump administration\u2019s position as a temporary setback and hopes that the Supreme Court will affirm transgender students\u2019 rights. But the withdrawal of the Obama directive is a blow, she said, because the guidance made her feel that Washington cared about children like hers and understood the support they need. \u201cI just don\u2019t think my family matters to the Trump administration,\u201d she said. Catherine Lhamon, who headed the Obama Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, said in a sworn declaration that the administration developed the guidance after receiving discrimination complaints from parents of transgender children and questions from teachers and administrators who were having to develop policies with regard to their transgender students. In 2011, the Education Department received two complaints of discrimination against transgender students in schools. By 2016, that number had leapt to 84, according to the declaration filed in federal court. In a kindergarten class where students line up by gender to go to the bathroom, \u201ca student has to decide which line to get into, and the teacher has to decide which line to accept that student into, and both of them have to field questions from other students in the class,\u201d Lhamon said in an interview. \u201cAny of those choices raises potential for discrimination and potential for harm that all of the students and teachers in a school have to navigate. It\u2019s not an abstraction for the people who live it every day.\u201d Lhamon said the withdrawal of the guidance and the notion that the federal government needs more time to consider the issue of transgender accommodations creates chaos in schools and sends a damaging message to children. Without federal guidance, schools are likely to look to their state governments for clarity, said Francisco Negron Jr., chief counsel for the National School Boards Association. That could open up battles across the country similar to one last year in North Carolina, when the legislature voted to require people in public buildings to use the restrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. Fifteen states have explicit protections for transgender students, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group; lawmakers in several other states are working to restrict bathroom access for transgender students. The American Civil Liberties Union, which tracks the legislation, said legislators in 14 states filed 20 bills that could lead to restroom restrictions for transgender people, with some proposing that states penalize schools that violate those restrictions. So far, five of those bills have failed. Many school districts held off on writing restroom policies as they waited for the outcome of the Grimm case. Among them was Fairfax County, Va., one of the largest districts in the nation, which was preparing to draft regulations on restroom access for transgender students to reflect its nondiscrimination policy. Elizabeth Schultz, a Fairfax County School Board member who opposes expanding the protections, said she hopes the new Trump administration action will lead the district to abandon its efforts. If the threat of revoking federal funds \u201cis no longer wielded against our local authority, there\u2019s no precipitating reason to continue,\u201d she said. **Read more:** Obama administration directs schools to accommodate transgender students Gavin Grimm just wanted to use the bathroom.

Kennedy picked his younger brother to be attorney general. President Trump might have picked the next closest thing. Jeff Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump at a time when few Republican lawmakers supported the candidate. His early and fierce loyalty \u2014 and his ability to translate Trump\u2019s nationalist instincts into policy \u2014 helped him forge a bond with the president, and he now enjoys access whenever he wants it, a privilege that few get, an official said. Two of Sessions\u2019s former Senate advisers \u2014 Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn \u2014 hold key White House roles, and one official said Sessions still talks to them regularly. The attorney general also is friendly with Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist and a powerful player in the administration who promoted Sessions for years on the Breitbart website. On Thursday, not long before Sessions recused himself from any investigations related to the Trump campaign, the president proclaimed that he had \u201ctotal\u201d confidence in his attorney general. Later, Trump issued a statement calling Sessions \u201can honest man\u201d who \u201cdid not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\u201d Trump also derided the \u201cwhole narrative\u201d as \u201ca way of face saving for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win,\u201d and he pointed \u2014 as he has in the past \u2014 to leaks of classified information as the \u201creal story.\u201d \u201cIt is a total witch hunt!\u201d Trump said. The remarks \u2014 which came as pressure mounted for Sessions to step aside from any investigations of Trump associates and Russia, or to resign altogether \u2014 demonstrate the high standing Sessions has in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, and the critical role he will play in carrying out the president\u2019s vision. Already, the administration has moved swiftly to implement policies that correspond with the worldview shared by Trump and Sessions. In his inaugural address, Trump spoke of rising crime and vowed to end the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d His attorney general, in his first speech, laid out how he plans to do that: a task force, a crackdown on drugs and an increased respect for police, who he suggested might see less aggressive scrutiny than they did under his predecessor. \u201cI do not believe that this pop in crime \u2014 this increase in crime \u2014 is necessarily an aberration, a one-time blip,\u201d Sessions told the National Association of Attorneys General. On immigration, an issue that has consumed much of Sessions\u2019s career, the ideological influence in Trump\u2019s policies is vivid and clear, and his Justice Department will be tasked with implementing \u2014 and defending \u2014 the president\u2019s plans. In the Senate, Sessions was a crusader for a hard-line stance on immigration, arguing that even legal immigration to the United States should be moderated. Trump has essentially implemented Sessions\u2019s ideas by executive action \u2014 calling for the hiring of more Customs and Border Protection agents, expanding the pool of those who are prioritized for removal, and temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. That last order has since been frozen by the courts, and Sessions\u2019s Justice Department, which has forcefully defended it, has been involved in crafting a new one. Sessions also has taken steps to undo the previous Justice Department\u2019s policy toward transgender children, changed its position on a Texas voting rights law the department had been fighting for years and reversed the previous administration\u2019s policy on the use of private prisons. His views on those topics match those of the president, who has cast himself a champion of private industry and alleged, without evidence, that massive voter fraud affected the election. During an internal White House debate over the transgender policy, Trump sided with Sessions over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, according to the New York Times. The attorney general holds a unique role in any presidential Cabinet \u2014 requiring the person in the job to implement the president\u2019s policy goals on one hand, while faithfully enforcing laws on the other. Sessions is not the first attorney general to enjoy a close relationship with the president. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., whose worldview was similar to President Barack Obama\u2019s, enjoyed status as the former president\u2019s favorite Cabinet member. Like Sessions, Holder came to know Obama before he ran for office and then joined him as a close adviser on the campaign trail. On issues such as same-sex marriage and the reform of a criminal justice system, which they both saw as deeply unfair to young black men, the two worked hand in hand as Holder executed policies that they both supported. Sessions and Trump met in 2005, when Sessions invited him to Washington to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing about his criticism of a U.N. project. Sessions was taken with the billionaire developer and later said it was the best congressional testimony he had ever heard. Two years ago, in June 2015, Trump and Sessions held a conference call on immigration policy. After that, Trump began trying to persuade Sessions to endorse him for president, and by January 2016 had, in essence, lent his top aide, Miller, to the Trump campaign. In February of last year at a rally in Alabama, Trump told the crowd that Sessions supported him, and Sessions donned a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat as he praised Trump, months after Sessions teased the possibility at a summer rally in Mobile. Observers on the campaign trail noted how different the two seemed. Trump is from the North, Sessions from the South. Trump is brash, while Sessions is soft-spoken. Sessions has been in politics for nearly 20 years; Trump is a businessman who had never before held elected office. But they bonded over their views on issues like immigration and law and order, with Trump\u2019s view of those issues influenced by his father, Fred, and his early years in business in New York, and how he saw global competition threaten the U.S. economy. Miller, a former Sessions aide, is the author of many of Trump\u2019s executive orders, and Dearborn, Sessions\u2019s longtime chief of staff, works to turn Trump\u2019s goals into law. In Trump\u2019s orbit, of course, support can evaporate in an instant, and it is hard to assess who is truly in power \u2014 aside from Trump himself. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said national security adviser Michael Flynn had the \u201cfull confidence\u201d of the president, and on the same day, Flynn resigned amid revelations that he had misled Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Yet Sessions so far has largely weathered the storm. He confirmed Thursday that he met twice with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, a fact he had omitted at his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general. At that hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign, and said, \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d Sessions said at a Justice Department news conference Thursday that he would provide the Judiciary Committee a written explanation for his testimony in the next day or two, while still insisting it was \u201chonest and correct as I understood it at the time.\u201d His explanation is that he was flustered by Franken\u2019s question \u2014 which referenced a breaking news story about contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. \u201cIt struck me very hard, and that\u2019s what I focused my answer on,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times. That would be the ambassador.\u201d Sessions said he would now recuse himself from any investigations having to do with the Trump campaign and insisted he had been talking with Justice Department ethics officials about doing so even before news broke of his meetings with Kislyak. Not long before, Trump himself had said he did not believe Sessions needed to do so. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had also said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to recuse himself\u201d and said those criticizing Sessions were \u201cchoosing to play partisan politics.\u201d Sessions said he told the White House counsel what he planned to do Thursday afternoon, but they perhaps didn\u2019t know or understand the rules as he did. \u201cI should not be involved investigating a campaign I had a role in,\u201d Sessions said.", "Title: Hill Democrats slam Trump\u2019s military transgender ban, while GOP is caught by surprise Content: Lawmakers in both parties slammed President Trump\u2019s decision on Wednesday to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military, while many of his allies on Capitol Hill remained largely perplexed or silent. The president\u2019s decision, announced in a series of tweets, is yet another move that confused and divided elements of his party at a time when it is already roiled by disagreements over the future of a proposed health-care overhaul and of embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced a barrage of criticism from Trump in recent days. Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.), a former Army officer, said \u201cit throws us off\u201d when Trump issues surprise tweets that distract from other GOP priorities. \u201cBased on what we\u2019re doing in here this week, I don\u2019t know what the connection is,\u201d he said. Capitol Hill\u2019s most prominent Republican voice on national security matters, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), also criticized Trump\u2019s announcement, calling it \u201cunclear\u201d and \u201cyet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter.\u201d McCain added, \u201cThere is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train, and deploy to leave the military \u2014 regardless of their gender identity.\u201d He said there should be no change in policy until the Pentagon completes an ongoing review of the issue. Other conservative senators offered criticism of the move. A spokeswoman for Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), an Army veteran and member of the Armed Services Committee, said that the senator believes \u201cAmericans who are qualified and can meet the standards to serve in the military should be afforded that opportunity,\u201d though the military should not fund gender-reassignment surgery. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a Trump ally on most issues, said he wanted \u201cmore information and clarity\u201d on Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be discriminating against anyone,\u201d he said, adding that transgender people \u201cdeserve the best we can do for them.\u201d And Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of an Appropriations subcommittee that sets Pentagon spending levels, said he expected Congress to call hearings exploring Trump\u2019s policy change. \u201cYou ought to treat everybody fairly and give everybody a chance to serve,\u201d he told CNN. Most Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, remained mum in the hours immediately after the announcement Wednesday. A House Republican aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about internal matters, said that while GOP leaders were aware of a White House review of the issue of transgender service members, they were not given heads-up about the announcement and that it was \u201cway beyond what we expected.\u201d One Republican lawmaker who offered early support for the policy change on social media was Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who recently offered an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that would have blocked the Pentagon from offering gender transition therapies to active-duty service members. \u201cPleased to hear that @realDonaldTrump shares my readiness and cost concerns, & will be changing this costly and damaging policy,\u201d she said on Twitter. But a GOP colleague, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), who has a transgender son, weighed in against the policy: \u201cNo American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement comes two weeks after the House rejected Hartzler\u2019s amendment in a closely watched vote. Twenty-four Republicans joined all 190 Democrats voting to reject the measure. But the issue has remained a pet cause for House conservatives who believe the federal government should not be funding gender reassignments. Conservatives have offered several amendments to a pending appropriations bill funding the military that would target transgender service members. But those amendments, which could come up for a vote Thursday, would not exclude them from serving entirely. During the debate on the initial amendment, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee who also served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, argued for the therapy restriction but explicitly stopped short of calling for an overall ban. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping transgender people from joining,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying taxpayers in this country right now are not going to foot the bill for it.\u201d The defense policy bill has yet to move through the Senate, though Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has indicated that could happen in the coming weeks. McCain, who is still determining how to treat an aggressive form of brain cancer, is poised to lead floor debate on the legislation. Opponents of Trump\u2019s policy could use the legislation to amend the bill to overturn it. A handful of Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), said they were preparing legislation to do so. Gillibrand, who has used her perch on the Senate Armed Services Committee to push for greater protections for women in uniform, said Wednesday that she would pursue legislation to \u201coverturn this discriminatory decision.\u201d The defense bill, always seen as one of the few must-pass bills of the year, is often used as a way to launch proxy battles in the decades-long culture wars that pit social conservatives against progressives. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle often introduce legislation to restrict or expand abortion protections at military medical installations, to enact stricter rules against sexual harassment or rape in the ranks, or in more recent years, to restrict or roll back protections for transgender troops. The last time the annual defense bill was used to make a significant change in social policy was 2010, when lawmakers voted to roll back the Clinton-era \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d rule that banned gay men and lesbians from openly serving in uniform. But transgender service was left in flux, in part because its fate has been dictated by internal Pentagon medical policy, not law. If Trump\u2019s tweets signal a change in policy, then \u201cthis is a president hell-bent determined to wreak havoc in the ranks \u2014 the very thing he said he didn\u2019t want to do he\u2019s proposed doing,\u201d said Aubrey Sarvis, a private attorney and gay rights advocate who used to lead Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the group that pushed to end the gay troop ban. \u201cIf he seeks to do this as commander in chief by ordering his subordinates to act on this, the Defense Department is going to be faced with a barrage of lawsuits.\u201d \u201cThis is a wake up call and defining moment for the LGBT community. We have to rise up and oppose this president,\u201d Sarvis added. The seven openly gay members of Congress quickly denounced the change. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who is also running for Colorado governor, said, \u201cTrump makes our military weaker by arbitrarily kicking out high-performing soldiers based solely on gender identity.\u201d Other Democrats flooded social media and email inboxes with statements objecting to the change. Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201can unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country.\u201d \u201cThese service members are defending the United States around the world as we speak, and they have long done so with distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cTo prevent transgender people from joining the military and to push out those who have devoted their lives to this country would be ugly and discriminatory in the extreme.\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) noted that Trump made his announcement on the 69th anniversary of President Harry Truman\u2019s executive order desegregating the military, adding that the president \u201chas chosen this day to unleash a vile and hateful agenda that will blindside thousands of patriotic Americans.\u201d \u201cTransgender Americans are serving honorably in our military,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.). \u201cWe stand with these patriots.\u201d Several Democratic military veterans also lambasted Trump\u2019s decision. Rep. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), a Marine veteran of the Iraq War, accused Trump of \u201cusing fear of Trans community to score political points.\u201d \u201cBanning any qualified person from serving their country, because of who they are is both discriminatory and bad national security policy,\u201d he tweeted. And Rep. Anthony G. Brown (Md.), a retired Army Reserve colonel, called it \u201ca dark day for our Armed Forces and our nation.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s rationale harkens back to a more ignorant and intolerant time, where words like \u2018disruption\u2019 and \u2018not a social experiment\u2019 were used to keep women, African Americans and gays and lesbians from fully participating in our military services,\u201d he said.", "Title: GOP lawmakers openly defy president as frustration mounts Content: They passed legislation to stop him from lifting sanctions on Russia. They recoiled at his snap decision to ban transgender Americans from the military. And they warned him in no uncertain terms not to fire the attorney general or the special counsel investigating the president and his aides. Republican lawmakers have openly defied President Trump in meaningful ways this week amid growing frustration on Capitol Hill with his surprise tweets, erratic behavior and willingness to trample on governing norms. But at the same time, they\u2019ve worked to advance legislation they want him to sign. In the latest signs of a backlash, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he would not hold hearings on a replacement if Trump dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Thursday he would pursue legislation that would prevent Trump from summarily firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \u201cSome of the suggestions that the president is making go way beyond what\u2019s acceptable in a rule-of-law nation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is not draining the swamp. What he\u2019s interjecting is turning democracy upside down.\u201d Some of the defiance came from already outspoken Trump critics such as Graham and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who rebuked the president from the Senate floor Thursday. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the attorney general, forget about it,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cThe presidency isn\u2019t a bull, and this country isn\u2019t a china shop.\u201d But some generally pro-Trump lawmakers emerged Wednesday as critics of the unexpected transgender ban, which the president announced in a series of morning tweets with no notice to key figures on Capitol Hill who might normally be called upon to defend his actions. Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued statements Wednesday saying Trump went too far in banning all transgender service members. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to back the ban, saying he would await a Defense Department review of the issue despite Trump\u2019s clear wishes. \u201cI look forward to seeing what they actually produce,\u201d Ryan said. On the sanctions issue, the Senate, on a 98-to-2 vote on Thursday, cleared legislation targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea that the Trump administration had sought to water down \u2014 particularly a provision that would require Trump to seek congressional approval before lifting sanctions against Russia. The bill had passed the House earlier this week on a 419-to-3 vote. Several lawmakers said that if Trump vetoes the measure, Congress was prepared to override it. \u201cNo president likes Congress to tie their hands,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cThis is a very unique and particular case at a key moment. . . . If the president vetoes it, as is his right, there will be a debate, but I believe it will be overridden.\u201d Despite the brush backs, Republican lawmakers are continuing to act on key parts of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Those items, however, face major hurdles. The House on Thursday cleared a package of spending bills that boost defense spending and earmark $1.6 billion to build 74 miles of border fencing \u2014 making good on Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d to separate the United States and Mexico. The bill, however, breaks existing budget caps. Any final spending agreement will have to be negotiated later in the year with Democrats, who have so far refused to support any wall funding. The Senate, meanwhile, continued working haltingly toward passage of a health-care bill that swallowed much of the attention and energy on Capitol Hill. On Thursday evening, a group of senators that included Graham and John McCain (R-Ariz.) faced television cameras inside the Capitol to make an unusual declaration: They would vote for the health-care bill in the Senate only if they were assured by House Republican leaders that they would not in turn pass it into law. The senators\u2019 hope was to convene a conference committee, an open-ended negotiation that could keep the internal battle over replacing the Affordable Care Act alive for months. The effort would potentially distract from other contentious issues, such as a tax overhaul. That tax initiative took a modest step forward Thursday when key White House officials and congressional leaders issued a joint statement of principles for the overhaul \u2014 one that discarded a controversial tax on corporate imports favored by Ryan. The House, however, has yet to pass a 2018 budget, a key initial step Republicans are counting on to be able to pass the tax overhaul without involving Democrats. House GOP aides indicated Friday that the matter would be left until September, after a planned five-week recess. Lawmakers in September will have to confront a possible government shutdown and federal default. The most palpable frustration on Capitol Hill, however, tends not to concern health care or tax reform or appropriations, but rather Trump\u2019s chaotic White House and his Twitter musings. Recent weeks have seen lawmakers who have brushed aside Trump\u2019s antics by calling him \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201cunconventional\u201d more willing to voice their concerns. After the transgender tweetstorm Wednesday, Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.) expressed frustration that Trump\u2019s tweets come out of nowhere, leaving GOP lawmakers out of step with the president. \u201cWhen we do stuff in here that we\u2019re trying to message, and there\u2019s a tweet that comes out that\u2019s different than that, it throws us off,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on what we\u2019re doing in here this week, I don\u2019t know what the connection is.\u201d Especially alarming to congressional Republicans are Trump\u2019s recent tweets about Sessions and Mueller \u2014 such as a Saturday tweet asking why the two are not investigating alleged \u201ccrimes\u201d by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and by former FBI director James B. Comey. A subsequent tweet Tuesday accused Sessions of taking \u201ca VERY weak position\u201d on investigating Clinton and leakers of intelligence secrets. Sessions has seen an outpouring of support this week from his former colleagues in the Senate, where he served for two decades. \u201cI think the president has to keep in mind a couple of things,\u201d Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said Thursday. \u201cJeff Sessions, like all Cabinet members, works for the United States of America. They don\u2019t work for the president; they work for the people. . . . The president\u2019s a smart man, and he ought to know that.\u201d Meanwhile, key lawmakers have voiced confidence in Mueller. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the president\u2019s interest that he stays where he is and continues and does his job,\u201d Ryan said Thursday. Graham said Thursday that a move against Mueller would represent \u201cthe beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u201d His bill, which he said he is drafting in conjunction with Democratic colleagues, would require a federal judge to review any move to dismiss a special counsel. Fellow Republicans offered support for the move. \u201cI hope that it doesn\u2019t become needed,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is pursuing his own investigation of Trump as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The Chang\u2019e 4 mission is planned for sometime before 2020, Zou Yongliao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 moon exploration department told state broadcaster CCTV in an interview broadcast last week. Zou said the mission\u2019s objective would be to study geological conditions on the moon\u2019s far side, also known as the dark side. That could eventually lead to the placement of a radio telescope for use by astronomers, something that would help \u201cfill a void\u201d in man\u2019s knowledge of the universe, Zou said. Radio transmissions from Earth are unable to reach the moon\u2019s far side, making it an excellent location for sensitive instruments. China\u2019s next lunar mission \u2014 an attempt to land an unmanned spaceship on the moon before returning to Earth with samples \u2014 is scheduled for 2017. If successful, that would make China only the third country after the United States and Russia to have carried out such a maneuver. China\u2019s lunar exploration program, named Chang\u2019e after a mythical goddess, has already launched a pair of orbiting lunar probes, and in 2013 it landed a craft on the moon with a rover on board. China has also hinted at a possible crewed mission to the moon. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has powered ahead with a series of methodically timed steps, including the deployment of an experimental space station.", "Title: Photo: Chinese lunar probe provides uncommon perspective of moon and Earth Content: A Chinese probe, which was designed as a test-run on the road to a full lunar landing, has successfully completed its trip to the moon and back. On its return to Earth, the probe captured a view rarely seen in photographs. The image shows the back side of the moon in the foreground, with the Earth off in the distance in the upper left, 240,000 miles away. The successful return of the probe is just another step in China\u2019s lunar exploration mission, the goal of which is to land a probe on the surface of the moon, collect samples, and then return them to Earth. China has now successfully launched a probe, landed one on the moon, and returned one to Earth. It will take multiple probes to complete the mission, each one used in a different part of testing. The final probe will complete the sample collection and return to Earth.

They aim to dock with an orbiting space lab and remain aboard for 30 days, a crucial step in China\u2019s plans to operate its own space station by 2022 and part of a much broader space program that has ambitions to put astronauts back on the moon and land an unmanned rover on Mars. State-run China Central Television (CCTV) showed the Shenzhou 11 spacecraft taking off from a launch center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northern China at 7:30 a.m., carried by a Long March 2F rocket. The astronauts were seen on board saluting seconds before takeoff. They will dock with the Tiangong-2 lab in two days and conduct scientific experiments, testing computers as well as propulsion and life-support systems, CCTV reported. After the launch was declared a success, Defense Minister Fan Changlong read a congratulatory message from President Xi Jinping that called for China\u2019s astronauts to explore space \u201cmore deeply and more broadly.\u201d Xi also encouraged them to \u201cconstantly break new ground for the manned space program, so that Chinese people will take bigger steps and march further in [their] space probe, to make new contributions to the building of China into a space power.\u201d The astronauts are Jing Haipeng, who will turn 50 during the trip and is flying his third mission, and Chen Dong, 37. \u201cIt is any astronaut\u2019s dream and pursuit to be able to perform many space missions,\u201d Jing said Sunday, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. China is spending heavily on a space program that aims to catch up with the United States and Russia, both established space powers, and outpace Asian rivals India and Japan. As in all those countries, the space program in China is a source of great national pride. China was excluded from participation in the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns that its space program had a strong military component. Instead, it aims to build its own space station and hopes that other countries also will launch missions there. It insists that its motives are peaceful. \u201cShenzhou 11 is a new beginning. It marks the imminent end to the exploratory stage of China\u2019s manned space program,\u201d said Zhang Yulin, deputy commander in chief of China\u2019s manned space program and deputy chief of the armament development department of the Central Military Commission. Zhang said China hopes to carry out regular space missions after 2020, sending astronauts, engineers and even tourists into space several times a year, Xinhua reported. It will be the only country operating a space station after the International Space Station is retired in 2024. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, and 10 years later it landed the Jade Rabbit rover on the moon \u2014 the first \u201csoft landing\u201d there in nearly four decades \u2014 although the rover later developed technical problems. It aims to land a rover on the far side of the moon by 2018 and send an unmanned vehicle to Mars by 2020, emulating the U.S. Viking landers in 1976. Ultimately, it hopes to land an astronaut on the moon by about 2025, more than five decades after American Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The current mission, lasting 33 days, is more than twice the length of China\u2019s last manned mission, in 2013, which spanned 15 days. Shenzhou means \u201cdivine vessel,\u201d while Tiangong means \u201cheavenly palace.\u201d", "Title: China carries out the first soft landing on the moon in 37 years Content: BEIJING \u2014 China completed the first soft landing on the moon\u2019s surface in 37 years Saturday, becoming only the third country to pull off the feat. State television showed scientists in white and pale-blue coats applauding, shaking hands and congratulating each other after the craft, Chang\u2019e 3, landed safely at 9:12 p.m. local time. It also showed photographs of the moon\u2019s surface beamed back from the craft. The landing marked a significant advance in China\u2019s space program and a step toward its ambitions of one day following the United States in mounting a manned lunar mission. On Sunday, a six-wheeled rover named Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, is scheduled to emerge from the landing vehicle and begin a three-month-long mission to explore the moon\u2019s surface. The moon lander, which weighs more than a ton, landed in the right eye of the lunar feature dubbed the Man in the Moon, in a large and relatively flat volcanic crater known as the Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows. Its rockets shut off when it was about four yards above the surface, and the craft fell the remaining distance. The landing craft, which is designed to remain in place and operate for a year, carries a telescope that will survey space from the moon\u2019s surface and an ultraviolet camera that will observe the Earth and the plasmasphere surrounding it. The rover, which will roam around for three months, will not only analyze the topsoil in a previously unexplored region of the moon but also will collect through its radar system information about the lunar surface to a depth of 100 yards. Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said the radar system, in particular, would yield useful data. \u201cChina has said that to be a global power, you do have to contribute to the global pool of scientific knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moon, for all that it is our closest celestial neighbor, is rather unexplored. . . . China is, in fact, contributing to the pool of lunar knowledge.\u201d The rover will be powered by solar panels during the lunar day, and atomic energy storage batteries will keep it warm and prevent its electronic systems from freezing during the lunar night, which lasts the equivalent of two weeks on Earth and can see temperatures as low as 180 degrees below zero Celsius, the equivalent of 292 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. \u201cCompared to the last century\u2019s space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, mankind\u2019s current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe,\u201d Sun Huixian, the project\u2019s deputy chief engineer told the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cChina\u2019s lunar program is an important component of mankind\u2019s activities to explore the peaceful use of space.\u201d The lander and the rover are named for a Chinese myth about a woman named Chang\u2019e who swallowed magic pills and took her pet rabbit, Yutu, to the moon, where she has lived as a goddess ever since. \u201cThough people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate, it doesn\u2019t change its splendid role in Chinese traditional culture,\u201d Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Beijing\u2019s Peking University, told Xinhua. China hopes to mount another mission to the moon in 2017 that would collect rock and soil samples. It also hopes to launch a space station by about 2023 and eventually, perhaps, establish lunar bases and send missions into deep space. Its space program has the advantage of consistent funding and top-level political support, and the successful moon landing will ensure that continues, Cheng said. \u201cThis was a big step,\u201d said Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \u201cIt makes [a manned mission] far more feasible.\u201d China\u2019s space program has established itself as a significant player globally, Johnson-Freese said. \u201cIt wants to work with developed countries to show it is a major space nation,\u201d she said, adding that China\u2019s program has also encouraged other countries, such as India, to invest more in space exploration to show they are not falling behind in the technological race. The program is a source of deep national pride and was widely celebrated Saturday by users of the weibo microblogging sites. \u201cAt this moment my eyes are full of tears, I\u2019m proud of my motherland, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Chinese,\u201d wrote Huanranbingshi2000. MissK-Xiaoqiu posted: \u201cChina is mighty! It\u2019s so thrilling.\u201d But a minority of users appeared less impressed. \u201cSo . . . the poor are still suffering from hunger, corrupt officials are still corrupt,\u201d one wrote. \u201cA lot of countries can\u2019t land on the moon, but they can make houses affordable, tuition fees affordable, medical care affordable. I think that is a better reason to be proud,\u201d wrote another. Chinese media reported this month that more than 160,000 people were temporarily evacuated from their homes after the launch of the rocket carrying the moon lander dumped debris on two farm buildings. The last soft landing on the moon was by the unmanned Soviet Luna 24 probe, which collected soil samples in 1976.", "Title: NASA strategy can\u2019t get humans to Mars, says National Research Council spaceflight report Content: A sweeping review of NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program has concluded that the agency has an unsustainable and unsafe strategy that will prevent the United States from achieving a human landing on Mars in the foreseeable future. The 286-page National Research Council report, the culmination of an 18-month, $3.2 million investigation mandated by Congress, says that to continue on the present course under budgets that don\u2019t keep pace with inflation \u201cis to invite failure, disillusionment, and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the United States does best.\u201d The report makes a case for sending astronauts back to the moon. That had been a key element of NASA\u2019s strategy under President George W. Bush. But President Obama and his advisers explicitly opposed another moon landing (\u201cI just have to say pretty bluntly here: We\u2019ve been there before,\u201d Obama said in a speech on space policy in 2010). A major argument against returning to the moon was that it didn\u2019t pencil out \u2014 that there wasn\u2019t nearly enough money dedicated to the program. Now the NRC\u2019s Committee on Human Spaceflight has come to the same conclusion about the Obama administration\u2019s vision for NASA. If the goal is a human landing on Mars, the current strategy won\u2019t work. \u201cAbsent a very fundamental change in the nation\u2019s way of doing business, it is not realistic to believe that we can achieve the consensus goal of reaching Mars,\u201d Mitch Daniels, the former Indiana governor and co-chair of the committee, said Wednesday morning in an interview. A 2009 committee appointed by Obama urged NASA to keep its options open while investing in spaceflight technology and letting the commercial sector handle routine trips to low Earth orbit. But the NRC reviewers argue that NASA and its international partners should focus on the \u201chorizon goal\u201d of Mars and do whatever it takes to get there, step by step, avoiding changes in strategic direction. NASA officials, aware that critics see the agency as adrift, say they have already been moving in the direction advocated by the NRC. Their strategy targets Mars, just as the NRC report now demands, they say. \u201cAll this work will eventually enable astronaut missions to Mars,\u201d NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a recent NASA white paper. \u201cNASA\u2019s been doing some work, and has been doing some thinking over the last six months, that is in alignment with what the NRC says the top-level goals are,\u201d said Greg Williams, a NASA deputy associate administrator. But Williams was cool to the suggestion of a return to the moon, saying the airless moon offers little help in developing the kind of descent and landing techniques needed on Mars, which has a thin, troublesome atmosphere. The NRC committee probed the philosophical question of why we send people into space to begin with. The committee concluded that the purely practical, economic benefits of human spaceflight do not justify the costs but that the aspirational nature of the endeavor may make it worth the effort. The report says the United States should pursue international collaborations that would include China \u2014 currently treated as a space rival and not as a potential partner. The report cites three potential pathways to Mars, two involving a return to the moon. A lunar landing and habitat would help develop technologies that could later be used on a Mars mission, the report says. The third pathway is essentially the one that the Obama administration has chosen, which includes the Asteroid Redirect Mission. The plan, still being studied, would use a robotic spacecraft to grab a small asteroid that is orbiting the sun and passing close to the Earth and then tug the asteroid to a new orbit around the moon. Astronauts would then go to the rock and take samples. The mission architecture would take advantage of big- ticket NASA projects already underway. Most notably, it would provide a destination for the Orion capsule being developed by NASA in tandem with a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS). The asteroid mission has been politically controversial \u2014 Republicans in Congress unsuccessfully tried last year to forbid NASA to do it \u2014 and it has technical challenges, not the least of which is the difficulty identifying an asteroid that could plausibly be captured by a robotic spacecraft. The NRC report is not bullish on the idea. The report says the mission involves the creation of a large number of \u201cdead end\u201d technologies that don\u2019t get the United States closer to a Mars landing. The committee raised a safety issue. The current schedule calls for an unmanned SLS launch in 2017, followed by a mission with a crew in 2021. The committee feared that launch teams could become rusty with long lags between missions. The program \u201ccannot provide the flight frequency required to maintain competence and safety,\u201d the report states. NASA official Williams said Wednesday that the cadence of launches will speed up after 2021. The committee did not delve deeply into what the private sector, operating commercially, might accomplish independently of the government. There are many space buffs, including SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who have said they want to land on Mars. But committee member John Sommerer said Wednesday that it is unrealistic to expect a commercial company to spend the money and take on the risk necessary to achieve human exploration on the Martian surface. \u201cYou need to develop a very substantial armamentarium of really high-tech stuff to get humans on Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cMars is very hard.\u201d John Logsdon, professor emeritus of George Washington University\u2019s Space Policy Institute, said the report has a familiar ring to it. \u201cThey go through all this negative analysis and still conclude we ought to go to Mars. No one ever says, \u2018Let\u2019s lower our ambitions.\u2019 It\u2019s always, \u2018Increase the budget,\u2019 not \u2018Lower ambitions,\u2019 \u201d he said. As for going to Mars: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream. It\u2019s been a dream forever. And will remain a dream unless something changes.\u201d More from The Washington Post: Kepler telescope finds a \u2018Mega-Earth NASA explores a possible mission to Mars Gallery: When NASA and space travel were young This is SpaceX\u2019s new Dragon V2 spacecraft.

Content: _\u201cSince Sandy Hook there has been a school shooting, on average, every week. How on earth can we live with ourselves if we do nothing?\u201d_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **\u2014 Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.),speech on Senate floor, June 24, 2015** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The shooting rampage that killed nine churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., has again sparked debate over gun control and mass gun violence. Lawmakers pushing for stronger gun control measures are expressing outrage at the prevalence of mass shootings \u2014 often evoking the deaths of 20 children and six staff members during the December 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Murphy\u2019s speech on gun violence focused on Sandy Hook, mass shootings and the need to talk about anti-gun violence policy. He shared an eye-popping statistic: Since the shooting at Sandy Hook, there has been one school shooting on average per week. Is that really the case \u2014 that there have been somewhere around 128 school shootings since December 2014? A version of this claim circulated after the June 2014 incident in Oregon in which a high school freshman armed with an assault rifle shot and killed a student and injured a teacher. President Obama and other gun-control advocates had said then that there had been at least 74 school shootings between Sandy Hook and the Oregon shooting. The source for the claim then, and for Murphy\u2019s recent statement, is a report by Everytown for Gun Safety, which describes itself as \u201ca movement of Americans working together to end gun violence and build safer communities.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The group keeps a tally of school shootings since Sandy Hook, counting at least 126 as of June 8, 2015. The group uses a broad definition of school shooting: when a firearm is discharged on school or campus grounds at K-12 schools and colleges. This is how the group explains its methodology: This list comprises a variety of shootings at or near a school, including: attempted and committed suicides, accidental discharges, armed robberies, gang fights, shootings resulting from altercations, and shootings similar to the rampages at Sandy Hook or in Charleston, where a person intends to kill multiple people. When Everytown first released its tally in 2014, media organizations gave it a lot of publicity \u2014 but then had second thoughts once it became clear it was such a broad list. CNN, for instance, initially reported the \u201c74\u201d figure but then determined that only 15 cases were similar to Newtown. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Fact Checker analyzed each case included in the updated list. Of the 126 cases, 25 were attempted or committed suicides. The majority of the shootings on this list were targeted attacks against individuals stemming from altercations or ongoing conflicts. Below is a sample of non-suicide incidents included in the list that shows a range of the type of events: There were at least 10 incidents that were similar to shooting in Newtown, with one shooter opening fire with the intent to kill or injure multiple victims. A separate incident in June 2015 involved a couple that shot and killed a cat on a school campus, but had told law enforcement officials they would have shot students if it were \u201cGod\u2019s will.\u201d We did not include that in the list of 10 incidents. There is not a standard way to count what constitutes a \u201cschool shooting.\u201d PolitiFact Oregon, for instance, narrowed Everytown\u2019s list down to 35 school shootings, counting incidents in which a shooter was on campus during school hours. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A review of government studies on gun violence at schools showed narrower methods. For example, the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 2013 report on school crime and safety specifically looks at the percentage of students who have access to a loaded gun without adult permission, at or away from school, during the school year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In the period between 2000 and 2013, the FBI identified 160 active shooter incidents, where one or more shooters \u201cactively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.\u201d It used this definition to describe instances like Sandy Hook or the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007. This study did not include gang or drug violence or other shootings that did not generally put other people in peril (e.g., accidental discharge of a firearm in a school building or a person committing suicide in a parking lot). *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The FBI found that education environments were the second-largest location grouping for active shooters, totaling 39 incidents at K-12 and institutes of higher education from 2000 to 2013. Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, said he has not seen an authoritative data source or universal definition on \u201cschool shootings.\u201d Trump noted the Bureau of Justice Statistics\u2019 annual \u201cIndicators of School Crime and Safety\u201d report, which defines School Associated Violent Deaths as \u201ca homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cFederal and state statistics tend to grossly underestimate the extent of school crime and violence. Public perception tends to overstate it. Reality exists somewhere in between these two, but in terms of actual real numbers, nobody honestly knows exactly where this \u2018somewhere\u2019 is,\u201d Trump said. Chris Harris, Murphy\u2019s spokesman, said it all comes down to how one defines \u201cschool shooting,\u201d and that Murphy defines it as \u201cgunfire on school property.\u201d \u201cSenator Murphy believes that schools are no place for deadly weapons. Any and all gunfire in or around the classroom is unacceptable and must be stopped. Others can quibble over what amount of gunfire in a school they want to call a \u2018shooting,\u2019 but Sen. Murphy remains focused on stopping such events altogether,\u201d Harris said. There are many ways to define school shooting. But applying the \u201creasonable person\u201d standard, as is the standard at The Fact Checker, it is difficult to see how many of the incidents included in Everytown\u2019s list \u2014 such as suicide in a car parked on a campus or a student accidentally shooting himself when emptying his gun and putting it away in his car before school \u2014 would be considered a \u201cschool shooting\u201d in the context of Sandy Hook. Lawmakers have a responsibility to check out the facts in the reports they use, especially ones that come from advocacy groups. If they are aware there are definitions that are disputed, or that are defined in other ways depending on who uses them, it is incumbent on lawmakers to clarify exactly what they are talking about and not mislead the public. In particular, lawmakers should rely more on official government statistics, such as from the FBI, rather than misleading metrics cobbled together by interest groups. We wavered between Three and Four Pinocchios. But this is a definition of \u201cschool shooting\u201d that was widely disputed a year ago, and lawmakers need to present information \u2014 especially for such a controversial topic as gun control \u2014 in a clear, responsible and accurate way. Murphy\u2019s failure to do so tipped the rating to Four.

That\u2019s five times as many as have been killed by guns in the District in 12 years. Nationwide, it has taken four months for the gun deaths of children under the age of 10 to equal the number killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Criminologists say the shootings at the school have stunned the country because they force everyone to confront the rarest and most shocking of deaths: young children killed en masse by a stranger wielding a gun at their school. \u201cThis is an act that is literally unprecedented in the U.S. \u2014 the mass slaughter of so many children by one person,\u201d said Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. \u201cThis is a very, very unusual phenomenon.\u201d The Connecticut shootings \u201cresemble more the acts of terrorists who prey on and kill large numbers of an innocent people than they do the everyday firearm killings,\u201d Rosenfeld said. Since September, 20 children under 10 have been killed by guns in the United States. Eight were accidental and four were domestic killings, while eight were either bystander shootings or homicides by nonrelatives. None involved schools, and only one involved an outsider who killed more than one child. On Sept. 1, Kahlil Singleton, 8, was fatally shot in Hilton Head, S.C., while playing in his grandmother\u2019s front yard. The boy was caught in the crossfire of a neighborhood feud involving several adults. A month later, Jorge Duran III, 3, was shot and killed by his father in the family\u2019s apartment near Toledo, Ohio. The boy\u2019s mother also was slain. And earlier this month, Ryder Rozier, 3, accidentally shot and killed himself in Logan County, Okla., with a gun he found on a nightstand in his uncle\u2019s house. His uncle is an Oklahoma state trooper. Richard Berk, a professor of statistics and criminology at the University of Pennsylania, said that young children are more at risk of being killed by someone they know than by strangers. \u201cThese stranger killings are horrible, but [children are] more at risk from a family member or someone in their neighborhood,\u201d he said. Although the number of youngsters killed by guns in this country steadily inched upward from 2008 to 2010, last week\u2019s massacre of 20 first- and second-graders at Sandy Hook remains a statistical anomaly among rampage killings. In a study of 62 mass shootings in America since 1982 by Mother Jones magazine, only two cases involved elementary school children shot at their schools. In 1989, at the Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton, Calif., a deranged man killed five children and wounded 29 before committing suicide. In 2006, a man killed five students at a one-room Amish schoolhouse in Pennsylvania. Three of the dead were under age 10. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, said that people shoot young children because \u201cthey are the most precious members of society.\u201d \u201cIf your intention is to get payback for society being unfair to you, then killing children hurts the most,\u201d Fox said. Between 1999 and 2010, firearms cut short the lives of 1,705 children in the United States under the age of 10, including 21 in Maryland and 49 in Virginia, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths of young children from gunshots are dwarfed by fatalities from other causes during that time: 8,499 drownings and nearly 16,000 in traffic accidents. In the District, where homicides claimed the lives of 2,294 people between 2000 and 2011, four were under the age of 10, according to police records. Three involved children being killed by stray bullets. Donte Manning, 9, died when a stray bullet pierced him as he played outside his Columbia Heights neighborhood in March 2005. Chelsea Cromartie, 8, died in May 2004 when an errant bullet smashed through her family\u2019s living room window in Northeast. Darias Branch, 4, was found dead with his mother in a second-floor apartment in Southeast in October 2007, and Oscar Fuentes, 9, died when a bullet penetrated the front door of his family\u2019s Columbia Heights apartment in November 2009. The rate in the District of deaths of children under 10 by gunfire is roughly double the national average of 0.24 per 100,000 population over the decade-long study period. Among the young victims killed nationwide by guns since 1999, nearly 60 percent were white and 61 percent male. About 1,280 of the deaths were homicides and 380 were unintentional, according to the CDC data. The causes of 45 deaths were undetermined, and two were suicide. Less than one percent of all homicides among school-age children happen on school grounds or on the way to or from school, according to the CDC\u2019s School Associated Violent Death Study. \u201cThe vast majority of students will never experience lethal violence at school,\u201d the study found. Although the question of why 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza opened fire at the school may never be answered, Fox said that if the shooter had a negative experience as a child and wanted to get even with his school, the students were the \u201csurrogates.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s oftentimes murder by proxy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re linked to the primary target. You can\u2019t kill a school but you can kill kids and teachers to get even with the school.\u201d In 2001, 160 children under 10 died by gunfire, the highest annual number between 1999 and 2010. The number dropped to 142 the following year, with a significant decline to 119 in 2003 and 2004, according to the CDC. Sixty-three of the 143 victims in 2006 were preschoolers under 5. In 2010, the most recent year that the CDC reported the statistics, 155 children under 10 died from gunfire. An overwhelming number of the gun deaths occurred in the South \u2014 821 \u2014 six times as many as occurred in the Northeast, according to the data. Nearly 400 happened in the West and 360 in the Midwest. Fox said firearm deaths are higher in South, in part, because of relaxed gun laws and the prevalence of guns. \u201cGun laws in South Carolina and Georgia are not like they are in Massachusetts and New York,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of guns used in crimes in the North come from the South.\u201d Culture and upbringing also play a role in the rate of gun deaths, Fox said. \u201cIn the South, to resolve a dispute, you take it outside,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the North, you take it to court.\u201d Bonnie Berkowitz contributed to this report.", "Title: The world responds to Sandy Hook Content: The United States has spent the last three days in mourning, but we haven\u2019t mourned alone. Across the country and around the world, people have taken to social media to express loss, confusion, disbelief -- and, somewhat unusually, wide support for the United States, after a man killed his mother on Friday and then blasted into a Connecticut school and murdered 26 other people -- 20 of them first-graders. It\u2019s a comforting indication, perhaps, that tragedy really does bring us together. While we disagree on religion and gun policy, there\u2019s a universal grief summed up in this much-shared tweet by Mexican essayist Mauricio Montiel Figueiras: \u201cI see the faces of the children who died in Sandy Hook, the smiles of all these unfulfilled promises,\u201d he wrote on Sunday. \u201cThat is the end of the world.\u201d The reflections have been particularly poignant in countries that have suffered similar acts of horror. In the United Kingdom, mentions of the 1996 Dunblane massacre are pouring in at a rate of more than 100 an hour. That shooting, also in a primary school, left 16 children and one teacher dead. Dunblane\u2019s community center posted on Facebook that it would begin a condolence book and hold a week of candlelight vigils for the Sandy Hook Elementary victims. In Australia, tweeters made frequent mention of the Port Arthur massacre that killed 35 and wounded 23 at a popular historic site in 1996. Here there\u2019s plenty of talk about gun control. Australia passed massive reforms after Port Arthur and now boasts one of the lowest gun homicide rates in the world. Some people in countries where America's public image isn't always sterling, including Afghanistan and Iraq, offered support and sympathy. \u201cPray and light candles for the angels lost in America and Syria,\u201d this tweet from Syria reads. But it\u2019s the responses from China that might be the most moving, since Henan Province just suffered its own elementary school attack. On Friday, a 36-year- old man stabbed 22 children in a primary school there, injuring two of them seriously. That\u2019s only the most recent in a string of school stabbings in China, which have killed nearly 20 children and injured more than 50. On Sina Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like network, \u201cnetizens gave an outpouring of condolences for Americans affected by the Newtown tragedy,\u201d GlobalPost reports. The hashtag \u201cHonoring Ordinary Heroes\u201d trended today with posts about Victoria Soto, the Sandy Hook teacher who died saving her students from the gunman. \u201cToday is a sad day for the entire world,\u201d one Weibo-user wrote, in a translation by GlobalPost. \u201cThey should learn from us and adopt gun control,\u201d wrote another. Calls like these are growing both inside the United States and abroad, of course -- and they\u2019ll get even louder as the gun policy debate winds up. For now, however, most of the top tweets from abroad sound a lot like these, from the Philippines and Chile. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for the children of Sandy Hook,\u201d @Detasmania tweets. \u201cHow can so much evil exist?\u201d", "Title: 11 essential facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States Content: America is a land of guns. It was true when twelve people died in Aurora, Colo., when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater. It was true when a gunman killed 27 people, including 20 children, at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn. And it remains true this morning, as police search for the gunman who is accused of killing nine people at an historic African American church in Charleston, S.C. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In this post, adapted from previous versions* that we released after mass killings in the past, we explore America's unique role among advanced countries as a place where support for guns is widespread -- and violence involving firearms is equally widespread. There are some perhaps surprising findings -- gun ownership in the United States is declining overall, for instance. But despite mass killings -- which have occurred with increasing frequency in recent years -- support for gun rights is still resolute in America. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Here are answers to a few questions you might have about guns and mass shootings, including: How common are mass shootings in this country? How many people own guns? Are mass shootings becoming more common? When were deadliest shootings in U.S. history? Is the United States an especially violent place, compared to other countries? Where is violence most common in America? Is the number of guns related to the number of homicides? Is gun control? Is there public support for gun control? What about for particular gun control policies? How do mass shootings affect public opinion on this issue? *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico ** 1\\. Shooting sprees are not rare in the United States. ** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Mother Jones tracked and mapped shooting sprees over the three decades from 1982 to May of last year. They counted \"at least 61 mass murders carried out with firearms across the country, with the killings unfolding in 30 states from Massachusetts to Hawaii,\" they found. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A Congressional Research Service report published in 2013 counted 78 incidents over roughly the same period, in which 547 were killed. Definitions of mass shootings vary. The report excludes those for whom terrorist ideology or criminal profit was a motivation. The Mother Jones staff limited themselves to indiscriminate killings of at least four people in public places by lone shooters. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Since we don't know what drove the gunman in Charleston, it's too early to speculate on how this latest incident would alter these counts. In most cases, the Mother Jones staff found, the killers had obtained their weapons legally: Since they published their analysis, five people were killed in a shooting spree in Las Vegas that authorities said was driven by anti-government views.

Gun ownership in the United States is declining overall, but nearly a third of households still have a gun.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The General Social Survey has been asking Americans about whether they have a gun in their home for decades, and last year essential tied the record low level of gun ownership reached in 2010. As you can see the chart below, 31 percent of adults reporting having a firearm in their household in 2014. That is 17 percentage points below the peak gun ownership from 1977 to 1980. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Survey data released last year by the Pew Research Center broke down the demographics of gun ownership more broadly. They wrote: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Pew found that gun ownership is concentrated among older adults, rural residents, and whites, especially white Southerners. Whites in the South are more likely to own guns than whites in other regions. ** 3\\. Active shooter events have become more common in recent years.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A report published by the FBI last year, studying active shooting situations between 2000 and 2013, found that these kinds of incidents were happening more and more recently. The first seven years of the study found an average of 6.4 active shootings per year, while the last seven years of the study found that number jumped up to 16.4 incidents per year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Active shooting incidents are defined by federal agencies as \"an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.\" (This is different from mass killings, which are episodes where three or more people are killed; while many active shooting incidents wind up being mass killings, more than half of the episodes in the FBI study did not meet that definition.) ** 4\\. Of the 12 deadliest shootings in the United States, six have happened from 2007 onward.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico As this map by The Washington Post shows, several of the deadliest shootings ever in the United States have happened in just the past few years -- including the massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. and at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg. These were the two shootings that claimed the most lives, and the third deadliest shooting was in 1991 in Killeen, Tex. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Wednesday's incident in Charleston would not be among this group of the deadliest shootings in modern American history. ** 5\\. America is an unusually violent country. But we're not as violent as we used to be.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Kieran Healy, a sociologist at Duke University, made this graph of deaths due to assault in the United States and other developed countries. We are a clear outlier -- along with Estonia and Mexico. Yet this country is a far less violent place than it was 40 years ago, with the rate of deaths due to assault declining by roughly half. As Healy writes, \"The most striking features of the data are (1) how much more violent the U.S. is than other OECD countries (except possibly Estonia and Mexico, not shown here), and (2) the degree of change\u2014and recently, decline\u2014there has been in the U.S. time series considered by itself.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico ** 6\\. The South is the most violent region in the United States.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In a subsequent post, Healy drilled further into the numbers and looked at deaths due to assault in different regions of the country. Just as the United States is a clear outlier in the international context, the South is a clear outlier in the national context: **7\\. More guns tend to mean more homicide.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Harvard Injury Control Research Center assessed the literature on guns and homicide and found that there's substantial evidence that indicates more guns means more murders.

States with stricter gun control laws have fewer deaths from gun- related violence.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In 2011, economist Richard Florida dove deep into the correlations between gun deaths and other kinds of social indicators. Some of what he found was, perhaps, unexpected: Higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental illness were not correlated with more deaths from gun violence. But one thing he found was, perhaps, perfectly predictable: States with tighter gun control laws appear to have fewer gun-related deaths. The disclaimer here is that correlation is not causation. But correlations can be suggestive: \"The map overlays the map of firearm deaths above with gun control restrictions by state,\" Florida said in 2012. \"It highlights states which have one of three gun control restrictions in place - assault weapons' bans, trigger locks, or safe storage requirements. Firearm deaths are significantly lower in states with stricter gun control legislation. Though the sample sizes are small, we find substantial negative correlations between firearm deaths and states that ban assault weapons (-.45), require trigger locks (-.42), and mandate safe storage requirements for guns (-.48).\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico ** 9\\. Gun control, in general, has not been politically popular -- and its popularity has been declining lately.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Since 1990, Gallup has been asking Americans whether they think gun control laws should be stricter. The answer, increasingly, is that they don't. \"Less than half of Americans, 47%, say they favor stricter laws covering the sale of firearms, similar to views found last year,\" Gallup says. \"But this percentage is significantly below the 58% recorded in 2012 after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, spurred a nationwide debate about the possibility of more stringent gun control laws. Thirty-eight percent of Americans say these laws should be kept as they are now, and 14% say they should be made less strict.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico ** 10\\. While general gun control isn't that popular, particular policies are.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico While many Americans strongly support the right to bear arms, they also support specific restrictions, such as background checks, assault weapons bans and a federal database to track guns.

Shootings don't tend to substantially affect views on gun control.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That is what the Pew Research Center found after polling Americans after mass shootings in the United States. In fact, Pew reported late last year that for the first in more than 20 years, Americans showed more support for gun rights than gun control.

We need to do more to prevent another Charleston. Content: June 17 was the last day of school at Sandy Hook Elementary. My Facebook news feed was filled with pictures of smiling children looking forward to the fun summer days ahead. One picture in particular made me cry. A group of boys, many of them familiar faces, had just finished third-grade. They were my son Dylan\u2019s classmates, but Dylan wasn\u2019t in the picture. Dylan was killed in his first grade classroom on Dec. 14, 2012, alongside 19 other first graders and six educators. While I continue to be grateful for the children and adults who survived that day, sadness and anger overcome me each time I see pictures like these. Dylan should be there, too. Schools should be safe places. That night, my news feed filled with another tragedy. Nine worshipers were killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. My heart breaks for the victims, their families and their community. Sympathy, compassion and love are fundamentally required. But broken hearts do not make change. While the motives for this hate crime may be very different from the crime that took my son from me, there are similarities. Access to firearms. Mental health issues. Ignored signs that violence was imminent. And the destruction of yet another seemingly safe place. Are we honestly surprised? Every year in the U.S., 500,000 acts of gun violence are committed \u2014 including homicide, suicide and injury. Almost 90 people dying every day. Are there any safe places left in America? When did we become a country that accepts this level of daily violence? How many times can we watch the news filled with these preventable horrors and then look away to get on with our own lives, all the while hoping that the next news story isn\u2019t about our town? How much longer are we going to incorrectly believe that we cannot do anything about gun violence? We must reject the narrative that it is hopeless and we are helpless. These acts of violence are preventable and there are actions we can all take in our own homes and community to make a difference. In 70 percent of all gun violence acts (including suicides), at least one other person was told an act of violence would be committed. We need to educate ourselves, and our children about the warning signs. And we need to train ourselves to reach out to trusted adults when we hear or see threats. No person should be afraid to go to church, school, a movie theater, a grocery store or just walk down the street and wonder if they might not ever go home again. I refuse to accept that our public spaces are dangerous. I refuse to teach my surviving son to live his life in fear of other people. We are not an unsafe country. But we are failing as a society to look after each other, intervene and get people help. We are failing to deal with the toxic combination that we see in acts of violence. Sometimes it\u2019s irrational fear, hatred and racism. But for many Americans who lack the skills to cope with stress and anger, or for the very few with severe mental illness, easy access to a firearm leads to tragic loss.

On Thursday, the United Nations reported seven new alleged victims as it responded to a Human Rights Watch report about the scandal that was released the same day. The victims were as young as 14, according to the report, which said several were raped. As in several previous cases, the abuses reportedly occurred in one of the country\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable communities: a camp for families displaced by the country\u2019s civil war, now entering its fourth year. The top U.N. official in the Central African Republic, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, called the alleged \u00adabuses \u201ca double crime that affects the vulnerable women and children you were sent here to protect.\u201d Onanga-Anyanga announced that he would dismiss a contingent of 120 troops from Congo Republic, also known as Congo-Brazzaville, whose members were allegedly responsible for some of the most recent abuses. The troops will be confined to their barracks until they depart the country. Since the U.N. mission in the Central African Republic was launched in 2014, it has been plagued by dozens of reports of sexual violence. There have been allegations of more than 40 cases\u00ad of sexual abuse perpetrated by U.N. employees in the country in the past 13 months alone, according to U.N. data. In an interview, Onanga-Anyanga said more cases\u00ad were likely to be uncovered as U.N. investigators continue their work. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we might just be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. The women and girls interviewed by Human Rights Watch said the peacekeepers responsible were from Congo Republic and Congo, the separate country formerly known as Zaire. Several victims said that the level of desperation in the displacement camps had led them to exchange sex for food or money. Others said they were raped at gunpoint. The alleged abuses\u00ad occurred in the town of Bambari, in the center of the country, from this past October to December. \u201cIn a country where armed groups routinely prey on civilians, peacekeepers should be protectors, not predators,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, a women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe men were dressed in their military uniforms and had their guns,\u201d one 14-year-old victim told Human Rights Watch. \u201cI walked by and suddenly one of them grabbed me by my arms and the other one ripped off my clothes. They pulled me into the tall grass, and one held my arms while the other one pinned down my legs and raped me.\u201d At least some of the troops accused of the recent abuses\u00ad had received U.N.-mandated training on sexual-abuse-related issues before their deployment \u2014 part of the organization\u2019s attempt to curb the problem. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon recently called such abuses\u00ad \u201ca cancer in our system.\u201d In January, The Washington Post reported that four peacekeepers had allegedly paid girls as young as 13 as little as 50 cents in exchange for sex in a different camp for the internally displaced in Central African Republic. Last week, the United Nations announced that European troops had raped two girls and paid two others for sex \u2014 all four of them ages 14 to 16. The series of abuses\u00ad allegedly carried out by international troops began in 2013 and early 2014, when as many as 14 troops from France, Chad and Equatorial Guinea allegedly raped and sodomized six boys ages 9 to 15. Now, U.N. officials face the challenge of mediating a vicious civil war while also policing their own ranks. The mission includes about 11,000 peacekeepers and costs about $600 million per year. \u201cWe are conducting patrols on our own people, which has never been done before,\u201d said a senior U.N. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal security measures. One of the problems, the official said, is that the U.N. mission had been accepting troops from the African Union who either were not aware of or were not concerned about U.N. values. \u201cYou can\u2019t just take African Union troops, put a blue helmet on them and assume their mind-set will change overnight,\u201d he said, referring to the color of U.N. peacekeepers\u2019 helmets. Last year, a U.N. report by a panel that included former Canadian Supreme Court justice Marie Deschamps said that U.N. staff in Bangui, the Central African Republic\u2019s capital, had \u201cturned a blind eye to the criminal actions of individual troops.\u201d The previous U.N. special representative there, retired Gen. Babacar Gaye of Senegal, was fired in August over his team\u2019s handling of the abuse allegations. **Read more** The hospital at the center of a Muslim-Christian war in Africa Christian-Muslim marriages are the latest casualty of strife in Central African Republic The Central African Republic\u2019s complex war, explained in the journey of a Muslim baby", "Title: The U.N. faces intense scrutiny in South Sudan after failing to stop a brutal attack on foreign aid workers Content: When a spasm of violence broke out in South Sudan's capital last month, a group of foreign aid workers faced a fateful decision: Should they try to flee the country or go into lockdown? The consensus they reached was that it was too dangerous to leave their compound, known as Terrain. \"There was a lot of gunfire nearby,\" said Gian Libot, a Philippine aid worker. \"But it wasn't directed at us. We were under the impression that we weren't the target of any of the fighting.\" After two days cooped up in Terrain's safehouse, that impression was shattered when gunfire erupted at the gate of the compound. The mood among the dozens of foreigners and South Sudanese inside went from confusion to concern to panic in minutes. Seeking protection, they frantically called contacts at embassies and the U.N. peacekeeping mission, which happened to be just down the road. When Libot was finally discovered, he was hit with a rifle butt on his back and was ushered into a hallway, where a soldier told the group that he would kill them as a warning to foreigners, particularly Americans, to stop meddling in his country. Instead, the soldiers shot John Gatluak, a South Sudanese journalist working for a nongovernmental organization focused on media development. \"They singled him out because he was Nuer,\" said Libot, referring to Gatluak's ethnicity. The attack at Terrain is the latest in the seemingly endless stream of horrors befalling civilians in South Sudan. And as with several cases in the past, this one has left many asking: Where was the U.N. peacekeeping force that had been called multiple times for help? Given that it has a mandate to protect civilians and to use force if necessary, how did a brazen assault go on for hours so close to the peacekeepers' base? On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced that his office would be asking the same question. In a statement, he said he was \"alarmed\" at the attack on Terrain and concerned that the U.N. mission there, known by the acronym UNMISS, \"did not respond appropriately to prevent this and other grave cases of sexual violence committed in Juba,\" South Sudan's capital. His office will open an \"independent special investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding these incidents and to evaluate the Mission\u2019s overall response.\" On Feb. 17, fighters with AK-47s and grenade launchers broke into a camp for displaced people in the northern town of Malakal. As many as 50 civilians were fatally shot, burned alive in their tents or crushed to death by panicking crowds. U.N. peacekeepers fled their posts. A summary of the UNMISS \u201cboard of inquiry report\u201d said the organization and its peacekeepers failed through a \u201ccombination of inaction, abandonment of post and refusal to engage.\u201d Some peacekeepers reportedly demanded written permission to use their weapons, even though their U.N. mandate clearly gives them that authority. Perhaps more important, peacekeepers did not heed warnings that violence was brewing and were not prepared to act, the report said. This lack of foresight and risk management seems to have been repeated in Juba during the Terrain attack. To be fair, U.N. peacekeepers are facing an almost impossible task in South Sudan. In the civil war there, neither side has shown much regard for the safety of civilians. More than 160,000 civilians live in U.N. camps for the internally displaced. Those camps are routinely raided, often by government-backed troops. It is rare for U.N. peacekeepers to be tasked with protecting civilians against their own government's troops. If anything, UNMISS failed to recognize that Terrain might be a target. The aid workers there didn't think they would be targeted, either. But what they and the private security contractors hired by their aid organizations may not have realized is that renegade factions of South Sudan's army harbored violent resentment toward foreigners operating in the country. Salva Kiir, South Sudan's president and leader of its army, acknowledged that not all of his soldiers were \"completely subordinate to the authority of a civilian government.\" A State Department official said it was likely that troops not under Kiir's control were responsible for the attack at Terrain, adding that it was conceivable that members of South Sudan's National Security Service \u2014 its intelligence organization \u2014 also took part. Aid workers recounted that almost all the attackers at Terrain were in army uniforms and that some had insignia worn by Kiir's personal guard. More damning, however, is a timeline of events compiled by the U.N. Joint Operations Center and obtained by the AP. The timeline details multiple units of peacekeepers refusing to be deployed to Terrain despite repeated calls for help. Ultimately, it was not until about four hours after UNMISS was notified of the attack that South Sudanese troops under Kiir's control entered Terrain and rescued most of those inside. The U.S. Embassy was instrumental in spurring South Sudan's army to send those troops, even if they were not able to reach the compound before many atrocities had been committed. When Molly Phee, the U.S. ambassador to South Sudan, was informed of the attack, she contacted the National Security Service and Kiir's presidential guard. \"Some of the security forces had lost control over some of their men. Those who remained under control of the generals were who we called upon for assistance,\" Phee said on the phone from Juba. \"Generals had to find trusted troops. Then those troops had to make their way through the fighting.\" The U.S. Agency for International Development, which partners with and funds the nongovernmental organization for which Gatluak and others at Terrain worked, said it was \"reviewing the incident to determine how we can further support the security of our partners.\" The organization said that its partners are required to have security plans in place as \"part of their award\" and that USAID project funding goes toward security.

Investigators discovered this month that at least four U.N. peacekeepers in the Central African Republic allegedly paid girls as little as 50 cents in exchange for sex. The case is the latest to plague the U.N. mission in the Central African Republic, whose employees have been accused of 22 other incidents of alleged sexual abuse or sexual exploitation in the past 14 months. The most recent accusations come in the wake of Ban\u2019s efforts to implement a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for such offenses. The United Nations maintains nine peacekeeping operations in Africa, employing more than 100,000 people on the continent, and the abuses threaten to erode the organization\u2019s legitimacy. Other sex-crime cases have occurred in Mali, South Sudan, Liberia and Congo in recent years. Last month, the United Nations published a damning independent investigation that said that poor enforcement of policies in place to deter and report abuse meant that \u201cthe credibility of the U.N. and peacekeeping operations are in jeopardy.\u201d Experts and officials say systemic problems still hinder the investigation and prosecution of alleged abusers, leading to a perception of impunity. The abuse \u201cundermines everything we stand for,\u201d said Anthony Banbury, the U.N. assistant secretary general for field support. The mission in the Central African Republic, where U.N. troops and civilians were sent in 2014 to help end a civil war and support a fledgling government, stands out for its record of sexual abuse and exploitation. \u201cThey are preying on the people they\u2019ve come to protect,\u201d said Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, the top U.N. official in the country. The most recent allegations involve at least four peacekeepers who are accused of paying girls as young as 13 for sex at a camp for the internally displaced next to the international airport in Bangui, the capital. The site, known as M\u2019poko camp, is home to 20,000 people, mostly Christians. It is a vast agglomeration of white tents surrounding old, decaying airplanes, just yards from the airport runway. The United Nations has not publicly released the nationalities of the accused troops or provided details of the alleged abuse. But in interviews, U.N. officials said the peacekeepers were from Gabon, Morocco, Burundi and France. The prostitution ring they allegedly used was run by boys and young men who offered girls \u201cfor anywhere from 50 cents to three dollars,\u201d according to one official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Some officials say there may be many more cases of exploitation by peacekeepers that have gone unreported. Because there is no regular U.N. presence in M\u2019poko, it has been difficult to gauge the scale of the problem. M\u2019poko had already had a problem with sexual abuse before the recent cases were reported. Its population had grown sharply since September, when violence erupted between the warring \u00adparties in the Central African Republic. Human Rights Watch documented nine cases of sexual violence between September and December in and around the displacement camp. In several instances, Christian women were raped by members of the mostly Christian \u201canti-balaka\u201d militia after being accused of interacting with Muslims. Across Bangui, the conflict has fallen largely along religious lines. \u201cM\u2019poko is a lawless zone run by anti-balaka thugs a few hundred meters away from the international airport. The camp is not being protected, and women are being raped,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, a Human Rights Watch researcher focused on the Central African Republic. But this marks the first time that the United Nations has acknowledged the involvement of its employees in the camp\u2019s underworld of commercial sex work, which is driven by abject poverty and a lack of law enforcement. \u201cThe M\u2019poko camp is unfortunately a place where horrible, unacceptable things happen to women and children,\u201d said Banbury, the assistant secretary general. \u201cIn some cases, we have credible allegations that there are U.N. personnel that have committed these crimes.\u201d Banbury said U.N. troops plan to begin patrolling M\u2019poko more frequently and will attempt to dismantle the prostitution ring. The U.N. mission in the Central African Republic has been plagued by sexual abuse allegations. The previous U.N. special representative there, retired Senegalese general Babacar Gaye, was fired in August over his team\u2019s handling of the accusations. The organization has dispatched special investigators to Bangui to better understand what has gone wrong. The United Nations was also strongly criticized for failing to react to offenses by peacekeepers in the country. As many as 14 troops from France, Chad and Equatorial Guinea allegedly raped and sodomized six boys between the ages of 9 and 15 in 2013 and 2014, before the U.N. mission formally began. The United Nations took no action after learning about the cases until a whistleblower leaked an internal U.N. investigation to French authorities, according to U.N. officials. Last month, the report by a panel including former Canadian Supreme Court justice Marie Deschamps found that U.N. staff in Bangui had \u201cturned a blind eye to the criminal actions of individual troops\u201d in that case. In August, two women and one girl accused three U.N. peacekeepers of rape in the war-torn town of Bambari. That same month, a U.N. police officer allegedly raped a 12-year-old girl during an operation in Bangui\u2019s main Muslim neighborhood. She had been hiding in a bathroom while peacekeepers searched her house, according to Amnesty International. \u201cWhen I cried, he slapped me hard and put his hand over my mouth,\u201d the girl told an Amnesty International researcher. For years, the United Nations has been trying to stop the sexual abuse perpetrated by its employees and troops under its command. It has ordered a series of reports to identify weaknesses in enforcement and mandated that a component on sexual exploitation and abuse be included in training for peacekeepers. Ban has also encouraged harsher penalties for the peacekeeping units to which the abusers belong. But the slow pace of investigations into abuse has \u201cseverely undermined enforcement,\u201d according to a report last year from the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services. Even more problematic, some experts say, is that the prosecution of alleged offenders falls to the governments of the countries that provide the peacekeepers. In many cases, those governments conduct halfhearted investigations and fail to convict offenders. \u201cTo say that it is immensely frustrating is a tremendous understatement,\u201d said Banbury. \u201cThe U.N. should stop tiptoeing around, trying not to offend governments, and instead put the victims of sexual exploitation and abuse at the heart of their policy,\u201d said Sarah Taylor, an advocate in the women\u2019s rights division at Human Rights Watch. Some argue that the lack of enforcement encourages a sense among U.N. employees that they can commit sexual crimes with impunity while based overseas. \u201cThey think \u2018We\u2019re in a special class,\u2019 that sexual abuse is not that serious,\u201d said Paula Donovan, who leads Code Blue, an advocacy campaign working to expose the issue of sexual abuse by U.N. personnel. The number of alleged cases of sexual exploitation and abuse committed by U.N. personnel declined from 2008 to 2014, dropping from 83 to 51, which U.N. officials say is evidence of increasingly effective intervention. But critics say that those numbers are incomplete and that many cases go unreported. \u201cThe data is not just porous. It\u2019s a joke,\u201d Donovan said. Other analysts say that getting civilians to report sexual crimes in war-torn environments, where there is a mistrust of authority and a lack of law enforcement, is an enormous challenge. The victims might \u201cfear retaliation by the perpetrator, who in some cases carries a weapon,\u201d said a report last year on U.N. abuses by the Stimson Center, a Washington-based research organization. In many other cases, impoverished girls and women accept food and money in exchange for sex. \u201cThis is already a society whose social fabric has totally collapsed, with youngsters left to fend for themselves,\u201d said \u00adOnanga-Anyanga. \u201cThis is putting salt into an open wound.\u201d _**Correction:** An earlier version of this article had an incorrect name for the organization that published a report last year on U.N. abuses. The Stimson Center came out with the report._ **Read more** Pope Francis visits mosque in war-torn Central African Republic Tens of thousands of Muslims flee Christian militias in Central African Republic Christian-Muslim marriages are latest casualty of strife in Central African Republic", "Title: The growing U.N. scandal over sex abuse and \u2018peacekeeper babies\u2019 Content: BANGUI, Central African Republic \u2014 The neighborhood is a patchwork of low- slung buildings scorched and looted at the height of the civil war, a place where the United Nations was supposed to come to the rescue. But in a number of homes, women and girls are raising babies they say are the children of U.N. troops who abused or exploited them. \u201cPeacekeeper babies,\u201d the United Nations calls such infants. \u201cA horrible thing,\u201d says an elfin 14-year-old girl, who describes how a Burundian soldier dragged her into his barracks and raped her, leaving her pregnant with the baby boy she now cradles uncomfortably. The allegations come amid one of the biggest scandals to plague the United Nations in years. Since the U.N. peacekeeping mission here began in 2014, its employees have been formally accused of sexually abusing or exploiting 42 local civilians, most of them underage girls. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called sexual abuse by peacekeepers \u201ca cancer in our system.\u201d In August, the top U.N. official here was fired for failing to take enough action on abuse cases. Nearly 1,000 troops whose units have been tied to abuses have been expelled, or will be soon. Among them is the entire contingent from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But the victims appear to be more numerous than the United Nations has reported so far. In a corner of the capital city known as Castors, near the U.N. headquarters in the country, The Washington Post interviewed seven women and girls who described contact with peacekeepers that violated U.N. regulations against sexual exploitation and abuse. Five of them said they exchanged sex for food or money \u2014 sometimes as little as $4 \u2014 while their country was rocked by civil war and families were going hungry. Only two had reported their cases to the United Nations. Five of the seven interviewed by The Post said they had borne the children of their abusers. The 14-year-old mother said she was assaulted by a Burundian soldier, but the United Nations recorded her case not as rape but as \u201ctransactional\u201d sex, in which acts are exchanged for money or food. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m alone with my baby, I think about killing him,\u201d the teen said, holding the little boy. \u201cHe reminds me of the man who raped me.\u201d The accounts by the women and girls could not be independently verified. But their stories are consistent with other accounts of abuse in the Central African Republic collected by independent groups and the United Nations. The Post does not identify minors who are alleged victims of sexual abuse or exploitation. The U.N. system responsible for handling and prosecuting such cases has been widely criticized as dysfunctional, even after scandals involving peacekeepers in other parts of the world. Only one criminal charge has been filed in relation to any of the 42 cases of sexual abuse or exploitation that have been officially registered in the Central African Republic, according to U.N. officials. U.N. officials did file a report on the 14-year-old mother\u2019s **** case, and a U.N. spokeswoman, Ismini Palla, said the organization was \u201cmonitoring the case of the girl closely.\u201d But nine months after the girl reported the alleged rape, investigators have not reported any results. U.N. officials had no comment on why they had classified the case as exploitation rather than assault. The sexual abuse scandal is the latest horrific development in a war already marked by extreme brutality. The conflict began in late 2013 when mostly Muslim rebels overthrew the government in this Christian-majority country, setting off a cycle of revenge killings that in Bangui fell largely along religious lines. About 6,000 people have been killed. The U.N. mission, a 12,000-member organization that includes troops from 46 countries and is known as MINUSCA, was established to provide security and protect civilians. In recent months, numerous allegations have emerged of peacekeeper abuse of vulnerable residents. Human Rights Watch issued a report this month documenting the cases of eight women and girls allegedly raped or sexually exploited by U.N. peacekeepers in late 2015 in the central city of Bambari. Amnesty International said last August that it had obtained evidence of a U.N. peacekeeper\u2019s rape of a 12-year-old girl in the capital. U.N. officials recognize that they are grappling with a serious breakdown in their peacekeeping forces. This month, they said they were investigating the cases of four girls who were allegedly exploited or abused at a camp for internally displaced persons in central Ouaka prefecture. In January, they said that at least four peacekeepers had allegedly paid girls as little as 50 cents for sex at a camp in Bangui. Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, the newly appointed head of the U.N. mission, said he fears that the cases discovered so far may be the \u201ctip of the iceberg.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to be flooded by paternity claims,\u201d he said in an interview. It is not the first deployment in which U.N. forces have been accused of sexual abuse. In Bosnia in the 1990s, peacekeepers were accused of soliciting sex from women who had been trafficked and virtually enslaved in local brothels. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the early 2000s, more than 150 allegations of abuse and exploitation were registered against peacekeepers, and U.N. investigators found that many of the alleged victims were orphans. U.N. missions in Kosovo, Haiti, Liberia and other places also have been tarnished by such allegations. The United Nations has conducted internal investigations and revamped training programs. But the complaints continue to roll in. Perhaps no mission in recent U.N. history has been as quickly tainted by abuse allegations as the one in the Central African Republic, which is expected to cost $814 million this year. The first cluster of sexual abuse cases appeared within months of the mission\u2019s September 2014 launch. Even before the U.N. mission officially began, French troops were accused of sexually abusing a number of local children. In a report issued last year, a United Nations-appointed review panel sharply criticized U.N. officials in the Central African Republic as failing to take action or report the cases after uncovering them. \u201cThe welfare of the victims and the accountability of the perpetrators appeared to be an afterthought, if considered at all,\u201d the report said. U.N. bases in the Central African Republic are now plastered with posters that list the rules that troops are already supposed to know. \u201cSex with anyone under the age of 18 is prohibited.\u201d \u201cExchanging money, goods or employment for sex is prohibited.\u201d \u201cZero tolerance for sexual exploitation.\u201d But the Castors neighborhood is a shocking illustration of how brazen the peacekeepers became. Residents say that troops skulked around the neighborhood looking for girls during the day and sneaked out at night to meet them in rented rooms or abandoned houses, or to take them into the barracks. Moroccan troops broke holes in the perimeter wall of their bases, witnesses said, so that they could leave undetected. \u201cThere are so many girls here who slept with [peacekeepers],\u201d said Thierry Karpandgei, a resident. \u201cYou can see their babies all over here.\u201d Most of the alleged cases of abuse and exploitation occurred at the peak of the conflict, in 2014 and 2015, when the fighting pushed residents to the edge of survival. \u201cThere was no way to get food or money at the time, and they promised to help us if we slept with them,\u201d said Rosine Mengue, who explained that she received the equivalent of $4 in each of two encounters with a peacekeeper. She was 16 at the time. She spent the money on cassava leaves, which fed her family for two days. Mengue, who is now 18, told The Washington Post it could use her full name. Like the rest of the women, Mengue never heard from the man after she became pregnant, she said. He went back to Morocco. She dropped out of school and is raising her son in her family\u2019s home, surrounded by charred palm trees and the ruins of half-destroyed buildings. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough food for everyone,\u201d her mother said. U.N. officials have said that peacekeeping contingents from about 10 countries have been implicated in the sex-abuse scandal. Most of the women interviewed by The Post said they did not report their cases to the United Nations because they felt ashamed and did not think the organization would be able to help them. One of the women did approach the United Nations seeking financial assistance for her baby after his father returned to the Congo Republic. But U.N. officials say she did not specify that she had received money from the peacekeeper \u2014 as she later told The Post \u2014 so the case was not recorded as involving exploitation. Such an act would have violated U.N. rules for peacekeepers on sexual relationships. Castors is along the road from the sprawling U.N. headquarters, where Onanga- Anyanga, 55, a veteran U.N. official from Gabon, is scrambling to solve the problem. In an interview this month, he sat in front of a sheet of paper that said in bold print: \u201cTalking points \u2014 Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.\u201d When he looked up, he spoke angrily. \u201cWe inherited troops that we cannot call troops. I realized that what was sent here was trash,\u201d he said. There are a range of explanations for the rampant abuse, including the poor training and discipline of many battalions, which are dispatched here for years-long rotations, said U.N. officials and analysts. Some troops were sent in 2013 as part of an African Union operation and then were \u201cre-hatted\u201d as U.N. peacekeepers with little or no additional instruction. \u201cWe can\u2019t just put a blue helmet on them and assume their mind-set will change overnight,\u201d Onanga-Anyanga said. U.N. officials here have tried to encourage the reporting of sexual abuse by setting up a hotline for victims and buying radio ads in which they are encouraged to come forward. Victims of abuse whose cases are documented are eligible for medical and psychological help and possibly other assistance. But many women are still unaware of how to register complaints. Even as the United Nations has tried to improve training on sexual abuse, there have been mistakes. Many of the new lessons, for example, are taught only in English and French, and some troops lack fluency in either language, said one U.N. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the issue. Perhaps most problematic is that the United Nations leaves the adjudication of sexual abuse allegations to the troops\u2019 countries of origin. But those nations\u2019 investigations are often weak, U.N. officials said. That has contributed to a sense of impunity, according to U.N. officials and outside experts. For peacekeepers in the Central African Republic, \u201cthe message is clear: You can rape or abuse women and girls, and you can get away with it,\u201d said Lewis Mudge, an Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cUntil troop-contributing countries bring peacekeepers accused of these crimes to justice, we can expect more of these cases in the future.\u201d The 14-year-old mother still watches the troops drive near her faded-yellow home, where broken beer bottles are glued on top of the outside wall to keep trespassers out. She and other residents said they first saw the peacekeepers as a sign of security, proof that the world hadn\u2019t forgotten about them. But when the soldiers began arriving in 2014, there was still a massive food shortage. Some peacekeepers recognized their leverage over a city of starving women and girls. Two teenage girls recalled approaching a base of Moroccan peacekeepers to beg for food. Neither had ever had sex, they said in a recent interview, but they agreed to sleep with the soldiers after the men suggested they would give the girls water, food and money. The older girl, then 16, said she met one man in a vacant house. The younger girl, then 15, said she met another soldier next to a base. Both girls said they regretted what they had done almost immediately. \u201cYou just feel used,\u201d said the younger girl. The 14-year-old said that when she went to a U.N. base last year to ask for food, a Burundian soldier gently beckoned to her from his barracks, calling, \u201cCome here.\u201d Then, she said, he pulled her into a room full of empty beds. He ripped off her clothes. The teenager and her aunt said that three months later, they told two U.N. employees what had happened. The pregnant girl was then taken to a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, the medical group said. But aid workers who followed the girl\u2019s case over the next few weeks said they were dismayed at how little help she received from the United Nations. \u201cThere was absolutely no immediate or concrete measure of assistance available to this girl,\u201d said Ondine Ripka, an international legal adviser with Doctors Without Borders. A UNICEF spokesman, John Budd, said the organization does not comment on aid provided to individuals. The 14-year-old mother said she had not received any psychological counseling or financial assistance. In a 2005 internal report recognizing the problem of \u201cpeacekeeper babies,\u201d U.N. officials wrote that \u201cthere is a need to try to ensure that fathers, who can be identified, perhaps through blood or DNA testing, bear some financial responsibility for their actions.\u201d But it is often difficult to identify offenders who have returned to their home countries, U.N. officials say. Even if victims know the names of their abusers, armies in many nations have proved uncooperative in pursuing DNA tests, U.N. officials say. The teenage mother\u2019s case was referred to the Burundian military, which appointed an investigator, according to U.N. officials, but no results have so far been reported. That country has been consumed in civil strife in recent months, and experts said it was unlikely the military would follow through on an investigation. That leaves girls like the 14-year-old to raise their babies on almost nothing, as the war rages on. Earlier this month, she sat outside her home, five rooms where more than 20 relatives sleep. Nearby, a man sold liquor from a plastic table. A white U.N. surveillance blimp flew overhead. Two hundred yards away, a group of Burundian troops was on patrol. The teenager handed her baby to her mother, who looked at the ground. She fears that her daughter has been ruined by the abuse. \u201cIf someone destroys what you love, what do you do?\u201d the mother said.

Getting to co-author a scientific paper isn't usually part of the deal. But Grant Adams will always have a little something extra to remember his travels: the discovery of a lizard previously unknown to science. _Euspondylus paxcorpus_ was formally described in a recent paper in Zootaxa, but its story began in 2011. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Adams, who had recently graduated from Denison University with a degree in biology, was just hoping to find some scientific task to keep his resume up to date. He sent an e-mail to a mailing list for ecologists, offering to collect data for them during his two-year stint in the Andes. [ _Seven new species of miniature frogs discovered (and they\u2019re adorable)_] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"My thing was plants,\" Adams told The Post. But no botanists were biting. Instead, he heard back from Tiffany Doan, a biologist from the University of Central Florida. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And Doan wanted reptiles. \"I had no interest in lizards or snakes at all, but it sounded like something fun I could do,\" Adams said. All Doan asked was that he keep an eye out for any creepy crawlers and send her pictures. If anything looked unfamiliar, she'd sound the alarm and they could start collecting them for further study. Before long, they had their lizard: a species Doan had never seen before. In the Andes, they were so ubiquitous that Adams found several of them while out farming potatoes with his host family \u2014 all of whom were more than familiar with the creatures. But it became obvious that the lizard had never been formally described. But there was a problem. By the time Adams and Doan were able to get permits to collect the lizards \u2014 a necessary step to having them classified as a whole new species \u2014 Adams only had one week left in the town. On the one hand, he was excited to get to his new post, where he'd be assisting researchers at the Peruvian Marine Institute. On the other, he had an obligation to help catalogue one strange little lizard. \"I was still finishing up some projects, so I didn\u2019t have a lot of time,\" Adams said. \"So I enlisted my community to help me collect the things. I put out some posters and asked my students, and in a week I had a whole bunch of them.\" Adams admits he had to resort to bribery to get some community members on board: He tried to tempt them with chocolate candies but ultimately paid about a dollar a lizard out of his own pocket. \"That, uh, kind of hurt my living budget a little,\" he mused. [ _A new species of giant tortoise was just discovered in the Galapagos_] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But lots of his younger students were happy enough to do it for the thrill of the hunt. One particular group of boys banded together to search all over the place. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In his \"little dirt house,\" Adams set about euthanizing and preserving the lizards to send them off to Doan and researchers at local universities. The small brown lizards are \u2014 well, they look like small brown lizards. And in the community where Adams was living, they were nothing special. They were just _the lizards_. People mostly knew them as an ingredient in a folk remedy. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"They'll splay the lizard and tie it to the injured area to help heal it,\" Adams said. \"Actually, during the project, my host sister got hurt, and my host mother wanted one of my lizards to help her heal.\" Doan's studies formalized the lizard in the literature, and pointed out one potentially important feature: Although the lizards have complex spots and coloring variations (variations on brown, anyway) in life, they lose all of those variations once they're preserved, turning a uniform dark brown. If someone had simply put a lizard into storage for later study, it could have led to an incorrect description of the species. But since Adams was there to document the living lizards, science can record the reptiles in living color. These days Adams is at the University of Southern Mississippi. His run-in with _Euspondylus paxcorpus_ may not have awakened a love of herpetology in him, but his Peace Corps assignment doing marine research proved to be a better fit \u2014 he now studies marine biology. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"It's going to be one of those lifelong stories, discovering a species,\" Adams said. \"I'll always carry that with me.\" And hey, he added: As a young scientist, it's always great to get your name on a publication. **Read More:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Farmer digs up woolly mammoth bones in Michigan soy field *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico More than 200 new species found in Eastern Himalayas, including a \u2018walking\u2019 fish *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico These newly discovered marsupials basically sex each other to death *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Seven new species of miniature frogs discovered (and they\u2019re adorable) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico New species alert: There are dwarf dragons in the Andes *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Scientists try to save the frogs as time runs out Content: EL VALLE, Panama \u2014 In moist, mossy rooms, rows of glass aquariums bathed in eerie light shelter the last of the last of the frogs. It is a secure facility, for here reside the sole survivors of their species, rescued from the wild before a modern plague swept through their forests and streams in a ferocious doomsday event that threatens the planet\u2019s amphibians with extinction. The lab smells like a junior-high locker room where the bleach is losing. Perhaps it is all the crickets, larvae, flies \u2014 the food that is keeping the frogs alive. They are safe, at least for now, in what scientists are calling an \u201camphibian ark.\u201d But time is running out. The frogs have been captives for five or six years, and frogs do not live forever. The caretakers hope they will be able to encourage these finicky, exotic, mysterious captives to breed, and then return their progeny \u2014 somehow, someday, somewhere \u2014 to the wild. It is much harder than you might think. Because the thing that is killing the frogs is still out there. In what may be the greatest disease-driven loss of biodiversity in recorded history, hundreds of frog species around the world are facing extinction. Far from being obscure, many of the frogs threatened at the checkout counter are Class A Number One amphibians \u2014 the kinds of jewel-colored frogs that adorn postage stamps and Smithsonian calendars and that biologists consider to be keystone species in their environments, no less important than otters or coral or bees, in their way. Frogs in the western United States are threatened, and Australia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean have been especially hard hit. Central American countries such as Panama are suffering a catastrophic decline. The villain is a rather extraordinary fungus, an amphibian version of a case of athlete\u2019s foot from hell, with an impossible name, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which scientists call \u201cBd,\u201d a virulent, lethal fungus that has spread around the globe. It is like a cheesy horror movie, but real. The little victims? Their pores clog, and they die of a heart attack. In the pristine tropical forests of the world, the waters still run clear and clean, and the jungle is, as ever, a riot of green, grasping life. But something is missing. Where there was once a crazy cacophony of frog song, all day, all night, there is now a spooky quiet. The streams have gone silent. The frogs are gone. And they might not be coming back, unless scientists in extinction hot spots such as Panama succeed in their audacious bid to breed the rarest of the rare in captivity in amphibian arks. In Panama, scientists are returning to sites where just a few years ago they observed frogs in abundance. They are searching for survivors. They are not finding many. \u201cThis sure is depressing,\u201d said Cori Richards-Zawacki, a professor from Tulane University who has logged months in the field here. In rubber boots, carrying a backpack filled with gear to weigh, measure and swab for fungal infection any frog she finds, Richards-Zawacki slogged a few hundred meters down a narrow gorge of the Rio Farallon, peering at the banks covered in moss and fern, water dripping from springs and waterfalls. It should have been a hopping place. The last time Richards-Zawacki was in this spot, in 2004, she remembers counting 15 golden frogs in two hours, and a number of other diurnal species. Because Panamanian golden frogs are known as \u201cexplosive breeders,\u201d a few times a year one could see them congregate by the hundreds at water\u2019s edge to copulate. Today? \u201cNada. Zero. None,\u201d she said. Scientists calculate that more than a third, and as much as two-thirds, of all frog species in Latin America are at risk. In Panama, famous for its biological diversity, the country\u2019s mascot, the golden frog, has not been seen in the wild since 2008. Scientists began to document a worldwide decline of amphibians in the 1980s. Many were victims of habitat change, introduced predators, pollution, pesticides or over-harvesting by collectors. Yet frogs vanished from pristine habitats like those in Panama, where the trees still harbor howler monkeys and pygmy sloths. The contributing causes may include climate change and increased ultraviolet radiation, but one thing is certain: The Bd fungus is wiping out frogs. \u201cUsually when Bd appears, it kills everything it is going to kill, and quickly,\u201d said Roberto Ibanez of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. \u201cIt kills some species, infects others, who serve as disease vectors, as carriers, so it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Ibanez said the spread of the fungus may have been helped, like other emerging diseases, such as swine flu and AIDS, by globalization. The fungus may have been spread by the international trade in African clawed frogs, a popular laboratory animal and pet, which was used for pregnancy tests (urine from pregnant women would induce the frog to produce eggs). The clawed frog carries the fungus but does not get sick. The same is true of American bullfrogs. Studies published in recent months suggest the Bd fungus itself might be evolving, creating a more deadly \u201csuperbug.\u201d Researchers have also found that the more variable the temperature, attributed to climate change, the more lethal the fungus. In a pretty resort town nestled in the bottom of a volcanic caldera is El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center, known as EVACC, the original Amphibian Ark, supported by the Houston Zoo. \u201cWe knew the fungus would be here, we saw it coming, and we knew we had to do something,\u201d said Edgardo Griffith, a founder of the center, who sports a tattoo of a golden frog on his calf. In 2006 and 2007, Griffith and his team rushed to collect hundreds of frogs, representing a dozen species. In the beginning, they rented two rooms at the Hotel Campestre, where they would rinse the frogs in an antifungal bath, day after day. They kept the survivors in the quarantine room before they could be moved to the clean room. \u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d Griffith said. The fungus was already taking its toll. \u201cI saw frogs dying as we were collecting them. They would die in your hand,\u201d Griffith said. \u201cThe only option we had was to buy some time, keep them alive.\u201d This is actually the way things are going these days in conservation biology. Some of the most glamorous animals \u2014 golden lion tamarinds, red wolves, Siberian tigers \u2014 are rebounding from extinction, but many more species are slowly, inexorably being snuffed out. Scientists aren\u2019t sure how long some frog species live, in the wild or captivity, so they are not sure how much time they have. Before they can reintroduce frogs to their home streams, they want to have at least 400 or 500 healthy individuals, for insurance. For some frog species, they have only a couple of males and females left. Frogs are sensitive creatures. They drink and respire through their skin. They need just the right amount of ultraviolet light. If they don\u2019t get enough vitamin B, they fail to thrive. If they don\u2019t get enough calcium, their legs break. Some frogs prefer fast-moving water, others slow. So the staff turns on and off cloud machines, humidifiers, and shower heads that mimic rainfall. Three staff members are working 24/7. Certain frogs fight in their tanks. They punch each other. The staff finds high levels of stress hormones in their feces, and yes \u2014 someone is checking. Encouraging them to breed in small glass fish tanks, made homey with a moist paper towel and a rock or two, is harder than one might think. Frogs may require the right phase of the moon, or certain bugs, rainfall, songs, or other mysterious clues before they mate. After they reproduce, the hard work continues. Tadpoles are hatching with strange deformities. \u201cWe have to do our job, for a while longer. We have to be successful. Maybe we\u2019ll have too many frogs, maybe thousands and thousands. That would be great. But then what are we going to do with them?\u201d said Heidi Ross, director of EVACC. The hope is that their offspring will soon be returned to the wild, as early as next year. But huge obstacles remain. \u201cWe basically have to become really good frog farmers and breed a lot of frogs, \u201d said Brian Gratwicke, project coordinator for the Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project at the Smithsonian. \u201cBut the last thing we want to do is release these precious, expensive frogs back into wild, just to see them consumed by the fungus all over again.\u201d Gratwicke hopes his colleagues will find a silver bullet. \u201cBut the remedy eludes us,\u201d he said. Some frog species harbor anti-biological agents on their skin that serve as a powerful protection against the fungus. But scientists have not figured out a way to transfer that agent to vulnerable frogs. There could be a vaccine \u2014 someday. Another idea is to challenge captive frogs with the fungus, and select the few that survive, then return their offspring to the wild. Some individual frogs may have behavior traits that offer them more protection. Frogs that bask in the sun appear to do better, because the fungus does not thrive in high temperatures. Maybe nature will take its course, and some frog species will make it out in the wild, and others will be lost forever. \u201cThe quiet is incredible,\u201d said Jamie Voyles, a scientist at the University of California at Berkeley who was the first to understand the precise mechanism of Bd death. She is standing in a silent stream in Panama. \u201cI used to collect here, take samples, and it would be please, not another frog! It\u2019s 4 a.m. and I want to go home. Now I\u2019m begging them. Come back.\u201d", "Title: Newly discovered frog gives birth to live tadpoles, a first Content: Most frogs lay unfertilized eggs to reproduce, but some species have weird variations on the model. There are frogs that fertilize their eggs inside their bodies before laying them, and even ones that allow those eggs to hatch inside them and emerge as fully-formed froglets (fair warning, that link goes to a video of baby frogs squeezing out of holes in their mom's back). *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Now, for the first time, scientists have found a frog that gives birth to something in between: live, wriggling tadpoles. \"This new frog is one of only 10 or 12 species that has evolved internal fertilization, and of those, it is the only one that gives birth to tadpoles, as opposed to froglets or laying fertilized eggs,\" Jim McGuire from the University of California told the BBC. McGuire and his colleagues published their discovery of the frog earlier this week in the journal PLOS ONE. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The new frog is called _Limnonectes larvaepartus_ \\-- a name that translates to \"marsh swimmer that gives birth to larvae\" -- and lives in Indonesia. It's known as a fanged frog, because the males of the species have two lower jaw projections that they use to fight each other. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Ben Tapley, team leader of herpetology at the Zoological Society of London (who wasn't involved in the frog's discovery) told the BBC that the frog itself is actually kind of boring -- until you look at its reproductive practices. \"Finding a new species is not that rare - but actually discovering a new reproductive mode is,\" Tapley said. \"There are more than 40 of these modes in amphibians, but this one is obviously totally unique.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"Reproduction in most frogs could not be more different from human reproduction,\" study author McGuire told Reuters. \"In this case, what is most interesting, ironically, is that the reproductive mode is more similar to our own.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Because when it comes down to it, this is basically what humans do: We don't give birth to autonomous little humans capable of hopping away, but our reproductive systems certainly do plenty of internal baking before a baby is born. Giving birth to a tadpole is sort of like giving birth to an infant. Ish. What's really cool about _Limnonectes larvaepartus_ is that scientists don't know how it manages its strange method of reproduction. Frogs don't have the sexual organs traditionally associated with internal sperm/egg meet-ups. Some species that use internal fertilization have developed tails that act as pseudo-penises, pushing sperm into the female's body, but male _Limnonectes larvaepartus_ don't have those. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And since the researchers haven't watched a female give birth to tadpoles in the wild (though one did spew them out when a researcher picked her up), it's possible that the species is even more unique. Perhaps, the researchers write, the frogs actually intend to give birth to little froglets -- but are also capable of dropping tadpoles that can survive in the outside world, in a pinch. This is unlikely, they say, but a frog who could choose to give birth to babies, which are in different stages of development, would be a singular species indeed. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the discovery of a new lizard species, not a frog species.

In 2016, there were about 4,500 flipped houses sold in the District. The supply of single-family residences, including rowhouses and detached dwellings, grows very little compared to the condominium market because of a lack of land available for constructing homes. Thus, flipped properties may be attractive to some buyers seeking a like-new home. But although newly constructed homes in the District are under a two-year warranty after the first unit in the project is sold, flipped properties do not have the same protection. Here are tips to help you avoid some of the pitfalls often associated with buying a flipped home: Most of the rowhouses in the District are about 100 years old in most places (if not older). With most flipped properties, the chain of title of the home likely extends through many owners. Using the District\u2019s Office and Tax Revenue real property tax database along with the multiple-listing service, a prospective owner can learn many details regarding the history of a property. This can tell you many things, such as how long the flipper has spent working on the property. Because of the historically high rates of returns on flipped properties in the District, there has been an influx of developers throughout the city. However, some developers may have more experience than others in flipping properties. Part-time developers may flip one to two properties a year, while full-time developers may develop more each year. Regardless, purchasers should ask for a history of properties the developer has completed. These examples will also show a buyer how long a flipper\u2019s properties remain on market, on average what they sell for, as well as other considerations for a potential offer. Moreover, high-quality builders are often more forthcoming with information regarding their renovation. From the types of materials used to a development timeline, the more information a purchaser can obtain, the better. This information can then be analyzed for quality and durability. While the finished product may appear polished, high-quality materials will be needed to stand the test of time. Purchasers may also want to consider contacting the architect and head general contractor for a project before deciding on making an offer. A properly done flip will include a quality aesthetic that extends beyond the walls. However, most purchasers can get a good idea of the quality of a flipped project just by looking around. For example, does the craftsmanship of simple projects such as caulking and mortaring look uniform? Do the appliances work properly? Does the home appear to be uniformly completed instead of just a few spaces? One contingency purchasers should not neglect if uncomfortable with these questions would be a home inspection. While a home inspector won\u2019t be able to look beyond the walls in most cases, the inspector can test the safety of the home and look at the major elements of a home: electrical, plumbing, structure and functionality of major components. For buyers interested in a flip but in competitive situations, this inspection can occur prior to submitting an offer, thus waiving their right to inspect as a contingency of their contract. Most of the real work done in improving a property may be behind the walls. While a home inspector can check the safety and code of an electrical panel, much of the electrical and plumbing work will not be noticeable in a home inspection. In this case, potential buyers should obtain as much information about the contractor, subcontractors and architects of work done beyond the walls of the home. For the most part, obtaining a loan on a flipped property is straightforward. However, obtaining a loan will be subject to an appraisal, and purchasers should note that flipped homes may be priced on the high end of their desired market. In this case, low appraisals are certainly a possibility. Specific to Federal Housing Administration buyers, purchasers may not enter a contract until the investor has owned the property for at least 90 days. This may avoid quick flip jobs but does make FHA buyers slightly less competitive if the owner has flipped a property quickly. Moreover, properties owned for less than 180 days to be financed with an FHA loan may be subject to other considerations such as a second appraisal. At the end of the day, expect the unexpected. Many home buyers decide to negotiate a home warranty as a part of their contract or choose to purchase one on their own. These warranties are offered in tiered pricing, covering different elements of the home at different price points. Additionally, buyers should also make sure to keep records of the manufacturer\u2019s warranty on major appliances in the kitchen, HVAC and any warranties that may come with a new roof.", "Title: What three psychics told us will happen in the 2016 election Content: This will be the last article The Washington Post writes about the 2016 campaign. There's no point, you see, for we already know how it turns out -- thanks to the combined efforts of three New York City psychics. Or, to be precise: One astrologer, one numerologist/healer and one tarot card reader whose hand is guided by the archangel Michael. Over several recent visits, the three used their unique gifts to outline what we can expect from American politics for the next 16 months. And we -- in service to journalism, enlightenment and the ineffable binds of the universe -- present their revelations to you. The theme of the apartment is pink, including a decent percentage of Eyedealism's hair. It's part of her shtick. \"I've been an astrologer for over 20 years,\" she told me. \"I'm also a singer and performance artist.\" The picture at right shows her ready to perform. When we met, she apologized for not being similarly made up; she was at maybe 90 percent. Here's what one of those charts looks like. It's Jeb Bush's \"natal chart,\" as it appeared on her computer while we spoke. It shows the position of the heavens at the time and place of his birth: Feb. 11, 1953, 8:50 p.m. in Midland, Tex. It's very complex, plotting 12 houses (the inner circle numbered 1 through 12) in four quadrants, and identifying four significant cusps (transitions between houses). Each house has meaning (the ninth, for example, is the house of politics, as well as some other things), each quadrant has meaning, and the celestial bodies represented on the chart -- which travel around it, counter-clockwise -- all have meaning, too. What Eyedealism does is interpret the overlap and relationships of all of it. Or the future of the presidency. But since the planets keep moving, and since we were looking at the skies right now, I asked how long Clinton could expect all these wonderful things to stay so wonderful. Jupiter, it turns out, will stay in her 10th house for a year after this fall. But all that luck won't evaporate a year from this fall (that is, right before Election Day), because she can keep building on the luck. A few minor details: Clinton does want to watch her personality, though, because she has Saturn (Debbie Downer) in her personality house, Eyedealism explained. She's private and a bit paranoid (lots of Scorpio placements). She was born to speak to the public (Mercury conjuncts her ascendant). Luck, power and organization are on her side, but she has to clean up her socializing persona. Other than that? Inevitable! Bush's moon is in Capricorn, which has some tricky historic significance. Eyedealism outlined a variety of meanings one could derive from it, but the end results are: Jeb Bush would apparently rather have been an actor. Bush has one favorable point. \"His natal Vulcanus, the asteroid of strength and power, closely conjucts the M.C.\" -- meaning that strength and power are in his future, although Vulcanus is not nearly as big a deal as, say, Jupiter. Bush also should be good at using the Internet to raise money, because Uranus is in his eighth house, the house of money. \"Very powerful friends will be giving him money and luck right now,\" she said, which seems about right. So, hey, let's look at Donald Trump. \"I think I sold him a lollipop in a nightclub,\" Eyedealism said, somewhat off-topic. \"Mr. Fuji's Tropicana. It was 1992. He was very charming. He was very sweet. I gave him a lollipop for some reason.\" Returning to his astrology, Eyedealism announced: \"He has Caput on his M.C.!\" Meaning, he has nothing, I asked? No, Caput is \"a demon star,\" one of the eyes of Taurus, which can be \"fed\" dark, edgy art, music and politics to earn wealth. Picasso had Caput on his M.C., she said; same with Johnny Depp. Trump also has Jupiter in his house of money, so he has a lot of cash coming in and out (from himself?). He has Regulus on his ascendant, which explains his big hair for a reason I didn't follow. And also, Trump has a trine. \"Oh. Wow wow wow wow,\" Eyedealism said, staring through the pink darkness into her bright screen. \"He has an exact trine between Uranus and Jupiter in his chart!\" A trine is a good thing, and it means (as best I can tell) that objects appear at the same degree four houses apart. (So they neatly split the circle into a third.) Trump has Uranus in his 10th house -- career -- at 17 degrees, and Jupiter in the second house -- money -- also at 17 degrees. \"This guy would have to try very hard not to be a television celebrity with lots of money,\" she said. \"He'd have to try very, very hard.\" I had to ask, then, what about all the other people who were born at the same time in the same place -- New York City. \"Remember, not everyone lives out the potential of their chart,\" Eyedealism replied. \"We have choices.\" Some people who could have been Donald Trump made choices not to be. Bad choices! An important final note: In the second week of August, he's likely to gain some weight. But after we spoke, Eyedealism sent an e-mail in which she was even firmer. The e-mail looked at the skies over Dixville Notch, N.H., on Election Night 2016. Dixville Notch is a tiny town with a handful of voters that opens for voting shortly after midnight to be the first to cast its votes. It's a fun tradition that kicks off the voting. \"According to [her personal adviser and astrologer] Bob Marks,\" she wrote in the e-mail, \"if the chart is not adversely aspected, the party in power stays in power. The Democrats will stay in power, according to this chart, so whoever wins the Democratic primary will be the next President of the United States.\" Meaning that Hillary Clinton will be our next president, unless, I guess, she chooses not to be. \"I have been a psychic professional healer and adviser for over 25 years,\" she said, \"and have now graduated to psychic matchmaking.\" Her matchmaking will center on \"numerology and their capability soul number.\" Numerology was the tool on which she focused using with the 2016 candidates -- again based on their birth dates -- but she also looped in her understanding of the candidates' energy and chakras, a.k.a. the theoretical centers of spiritual power in the body (based on a sheet of photographs I provided). The numerology is a bit more accessible. Here's how you calculate Hillary Clinton's power number. Take her birth date -- Oct. 26, 1947 -- and add all the digits. 1+0 plus 2+6 plus 1+9+4+7 , giving a total of 30. Then, take her current age -- 67 -- and add those digits together: 13. Then add all of the digits: 3 + 0 + 1 + 3, giving Clinton a soul number of 7. That number tells Johnson some of what she needs to know about the person. Johnson explained what a power number of 8 means. \"She's in the cycle: What she's giving out is what she's going to receive,\" Johnson said. \"What her goal is set out to do, she's going to stand behind it, because it's going to come back to her.\" This is a positive. \"Out of everybody,\" she said, \"she's in the lead with her numbers.\" (What does a number of 7 mean? Stay tuned.) As for the photo-telepathy reading, Johnson \"likes Hillary's energy,\" but Clinton wasn't opening herself up to others. \"When people see a woman coming forward, they want to see her feminism coming out. They want to see some of her emotions. They don't just want to see a robot. With a man, it's okay if they see a robot.\" His name, however, was a problem. His last name wasn't great, because while Johnson \"get[s] such good vibrations from him ... the background of his family is so negative. So we need a power to come out of him.\" And then there's his first name. His name isn't really Jeb, as you probably know. It's John Ellis Bush, J.E.B. \"If they would call him John, he would have much more power,\" Johnson said. \"In numerology, your name represents your strength. It represents his power number. When you break down his name, it depletes his character. It depletes his strength.\" However, she pointed to one photo. \"This guy's energy is interesting!\" she declared. \"Who is he?\" That, I told her, was Rand Paul. She liked his energy, because it seemed strong. America needs a president who is strong, that our enemies would be afraid to combat, she said, and many of the other candidates were weak. We ran Paul's number: 7. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"He has the soul number. The soul number is a spiritual number, so he channels people's energy. He's probably very good with people, probably can take the most negative person and turn them around. ... He's a people person. He'd be good for negotiations because his spirit is so likable.\" \"I bet if you talk to a lot of people who know him,\" she said, \"they'll say that.\" Presumably, this also holds for Clinton, too. I met Angela Lucy in her doorman building by Union Square. Lucy had gotten interested in tarot in college, thanks to her roommate. She taught herself how to read cards and slowly started reading for people. About four years ago, she decided to give up the temp agency she ran and focus on tarot full-time. As we spoke, it struck me that it was interesting that her name was Angela, given that the first person I spoke with was named \"Angel\" and the third \"Angelia.\" I asked Lucy if the name was common in her profession. She asked the cards. \"They were trying to keep you away from the dark people,\" she said, meaning fortune-tellers with nefarious motives. So: Thanks, Angels. Lucy would hand me the deck of tarot cards, 78 in total and one of the scores of sets she owns. The one we used was large, maybe the size of a large cellphone, and heavy. You've probably seen tarot cards in person or in movies: The Hanged Man, The Wheel of Fortune, etc. There are also numbered, suited cards something like a normal deck of playing cards, but with unusual suits: wands (staves, on her deck), cups, swords and pentacles. Each card has its own meaning, as do the suits and the figures. I would think of a question I wanted the cards to answer as I shuffled them. When I was done, I gave them back to Lucy, who cut them as she quietly intoned a request to Michael. Then, she'd flip over the cards and offer her insights on what they meant. First, Bush. She flipped a card: The seven of wands. \"He's going to be a contender,\" she said. The card generally means success. When considering things like chances or odds, she reads the number -- seven -- as a percentage, say, 70 percent. Next, Rubio. She flipped a card: The three of pentacles. The race will be \"a learning experience for him. Let's put it this way: He'll get schooled,\" she said. (The three of pentacles means learning or schooling.) Third, Walker. She flipped a card: The queen of swords. \"Um, what's going on with his wife?\" she asked. (On my recording, I reply: \"Uh, I don't know?\") \"I get a wife or a woman, something happening with a very intelligent, mathematically minded woman,\" she said -- and probably not Clinton, because this was just within the primary. Then we did three more: Ben Carson (whom she likes), Rand Paul and Donald Trump. Carson: two of pentacles. \"He's going to do okay,\" she said. But it's a low number, so she's thinking vice president. Paul and Trump's cards I didn't write down (is this a sign?) and they got reshuffled before I could take a picture. But both will do well. Paul is \"going to be up there,\" Lucy said. But \"he has a lot of subconscious fears.\" She had a physical reaction to him. \"I feel it here,\" she said, holding her stomach. \"He's scared. I'm feeling it right here. He's definitely a contender, but he's fearful.\" Trump? \"I get him really being up there!\" she said. \"This is a very confident card.\" We started with Hillary Clinton: Five of cups. That means heartbreak or divorce. \"I'm getting a sadness,\" Lucy said. \"I'm wondering if something sad happens. This is an emotional thing. Wow.\" Curious about the weird result, Lucy flipped more cards. \"Something bad's going to happen. ... Power. ... Something about another woman. ... There's some tragedy.\" Michael was unable to offer more clarity on that point. He was, though, on the key point. \"Michael, is she going to get the nomination?\" Lucy asked. She flipped the ace of cups (which she described as a \"yes\" card). \"She's going to get the nomination,\" she said, \"but there's something emotional that happens\" -- maybe something that inspires sympathy in voters. As expected, Clinton's opponents aren't going to offer much resistance. Bernie Sanders: The princess of swords. \"He's not serious. He's just messing with Hillary,\" Lucy said. \"He doesn't want it. He's pushing it away.\" Ouch. She flipped Wheel of Fortune for the Democrats -- but upside down. \"I get only a 10 percent chance and this card came upside down ... it means turning in reverse.\" For the Republicans, she got no number at all. So she pulled a third card, the six of cups, for an independent candidate. \"Sixty percent chance an independent candidate spoiler!\" she said. (And then laughed, \"Maybe it's Ben Carson!\") These are the moments that fans of psychics pay for. The independent threw everything off. The first card she flipped was focused on nostalgia, meaning perhaps someone voters had known before. She kept flipping cards: Someone sweet. Someone people knew and liked. Someone with a strong wife, or perhaps a strong independent woman, like Carly Fiorina. Someone people will be talking about, Lucy said -- which, if this in fact happened, would be a safe bet. She asked Michael how she was doing on the reading as she was trying to sort out the independent candidate. \"He's reminding me that there's a lot of subconscious stuff that's still floating around in the ethers.\" The closer to an event, the better the reading. With a laugh, Lucy offered a recommendation for any candidates seeking more insight: Come see her for a reading shortly before any big decisions. We'll point out, though, that doing so would be for entertainment purposes only.", "Title: Flipping homes goes high-end Content: In the art of house-flipping, profit is key. And a successful flip in the District can garner a profit of more than $260,000, the highest in the nation, according to data released Thursday. That\u2019s nearly five times the national average of about $55,000. The District also eclipses its neighbors in Maryland and Virginia, where investors average a profit of $75,000 and $9,600, respectively. The practice of buying cheap (often foreclosed) homes, fixing them up and selling them for a profit was wildly popular during the housing boom, and it continued after the bubble burst. But the housing market\u2019s recovery is forcing flippers to change strategies and set their sights higher. Nationally, the share of homes being flipped that were sold for $750,000 or more has soared in the past year, even as the total number of homes being flipped has fallen 13 percent, according to a report by RealtyTrac, a real estate listing firm. In the third quarter, the number of homes flipped in the $1 million to $2 million price range rose 42 percent compared with a year ago. For homes priced between $2 million and $5 million, the increase was 350 percent for the same period. (RealtyTrac defines a property that is bought and sold within six months as a flip.) **** Rising home prices and fewer foreclosures have made flipping less profitable, said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. Investors are facing some of the same problems as regular home buyers: a shortage of homes for sale and competition from Wall Street investors who buy homes en masse to convert them into rental units. \u201cThe lower- to middle-range homes are preferable to flippers because they require less [renovation] work,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cBut there\u2019s fewer of those properties available.\u201d Rising mortgage rates have started to price some buyers out of the market and have made it more difficult for real estate investors to guarantee a quick sale \u2014 or a sizable profit. **** \u201cFlippers are getting fewer offers, and they tie it to the interest rates,\u201d Blomquist said. The30-year fixed rate reached 4.28 percent last week, according to mortgage financing company Freddie Mac. ****House-flipping remains particularly popular in Maryland, where there is still a large inventory of cheap foreclosed homes, Blomquist said. Flips rose 12 percent during the third quarter compared with a year ago. Maryland\u2019s Baltimore-Towson region was among the top 10 most popular markets for investors, according to the report. Nearly 300 flipped homes were quickly bought and sold during the third quarter, an increase of 6 percent from a year ago. Investment activity rose 8 percent in the District during the same period, but it declined 3 percent in Virginia, according to the report. **** Virginia\u2019s rapidly rising home prices make it attractive to flippers, but there aren\u2019t enough homes for sale, Blomquist said. The District has fewer flips overall, but if an investor manages to acquire and renovate a property, there is no shortage of buyers, he said. \u201cThe market\u2019s really dried up,\u201d said Justin Pierce, a real estate investor based in the Washington area. (Pierce occasionally writes a column for The Washington Post.) \u201cA lot of us have moved to the higher-end areas.\u201d When it comes to high-end flips, activity is concentrated in a few corners of the country, the report said. **** California, for example, remains a hot market. More than 2,100 homes were flipped in the Los Angeles metro area during the third quarter, the most of any region in the country and up 11 percent compared with a year ago. New York\u2019s northern New Jersey-Long Island metro area is also popular, with 2,075 homes flipped in the third quarter, an increase of 14 percent from last year. \u201cIf someone still wants to flip a property, [the higher end] is the only place they can find the opportunity,\u201d **** said Rich Cosner, president of Prudential California Realty, a firm in Orange County. \u201cThere\u2019s very few flipping opportunities for homes under $400,000 anymore.\u201d", "Title: Flipping houses is booming business again Content: Not long ago, John Irvin was selling women\u2019s shoes in the \u00adNordstrom at the Pentagon City mall, pulling down about $20 an hour. Now he flips houses in Northern Virginia \u2014 scooping up short sales, rehabbing them and aiming for a quick sell. He has sold three homes and says he netted more than $30,000 in profit each time. \u201cIf I do one house every quarter, I\u2019m making $125,000 a year \u2014 at 25 years old,\u201d Irvin said. \u201cAll my other friends, they have a 9-to-5 job. They make probably half of what I\u2019m making right now. It\u2019s kind of like hitting the lottery.\u201d Flipping earned a bad reputation during the housing boom thanks to speculators who bought and sold millions of homes in search of easy profits. But the practice is gaining popularity again as the nation\u2019s real estate market shows signs of life. The number of flips rose 25 percent during the first half of 2012 from the same period a year earlier, according to research firm RealtyTrac, and the gross profit on each property averaged $29,342. RealtyTrac Vice President Daren Blomquist said the resurgence in flipping offers another indication that, in many parts of the country, housing prices have finally stopped falling. \u201cThere are flippers in any market, but a market where home prices are appreciating is much more forgiving for flippers than a market where prices are depreciating,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cWe have turned that corner in a lot of places in the last six months, so that\u2019s going to attract flippers.\u201d Areas of the country that were hit particularly hard by the housing crash have seen the most pronounced boom in flipping, as investors gobble up foreclosures and short sales \u2014 properties sold for less than the owners owe on the mortgage \u2014 and resell them to buyers eager to take advantage of record-low interest rates. The Phoenix area leads the country with nearly 10,000 flipped properties during the first half of this year. Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami and Atlanta also are high on the list. Maryland and Virginia also have seen an increase in the number of flips during the past year, according to RealtyTrac. The District saw a sharp increase starting two years ago though the percentage in the last year is down slightly. \u201cLoan applications have tripled in the past few months,\u201d said Justin Konz, an executive at Chantilly-based Restoration Capital, a \u201chard money\u201d lender that provides fast, short-term financing to flippers. Konz said the firm funds everyone from weekend warriors flipping a house or two a year to professionals turning around dozens of houses a month. \u201cWe thought it would slow down in the colder months,\u201d Konz said. Instead, he said, business has picked up heading into the fall, with few signs of slowing. With numerous investors and home buyers vying for a small list of available properties in the District and close-in suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, bidding wars and outsized offers have become a routine part of the landscape. The average gross profit for flipping a home in Maryland and Virginia is about $55,000, and it\u2019s even higher in the District, according to RealtyTrac. \u201cIt\u2019s very competitive for people doing what I do, and the margins are very thin,\u201d said Jud Allen, co-owner of D.C.-based Express Homebuyers, a company that flips dozens of local properties a year. \u201cThe upside is, if you can find a deal, you know you can sell it and make some money. The difficulty is in finding the deals, not selling the property.\u201d The flippers flocking to the market today are often a different breed than the opportunistic investors that helped fuel the housing boom. \u201cThe flippers we saw going crazy at the height of the real estate bubble were very speculative in nature and were solely relying on home price appreciation to continue at a torrid pace,\u201d said Blomquist of RealtyTrac. \u201cThe flippers we\u2019re seeing these days have to be much more cautious. . . . They\u2019re not just relying on time to increase the value of the property; they are improving it.\u201d The new generation of flippers can still frustrate some would-be home buyers by snapping up properties with cash offers and exacerbating low inventories in certain markets. But Blomquist said they also are playing a useful role. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are still some bad players out there,\u201d he said. But \u201cthe type of property flippers we\u2019re seeing do provide an important function toward getting us to a recovery. They are taking distressed inventory others are not willing to take on.\u201d Doug Clark, a veteran real estate investor in Utah and co-host of the Spike TV show \u201cFlip Men,\u201ddoesn\u2019t miss the boom days when home flipping reached stratospheric levels. \u201cEverything was speculation. Anything you bought was worth more the next morning. . . . You can\u2019t do that these days and stay in business,\u201d Clark said. Instead, he said, being successful requires a keen eye for undervalued properties and a willingness to put in the work required to make the houses attractive to buyers. Irvin, the 25-year-old flipper in Virginia, carefully researched each of his three properties \u2014 one in Dale City and a pair in Manassas \u2014 before buying. He said he spent tens of thousands of dollars improving the houses, refinishing hardwood floors, updating bathrooms, installing new kitchen cabinets and appliances, and landscaping yards but stuck to a tight budget to maximize his profit. Irvin, who has a business management degree from George Mason University, plans to close on his fourth short sale this month, a home in Fairfax County that is larger and pricier than any he has flipped so far. With low interest rates, scarce inventory, rising home prices and willing buyers around Washington, he doesn\u2019t plan on selling shoes again anytime soon. \u201cThere\u2019s always somebody who\u2019s going to want to buy your house,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as there are short sales or foreclosures, I\u2019m definitely going to want to be doing this.\u201d", "Title: D.C. area sees a spike in house flipping Content: Flipping houses \u2014 where a house is bought, renovated and resold within months \u2014 is undergoing a resurgence in the D.C. area, according to a report released Friday by RealtyTrac, a real estate data firm. The company looked at single-family homes that were resold within six months after purchase, from January to June of this year, and found that this region showed a 108 percent increase in flipping compared to the first six months of 2012. And it ranked it among the top 15 markets for profitable home flipping based on the resale value of these houses. The report also showed that flipping is cooling in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Southern California, places that previously had been hot spots. Daren Blomquist, vice president of RealtyTrac, sees a wave moving across the country from west to east. The wave is the housing recovery, and it is driving trends such as flipping. \u201cIt hit markets like Southern California and Phoenix first because those were the first to see the bounce off the bottom in home prices,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas in places like D.C. . . . the market is somewhat untapped from a flippers\u2019 perspective.\u201d There were 3,169 single-family homes that were flipped in the D.C. region the first six months of this year. The average purchase price for a house that was going to be flipped was $403,441 \u2014 fourth highest in the country, behind only San Jose, San Francisco and Ocean City, N.J. But for those who have the money, the return can be great. The average gross profit \u2014 the difference between the purchase and sale price \u2014 was $46,205. It is worth noting that RealtyTrac did not factor in how much was spent on the rehab. The report also broke down flipping by state. For the entire state of Virginia, flipping was up 135 percent. In Maryland, it was up 104 percent, and in the District, it was unchanged. Because of its small housing inventory and its cumbersome foreclosure process, the District had only 57 houses flipped in the first six months this year. But those investors who can find houses to fix up, it is well worth their effort. The average purchase price in the District for houses to be flipped was $238,298, about 28 percent below market value. The average gross profit on those houses once they were resold was $191,103. \u201cMy guess is what\u2019s happening there is that the homes that the flippers are getting are very highly distressed properties in need of a lot of work,\u201d Blomquist said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting them at very low prices, but they\u2019re probably having to put a lot into them, which unfortunately is not reflected here. But once they do, it\u2019s such a hot market and such limited inventory, they are able to sell it at a premium.\u201d Blomquist said he believes the increase in Maryland can be attributed to the uptick in foreclosure activity. Unlike Virginia, which moved relatively quickly through the foreclosure process, Maryland had a more deliberate system. As a result, a backlog of distressed properties is now coming onto the market. In June, Maryland had a 162 percent year over year increase in foreclosure activity, the fifth month in a row of triple digit percentage increases. The more foreclosed properties on the market, the more opportunities for real estate investors. Rising mortgage rates don\u2019t appear to have a dampening effect on flipping, since most real estate investors pay cash or finance through a hard money lender. However, the rising rates are making it more challenging for the investors to sell their properties once they have renovated them. For those thinking now is the time to jump into real estate investing, you may be too late. Blomquist doesn\u2019t see this trend lasting. \u201cWe\u2019ll see the numbers taper back off,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect storm for flipping right now. You\u2019re really seeing a market that\u2019s evolving from a distressed market to a recovering market so that\u2019s a great window of opportunity for flippers. But once that window is gone and home prices normalize and the distressed properties have also normalized to a low level, then the volumes will go back down.\u201d"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage provides direct advice on how to avoid pitfalls when buying a flipped home, which is closely related to the query about not flipping out when flipping a house.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most practical and detailed advice, making it the most relevant to the query.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Here are tips to help you avoid some of the pitfalls often associated with buying a flipped home: Most of the rowhouses in the District are about 100 years old in most places (if not older)."}, {"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the high-end flipping of homes and the changing strategies due to the housing market's recovery, which is somewhat related to the query.", "listwise_reason": "While it doesn't provide direct advice like passage 1, it offers insights into the market trends and strategies, making it more relevant than passages 2, 4, and 5.", "direct_answer_sentence": "But the housing market\u2019s recovery is forcing flippers to change strategies and set their sights higher."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage talks about the resurgence of house flipping and the profits it can bring, which is indirectly related to the query.", "listwise_reason": "Although it doesn't provide direct advice or strategies, it offers a perspective on the profitability of house flipping, making it more relevant than passages 2 and 5.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Flipping earned a bad reputation during the housing boom thanks to speculators who bought and sold millions of homes in search of easy profits."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the resurgence of house flipping in the D.C. area and the potential profits, which is indirectly related to the query.", "listwise_reason": "While it provides some market insights, it doesn't offer direct advice or strategies, making it less relevant than passages 1, 3, and 4.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Flipping houses \u2014 where a house is bought, renovated and resold within months \u2014 is undergoing a resurgence in the D.C. area."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage is about psychics predicting the 2016 election and has no relevance to the query about house flipping.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to the other passages, this one provides no relevant information or insights related to the query.", "direct_answer_sentence": "This will be the last article The Washington Post writes about the 2016 campaign."}]}, "scores": [9.65839958190918, 9.600199699401855, 9.538900375366211, 9.460100173950195, 9.458700180053711]}

Many leaders of historically black colleges had been pleased by overtures from the administration from the earliest days of Trump\u2019s presidency, including an Oval Office meeting with university presidents in February. But some were startled by a signing statement connected to a recently approved federal funding measure, released Friday, in which the White House said it would treat a program that helps such schools get low-cost construction loans in a manner consistent with the constitutional requirement to afford equal protection of the laws. Advocates worried that meant the president might scrap a capital financing program, approved in 1992, that helps historically black colleges build, repair and renovate. That prompted an outcry from people such as Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. They called the signing statement \u201cstunningly careless and divisive,\u201d adding: \u201cWe urge him to reconsider immediately.\u201d On Sunday night, Trump said in a statement: \u201cThe statement that accompanied my signing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, sets forth my intention to spend the funds it appropriates, including the funds for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), consistently with my responsibilities under the Constitution. It does not affect my unwavering support for HBCUs and their critical educational missions.\u201d He noted past commitments: \u201cIn February of this year, I signed an executive order pledging to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education; to ensure equitable opportunities for HBCUs to participate in federal programs; and to increase the number of college-educated Americans who feel empowered and able to advance the common good at home and abroad. \u201cMy commitment to the above-stated goals remains unchanged. \u201cIn a few days, my Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will give the commencement address at Bethune-Cookman University, a school founded by the great Mary McCleod Bethune and committed to leadership and service. Secretary DeVos chose an HBCU as the venue for her first commencement address to demonstrate my administration\u2019s dedication to these great institutions of higher learning. \u201cI look forward to selecting an executive director and board for my HBCU initiative and continuing this important work with HBCUs throughout the nation.\u201d The statement misspelled the name of civil rights activist and educator Mary McLeod Bethune. Harry Williams, president of Delaware State University, said he could easily imagine a staffer making a mistake while typing the release. He said familiarity may be an issue, as well. \u201cIn the African American community, I\u2019m sure people are very familiar with that name.\u201d But he said he was thinking of the substance of the message, which pleased him. \u201cPeople make mistakes.\u201d A White House official did not respond to a question about the misspelling, but wrote Monday afternoon: \u201cThe signing statement is not intended in any way to suggest that there will be any change with the program or that it is unconstitutional. It is intended merely to indicate that the program will continue to be implemented based on the traditional definition of HBCUs, which is based on mission and history and thus consistent with equal protection principles. The President and Secretary DeVos unambiguously reiterated their complete, unwavering support for HBCUs. So it should be clear that this is in no way a policy change or suggestion that the provision will not be implemented.\u201d College presidents were pleased to see the statement of \u201cunwavering support\u201d for HBCUs, said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., president and chief executive of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. When people saw the statement Friday evening, he said, many were upset and asking questions. \u201cThey\u2019re still bothered that it happened,\u201d he said, but they were glad the president responded so quickly to their concerns. \u201cThere was a lot of noise in the community\u201d after the signing statement, said Williams, the Delaware State University president. He said he was wondering about it, too. \u201cThis is not a new program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s been here for a while, so to question whether or not it is discriminatory, I felt, is a little bit odd. So when I got the statement last night I felt much better, because he came out and basically reinforced what he had said when we were at the White House about his support for HBCUs.\u201d Williams said he is cautiously optimistic about the administration. He felt it was responsive to HBCU requests that Pell grants for students from low-income families be available year-round. Since about 70 percent of students at historically black colleges, on average, are eligible to receive the grants, Williams said they could help students continue their studies during the summer and graduate more quickly. \u201cThere\u2019s some dialogue here that is helpful\u2026. We need to keep the conversation going.\u201d Richmond and Conyers responded with a statement Monday afternoon, dismissing Trump\u2019s words as \u201cjust PR.\u201d \u201cHe held a meeting with more than 70 HBCU presidents in February and then said after the meeting that they didn\u2019t ask him for anything even though they did. He signed an executive order that moves the HBCU initiative into the White House but does little else.\u201d They wrote that the funding for programs such a year-round Pell grants in the bill signed Friday was the result of negotiations by congressional Republicans and Democrats that began before President Trump took office. The National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO) responded to the president\u2019s statement on Monday: \u201cNAFEO appreciates the clarification by President Trump. We are pleased that President Trump underscored his unfaltering commitment to investing in HBCUs.\u201d The United Negro College Fund said in a statement Monday afternoon: \u201cWe are gratified that the administration has reaffirmed its support for HBCUs; however, the signing statement has suggested that the administration has some doubt about the constitutionality of HBCU programs and that doubt needs to removed. \u201cThe FY 2017 omnibus appropriated funds in the U.S. Department of Education and other federal agencies, including the HBCU Capital Financing Program, and we look forward to the administration executing those funds as quickly as possible for the benefit of the nation\u2019s HBCUs and the 300,000 students they serve.\u201d The administration reached out early, and eagerly, to historically black colleges and universities. During the Oval Office meeting, Vice President Pence expressed the administration\u2019s support for such schools. DeVos\u2019s first visit to a school in the United States as education secretary was to Howard University, a historically black university. That outreach was welcomed by many, and greeted with skepticism and protest by others. Some students \u2014 as at Howard, where there were demonstrations \u2014 called on university presidents to reject the overtures. DeVos struck a discordant note for many when she described historically black colleges, in a statement, as pioneers of school choice. She clarified the next day that the schools were founded at a time of limited, if any, educational opportunities for African Americans. Taylor said people were upset by that, but he noted that when then-Vice President Joe Biden referred to the \u201cnation of Africa\u201d in a speech to African leaders in 2014, \u201cyou didn\u2019t see this total meltdown.\u201d Many took it as a misstatement, Taylor said, a gaffe rather than a revelation of ignorance. A group of students, alumni and others said they plan to present petitions to the Bethune-Cookman administration Tuesday, calling on the university\u2019s president to revoke DeVos\u2019s invitation to speak at commencement. DeVos released a statement Sunday night expressing her support for historically black colleges and the critical role they play, saying she would continue to be an advocate for them and that she was looking forward to visiting Bethune-Cookman this week.", "Title: The future of historically black colleges Content: _Daryl Michael Scott is a professor of history at Howard University._ Ron Stodghill\u2019s exploration of the status of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) comes at a moment when our entire university system is imperiled. Since the rise of globalism, policymakers have insisted that the nation\u2019s continued greatness depends on being the brains, rather than the brawn, of the world economy. Despite this, the federal government, reeling from war debt and the Great Recession, has joined states in limiting its investment in higher education. Increasingly, the justification for funding has shifted from the need for an educated citizenry to workforce development. We are witnessing the decline of the American research university and an existential threat to all but a handful of HBCUs. A journalist and a professor at Johnson C. Smith University, an HBCU in Charlotte, Stodghill is committed to the future of HBCUs but calls on them to get their houses in order before it\u2019s too late. While acknowledging that state policies and those of the Obama administration, especially changes in the Plus Loan Program, have created an economic hardship on HBCUs, Stodghill sides with reformers who, in general, believe in less dependence on government money, increased standards for admissions, merging and consolidating colleges, more accountability for administrators and boards of trustees, and constructing majors tailored to the marketplace. Unlike some of his interviewees, however, Stodghill believes in the standard justification for HBCUs: providing a more nurturing environment for students. Unfortunately, Stodghill bases his case on historical myths. He holds the view that majority-white schools \u201cpoach\u201d the best black students. (Who owns them?) He seems unaware that those deemed the best students often attended majority-white colleges even during the segregation era. Phi Beta Kappa keys from the Ivies and small Northern colleges were treated much like Olympic medals, while many HBCUs were considered a continuation of high school \u2014 which, given their inadequate funding, they often were. Without doubt, desegregation, along with new federal programs, brought better funding and transformed most HBCUs into viable colleges. Stodghill also promotes the myth that once upon a time, dynamic, committed faculty members and administrators led HBCUs and pursued the path to progress. In this golden age, Howard\u2019s Mordecai Johnson , Morehouse\u2019s Benjamin Mays and Fisk\u2019s committed faculty functioned with integrity and challenged backwardness. This leaves us with a false impression. Those reformers told of a different, more pervasive reality. According to progressive educators, the state HBCUs were run by sycophants who served the white supremacist governors loyally and ensured that black students would not get out of line. In religious schools funded by the American Missionary Association, the paternalism was often stultifying. Most black educational leaders, like our modern-day reformers, preached a gospel of make do with less. Back then, however, the black intelligentsia outright condemned that gospel as part of what Carter G. Woodson referred to as \u201cthe mis-education of the Negro.\u201d While Stodghill\u2019s book has the feel of investigative journalism, the author\u2019s greatest shortcoming is that he is often a captive to his sources, especially in his treatment of the financial crisis at Howard University, where I teach. Most major universities sold their hospitals decades ago to avoid financial devastation, but Howard hasn\u2019t. In 2006, D.C. Mayor Anthony Williams unilaterally rejected Howard President H. Patrick Swygert\u2019s partnership proposal to build a second hospital and spin them both off under a separate corporate entity, which would have ended the university\u2019s responsibility. Since 2013, the financial burden of the hospital has been a matter of public discussion as a result of a leaked memo written by Renee Higginbotham-Brooks, then a long-standing trustee. Based on an interview with her, Stodghill provides a salacious but largely irrelevant account of the dispute she had with then-Board of Trustees Chairman A. Barry Rand and never explores the larger question of whether the board has a viable plan to save the hospital without doing perhaps irreparable damage to the other colleges in the university. Given that the book focuses on the shortcomings of boards, we would have expected more investigation of the HBCU that is the best funded by far and considered the capstone of them all. Stodghill does not ask what motivates trustees and what limits their ability to make the truly hard decisions. Even more than presidents, they sign on to do good and to virtually never do harm, or even risk it. This can paralyze or even prevent them from seeing, let alone making, the toughest decisions. No one joins to close programs that have been at the heart of a school\u2019s mission, to do away with the things that gave meaning and purpose to their own lives. Who wants to close history and philosophy departments \u2014 fields at the heart of promoting democracy \u2014 in favor of criminal justice and medical records-keeping? What trustee wants to close or merge a university out of existence? And sometimes these issues are all too personal to be seen clearly. Higginbotham-Brooks credits Howard\u2019s hospital and medical school with saving her life when she had breast cancer. It is easier to pass the problem along and hope for an intervention from without before death comes from within. For the most part, Stodghill ignores any principled opposition to change. At Howard, Dillard and other HBCUs, the liberal arts tradition is in jeopardy. Ironically, Stodghill invokes the recent history in which protesters demand that HBCUs embrace the changes being mandated by our national obsession with science, technology, engineering and math, the STEM fields. As in the age of industrial education and Booker T. Washington, college is increasingly seen as a place for workforce development rather than intellectual growth and citizenship training. These Bookerites of STEM seem unaware that the fight to save and advance the humanities and social sciences at American universities stands in the age-old tradition of Thomas Jefferson, W.E.B. Du Bois, Carter G. Woodson and John Dewey. A nation reduced to a workforce will lack self- knowledge and will have trouble remaining a democracy. This old African American debate is the new American educational crisis. By Ron Stodghill Amistad. 258 pp. $26.99", "Title: Omarosa Manigault is in Trump\u2019s White House because of her loyalty. But what is she doing there? Content: Omarosa Manigault was incredulous. As she was leaving a gathering of African American members of Congress in the Oval Office, a group of reporters cornered her. For months, the Trump administration had sent strong signals that it would increase support to historically black colleges and universities. But President Trump\u2019s recent budget request contained no new cash for the schools. The reporters wanted Manigault \u2014 a top White House aide and one of Trump\u2019s most high-profile African American supporters \u2014 to explain what happened. \u201cEverything got cut, but did HBCUs get cut? No! . . . And I think that we should be applauded for that,\u201d Manigault said last week in a video posted on Politic365.com. \u201cSeriously. This is a lean budget. This is a very aggressive and lean budget, and yet, HBCUs were protected. \u201cCan a sister get props?\u201d That is the central question of Manigault\u2019s brief tenure as assistant to the president, as she has worked to bridge a divide between black America and the man she has long supported. **** Manigault, 43, is fiercely loyal to Donald Trump, whose decision to cast her as an alpha-female villain in the first season of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d more than a decade ago made her a reality television celebrity. Manigault also appears to have Trump\u2019s ear, and some black political observers see her as an important ally in a White House that is overwhelmingly white and male. But if her devotion explains how Manigault wound up in Trump\u2019s White House as the highest-ranking African American in the West Wing, it is far less easy to explain exactly what she\u2019s doing there. Some African American political insiders already have concluded that she is ineffective, and she is routinely derided on social media as simply providing cover for a president deeply unpopular with African Americans. Some black Republicans were particularly critical of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the HBCU initiative, which included a White House meeting with the school officials that some viewed as little more than a photo op for the president. \u201cShe raised expectations too high, and now it\u2019s turned into a negative,\u201d said Raynard Jackson, a longtime Republican strategist. \u201cThis shows a lack of political understanding. This is Politics 101.\u201d Manigault was among the first black people with any name recognition to publicly support Trump\u2019s presidential bid. She forcefully defended the New York businessman against criticism that he is racist and sexist. Manigault has granted some media interviews since arriving in Washington, but she canceled a meeting with The Washington Post and did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to questions about Manigault\u2019s official responsibilities, which so far have publicly been centered on issues relating to black America. None of those events has gone especially well. Shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration, Manigault said during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d that as director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison she was planning an event at the White House to celebrate Black History Month \u201cand it\u2019s going to be extravagant.\u201d On Feb. 1, she sat smiling next to Trump as he stumbled into a major gaffe, when he talked about abolitionist Frederick Douglass as if he were still alive. He said Douglass \u2014 who died in 1895 \u2014 \u201cis an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d When the black college presidents came to seek more funding on Feb. 27, new Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued a statement applauding HBCUs for being \u201creal pioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d Most of the colleges were founded to serve black students in response to Jim Crow segregation. And when Trump signed an executive order the next day that moved a task force on HBCUs from the Education Department to the White House, neither the order nor Trump\u2019s subsequent budget request included the 5 to 10 percent funding increases the college presidents sought. Far from the \u201cextravagant\u201d celebration Manigault touted, the administration\u2019s opening and closing events for Black History Month were met with ridicule. Jackson penneda blistering column in February for Black Press USA arguing that Manigault doesn\u2019t represent the Republican Party and isn\u2019t a credible go- between for the black community and Trump. Not only is she a recent convert to the GOP who does not know or appreciate black Republicans\u2019 struggle to make the party more inclusive, he argued, she doesn\u2019t have the relationships or the political acumen to be an effective advocate. \u201cI have a personal relationship with my physician, but I don\u2019t go to him for tax advice,\u201d Jackson said in an interview, rejecting the notion that her friendship with Trump makes her a powerful force for the black community. But because she is one of the few African Americans in Trump\u2019s immediate orbit, others caution against dismissing her. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we take Omarosa seriously, irrespective of how we feel about her,\u201d said Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor of public policy at Harvard. \u201cThe idea of having access to the White House in ways that people of color and civil rights agencies had under Obama \u2014 that\u2019s gone. She appears to be the black person who is closest to Donald Trump. So it\u2019s important to think very seriously about what she represents.\u201d The HBCU initiative was an opportunity for Manigault to showcase her influence within the Trump administration. Manigault and her supporters pointed to the fact that she attended three HBCUs as evidence of her passion concerning the issue and determination to fight for it. And it was a chance to show African Americans, who as a group voted solidly against Trump, that the new president could be more responsive to black colleges than former president Barack Obama, who oversaw a decline in funding for HBCUs during his first term. Morehouse College President John Silvanus Wilson, who served as executive director of a White House initiative to support the colleges under Obama, said the outcome of the meeting with Trump was underwhelming. \u201cThe funding that was implied by the warm greeting that we got in late February has yet to be realized,\u201d he said. But he described Manigault as an asset regardless. \u201cThe best advocacy HBCUs can have is someone who understands HBCUs in the inner circle of the president,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cOmarosa Manigault certainly understands the value of HBCUs, and she is certainly in the president\u2019s inner circle.\u201d But has Manigault oversold her influence with the administration? Right after the college presidents\u2019 visit, Manigault went on the Tom Joyner radio show and argued that under the Obama administration there had been \u201ca ton of unclaimed Pell Grants,\u201d a reference to a $10 million surplus in the subsidy program for students in financial need. She vowed that Trump would make that money available for students to \u201cfund their educations at historically black colleges and universities.\u201d Instead, the Trump budget seeks to spend nearly $4 million in other areas. **** Manigault doesn\u2019t publicly display a strong political or ideological identity; she was supporting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid before Trump announced his candidacy. Neither does she have any strong public ties to any individual charities or causes. She said in an episode of \u201cOprah: Where Are They Now?\u201d several years ago that, while on a humanitarian trip to Africa, she stared into the eyes of a child dying of AIDS and heard her calling to become ordained, which she achieved in 2011. She was an assistant minister at the Weller Street Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles when she left to join the Trump campaign last year. It is Trump himself who compels Manigault to his side. She asks people to look at her as evidence that the president is inclusive and wants to see minorities succeed. \u201cI am living the American Dream because of Donald Trump,\u201d she told the Hollywood Reporter in December. \u201cLook at my career, the wealth and exposure that I\u2019ve had; it\u2019s very difficult to make the argument that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like black people and black women.\u201d Black Republicans often face extra scrutiny because \u201cthey are minorities in their political community and political minorities in their racial community,\u201d Wright Rigueur said. She said black voters want to know: \u201cAre you representing our interests?\u201d That\u2019s an even bigger question for a black person supporting Trump, who, despite friendly relationships with individuals such as Manigault and boxing promoter Don King, has drawn scorn for his racially charged rhetoric against African Americans. Among the more sensational was Trump\u2019s longtime call for Obama to prove he is a U.S. citizen. (About two months before the election, Trump conceded that Obama was born in the United States.) Besides Manigault, the only high-ranking African American in the Trump administration is Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development. Armstrong Williams, another longtime Republican strategist and close adviser to Carson, said Manigault\u2019s influence goes beyond \u201cthe so-called black agenda.\u201d He said Manigault has input on press secretary Sean Spicer\u2019s daily briefings and that \u201cshe carries a lot of weight\u201d with candidates seeking ambassadorships. He also marveled at her relationship with and access to Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to watch,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNot only does he trust her, he\u2019s comfortable with her. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s like a daughter to him.\u201d Manigault\u2019s loyalty might be a more valuable currency to Trump than her experience, said Sophia Angeli Nelson, an author and political commentator who has worked in GOP administrations and in Congress. Of course, there are African American politicos and wonks who have more history with the Republican Party and its agenda. But in this White House, \u201cthey might last 10 minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may be more knowledgeable, but Trump wouldn\u2019t respect them and wouldn\u2019t listen to their opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Trump\u2019s world, loyalty means everything to him. And, if that\u2019s the case, Omarosa is the right person.\u201d When \u201cThe View\u2019s\u201d Sunny Hostin, who is Puerto Rican and African American, suggested to Manigault that Trump was \u201cusing you for optics,\u201d she retorted, \u201cNo one uses me.\u201d She then talked about growing up in public housing in Youngstown, Ohio. \u201cI grew up on welfare, on Section 8 housing. My father was killed when I was 7 years old,\u201d she said. She went to public schools and then Central State University and Payne Theological Seminary, both historically black schools in Wilberforce, Ohio. She also earned a master\u2019s degree and did additional graduate work toward a doctorate \u2014 but did not complete the degree \u2014 at another historically black college, Howard University. \u201cSo I earned my way to sit in the White House,\u201d Manigault said. \u201cNo one gave me anything, okay?\u201d Before being tapped for \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d she worked briefly in the White House during former president Bill Clinton\u2019s tenure. She received mixed reviews on her stints in low-level support positions in logistics and personnel, with some describing her as smart and hard-working and others saying she was disruptive and struggled with assigned tasks. It has been seven years since Manigault\u2019s last major role in a reality TV show, but her reality TV alter ego still makes cameo appearances from time to time. Last month, while shopping with friends at a mall in suburban Washington, she called store security to report that two \u201cfat ladies\u201d were harassing her. The following week,she had a heated, public argument with White House reporter April Ryan, a former friend who said Manigault was trying to smear her name by planting stories that she was being paid by the Clinton campaign. Allyson Carpenter, student government president at Howard, said that the public perception of Manigault doesn\u2019t match the person she has gotten to know during the past several months; they met at an event last year and have had numerous conversations since. Although Carpenter is highly critical of how the Trump administration has managed the HBCU initiative, she does not question Manigault\u2019s commitment to black schools. \u201cI think she\u2019s absolutely a genuine person,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cI think she really does care about the issues facing the black community.\u201d Michael Steele, the first black chairman of the Republican National Committee, serving from 2009 to 2011, said the episode with the historically black colleges was a \u201cclassic example\u201d of how the Trump administration is hurting itself by not connecting with more-experienced black Republicans. \u201cThe response from the HBCU presidents has been ho-hum, and some have referred to it as disappointing. That is not the kind of response you want after the president makes a big production around signing an order like that,\u201d Steele said. Last week, seven members of the Congressional Black Caucus met with Trump in the Oval Office. They told Trump they are concerned about his budget and policy positions, and they related how they don\u2019t appreciate his characterization of black communities as rife with crime and poverty. Sources said Manigault made it clear that the attendance \u2014 seven of 49 Black Caucus members \u2014 was irritatingly small. Trump tried to get the group to stand behind him at his desk. The lawmakers declined, ruining a potentially powerful photo op. _**Correction:** An earlier version of this story did not note that Manigault earned a master\u2019s degree at Howard University. She has pursued, but has not completed, a doctorate there. The story has been updated._", "Title: After White House courts HBCUs, budget disappoints school leaders Content: There is no mention in the budget of any federal investment in scholarships, technology or campus infrastructure for historically black colleges that leaders requested. And instead of expanding Pell grants for low-income students to cover summer courses as they had asked, the budget raids nearly $4 billion from the program\u2019s reserves. \u201cLess than three weeks ago, this administration claimed it is a priority to advocate for HBCUs but, after viewing this budget proposal, those calls ring hollow,\u201d Rep. Alma Adams (D-N.C.), a graduate of the largest HBCU, North Carolina A&T State University, said in a statement. Johnny Taylor, president of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, said the proposed appropriations could be a lot worse considering the total amount of cuts on the table for the Education Department. He said HBCU advocates had to fight the Obama administration for funding, and stressed that the lines of communication remain open with the current administration. \u201cThis is a process,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re already had phone calls with the administration to say that as we go into the specific lines of this budget, this is where we\u2019d like you to consider increases. This is only stage one.\u201d There was plenty of skepticism when the Trump administration made overtures toward black school leaders, including from students who questioned whether their college presidents were only being used for photo ops. It didn\u2019t help when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called historically black institutions \u201creal pioneers when it comes to school choice,\u201d a statement that HBCU advocates said ignored that the schools were a response to racist Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation. Despite the controversy, HBCU leaders remained focused on funding and held out hope that Trump\u2019s executive order regarding their schools would include some money. It did not. The order, signed in February, directs the White House initiative on HBCUs to operate from the White House instead of the Education Department. While some viewed the move as a signal that the more than 100 historically black schools were a priority for the administration, others said it was purely symbolic without monetary support. \u201cPresident Trump pledged to do more for HBCUs than any other president has done before. However, this budget is not reflective of that sentiment,\u201d Lomax said Thursday. \u201cWithout strong federal investments, President Trump\u2019s commitment to HBCUs and the rebuilding of African American communities will be promises unfulfilled.\u201d Historically black schools educated nearly 300,000 students in 2014, the latest figure available from the National Center for Education Statistics. Education Department data shows that three-quarters of all doctorates awarded to African Americans and 80 percent of black federal judges earned an undergraduate degree at historically black schools. \u201cYou can\u2019t just have a photo op for HBCUs and not create more funding for them,\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said on a call with reporters Thursday. \u201cThese schools have been under austerity for years, and if they\u2019re going to compete with others, they need more funding.\u201d", "Title: Students boo Betsy DeVos as commencement speaker at historically black university Content: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Graduating students booed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos as she spoke here Wednesday at Bethune-Cookman University\u2019s commencement, and many turned their backs to protest her appearance at the historically black school. The speech was part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing effort to reach out to historically black colleges and universities. Many students and alumni had objected to having DeVos as speaker in part because they said that outreach is an empty gesture or because they were offended by a remark she had made about historically black schools. But the university president defended DeVos\u2019s work as a philanthropist and her commitment to education. The speech attracted national attention at a time of heated debates over academic freedom. At many schools, protests have broken out when students objected to the views of controversial speakers, while others defended their right to voice unpopular views. Some saw the demonstrations against the speech as righteous indignation, while others saw a lack of civility. At Bethune-Cookman, alumni and others delivered petitions this week to administrators with thousands of signatures demanding that DeVos not be allowed to speak. The state\u2019s NAACP chapter called on the university president to resign, and a national teachers\u2019 union amplified the opposition. School leaders at the front of the room and some faculty applauded as he introduced DeVos to give her an honorary doctorate. But many students booed. When she began speaking, thanking Jackson, the room erupted with shouts. DeVos had to raise her voice as she thanked the moms attending the ceremony. About half of the 380 graduates turned their backs on her. \u201cChoose which way you want to go,\u201d Jackson said sternly as the disruptions continued. Many later sat down, but shouts continued as she spoke, saying that one of the hallmarks of higher education and democracy is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom they disagree. She also talked about the need to listen to other viewpoints and noted the increasing polarization evident on cable news and social media. \u201cLet\u2019s choose to hear one another out,\u201d she said at one point. When she spoke about how she would later visit the home and gravesite of the school\u2019s founder, civil rights activist and educator Mary McLeod Bethune, some in the crowd could be heard shouting, \u201cNo!\u201d DeVos told graduates: \u201cDr. Bethune believed students \u2014 you \u2014 had an unlimited potential to affect positive change, and with good reason. She\u2019d done it herself. \u201cAs you leave, each of you will be called to embody courage in different ways and to rise to different challenges. The way you answer those calls will determine not just the future of you and your homes, but of your communities, this great nation and your world. . . . \u201cThe natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger. But we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mind-set of grace. We must first listen, then speak \u2014 with humility \u2014 to genuinely hear the perspectives of those with whom we don\u2019t immediately or instinctively agree.\u201d Donjele Simpson, who graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology, was one of a dozen students who kept their backs turned on DeVos for almost all of her speech. \u201cShe made racist comments about HBCUs, she doesn\u2019t know anything about us, and she has the nerve to come down here and speak to us,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cAnd then she has the nerve to speak about Mary McLeod Bethune\u2019s legacy. What does she know about that?\u201d Earlier in the day, DeVos met with 12 student leaders, including Jacari Harris, a junior and former student body president, who said he was thrilled to have DeVos at his school. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s here,\u201d Harris said. \u201cShe\u2019s very transparent. She has a listening ear. We told her about some of the issues we are facing, about students who are single parents or come from single-parent families, even students who are homeless, and she agreed that we need to find a way to address all of this. She knows the need. It was a great dialogue.\u201d Tensions had been high for days. On Tuesday, protesters delivered petitions signed by thousands of people demanding that university leaders drop plans to have DeVos speak. \u201cI was in shock,\u201d said graduating student Jasmine Johnson, describing her reaction when she learned who would address her and her classmates. She said she doesn\u2019t think DeVos \u2014 a philanthropist and strong proponent of school choice, private and charter schools \u2014 understands public schools or historically black colleges. Jackson wrote in a letter to the campus community that a willingness to engage with varying viewpoints is a hallmark of higher education. \u201cI am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf our students are robbed of the opportunity to experience and interact with views that may be different from their own, then they will be tremendously less equipped for the demands of democratic citizenship.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Education Department, Elizabeth Hill, wrote in an email before the event that DeVos \u201cis looking forward to delivering the 2017 Commencement Address at Bethune-Cookman University and to engaging in productive dialogue with the students, faculty, and staff during her visit. \u201cCommencements are a time to celebrate the graduates and that\u2019s what she will be focused on while at B-CU on Wednesday.\u201d The commencement speech, DeVos\u2019s first as education secretary, is the latest effort by Trump and his administration to reach out to historically black colleges. Over the past several months, that outreach has been marked, including an Oval Office meeting with scores of college leaders. And it has at times been awkward, as when DeVos described such schools as pioneers of school choice \u2014 words that her opponents repeated often. She has also noted that African Americans had been systemically excluded from quality, or any, education at the time. On Friday, Trump seemed to signal that a key funding source for such schools might be unconstitutional, startling HBCU leaders who have relied on the funds for decades. On Sunday, he followed that with a statement of \u201cunwavering support\u201d for historically black colleges. So DeVos\u2019s speech at the Daytona Beach school came at a particularly fraught time. \u201cDo not use Bethune-Cookman as a photo op,\u201d he said Tuesday, shortly before delivering petitions to the administration building. \u201cCome to the table with something that is going to actually do something, in terms of policy, funding.\u201d The NAACP Florida State Conference called on DeVos to decline to give the speech. If she speaks and is given an honorary degree, it would be insulting to minorities, women and all communities of color, Adora Obi Nweze, the NAACP Florida State Conference president, said in a written statement. State and national education unions dove into the fight as well. People are outraged, said Fed Ingram, vice president of the Florida Education Association and a graduate of the school. Ninety percent of students who attend Bethune-Cookman were educated in public schools, he said. \u201cThis is a woman who throughout her \u2018career\u2019 has condemned public schools, has said these are dead-end schools.\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Tuesday, \u201cThe kids have worked really hard at a historically black college without the resources they need to get an education in a school that was created because of segregation and discrimination.\u201d The choice movement grew out of segregation, she said. \u201cThose of us who are neither students nor alums are just a megaphone,\u201d she said, for that message. It\u2019s a powerful megaphone: They said they had collected more than 50,000 digital signatures on the three petitions in a matter of days. Joe Petrock, chairman of the board of trustees for Bethune-Cookman, took the NAACP to task for calling for Jackson\u2019s ouster. \u201cThe NAACP has done some great, great things over the years, we can\u2019t take that away from them,\u201d Petrock said in a news conference before the ceremony. \u201cBut now I would challenge them to raise some funds to help support this school and our students.\u201d \u201cThe truth of the matter is that she is passionate about education,\u201d he said. Jackson told reporters at a news conference before the ceremony that he respects the right of his critics to disagree but that he believes the university was lucky to have DeVos as the speaker. \u201cCan you imagine how many institutions would love to have the secretary of education, the highest education officer in the land, be their commencement speaker? Can you imagine the doors this could open?\u201d Jackson said.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which runs the popular Mexican-inspired fast-food chain, has been mulling a new concept. The company filed an application to trademark the name \"Better Burger,\" a sign that Five Guys, Shake Shack, and the rest of the upper echelon of fast-food burger chains may soon have a new competitor. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The news, which was confirmed by Chipotle \u2014 \"it\u2019s a growth seed idea we are exploring,\" company spokesman Chris Arnold told Bloomberg on Wednesday \u2014 was met with excitement. Media outlets, rushing to cover the discovery, pondered how soon it will be before we see the first branch. Some even wondered if McDonald's, the largest hamburger slinger in the world, already had reason to worry. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But it also raised an important question: Why is Chipotle directing its attention to the hamburger scene, one of the most saturated in the American food industry? On the surface, the move is a bit perplexing. The market for burger chains is almost four times the size of the market for Mexican fare, according to data from market research firm Technomic. There's a lot more money being spent on ground beef patties, but there isn't much wiggle room for growth. McDonald's, which has struggled to woo customers in recent years, can attest. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But zoom into the market for fancier burger chains, and a different story emerges. \"Once you look more deeply, you realize that it actually makes a lot of sense,\" said Darren Tristano, who is the president of Technomic. Tristano points out that the fast-casual burger category, which includes the likes of Shake Shack, is growing quickly. What's more, it still represents a small portion of the overall burger market. \"The fast-casual burger category grew at nearly 16 percent last year,\" he said. \"If you looked at the overall burger market, you would see that fast casual only represents 5 to 7 percent of it.\" In that light, the news makes a bit more sense. Chipotle isn't thinking about the McDonald's core customer; it's dreaming of all the hamburger lovers out there who rarely, if ever, eat Big Macs. Of course, in order to be successful, \"Better Burger,\" if it ever comes to be, will have to distinguish itself from a field of suitable competitors. How it will do that remains unclear \u2014 we don't, after all, know much (or anything, really) about Chipotle's plans, other than what can be extrapolated from its current business model and gleaned from the name it recently filed a trademark for. But it's easy enough to guess. The company's mission to serve food with integrity, which it has clung to even when it has come at the expense of its business, will likely play a role. So, too, might the sort of food experience that has defined not only Chipotle, but ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale, its two much smaller sister brands. That would mean a narrow menu, with quality ingredients and a high level of customization. It also could mean \"Better Burger\" won't experiment with breakfast or dessert. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Food aside, there's a suspicion a Chipotle-backed hamburger joint might look to adult beverages for some edge. Namely, an alcoholic refreshment that's often paired with hamburgers. \"Now that they're selling hand-shaken margaritas at Chipotle, who knows? Maybe Better Burger will sell local craft beer,\" said Tristano. \"I certainly wouldn't be surprised.\" **More from Wonkblog:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Coca-Cola\u2019s clever new trick *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The magical thing eating chocolate does to your brain *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The most depressing thing about how Donald Trump orders his steak *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Consumer Reports: McDonald\u2019s burger ranked worst in the U.S. Content: Some major fast-food chains \u2014 McDonald\u2019s, KFC, Taco Bell \u2014 may find the latest Consumer Reports fast-food survey hard to swallow. According to the survey, released on Wednesday, more than 30,000 Consumer Reports subscribers say these restaurants\u2019 signature items are the worst in their categories: McDonald\u2019s has the worst burger; KFC has the worst chicken; and Taco Bell has the worst burrito. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Consumer Reports surveyed 32,405 subscribers about their experiences at 65 fast-food and fast-casual chains. This is what they were asked: \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10, from least delicious to most delicious you\u2019ve ever eaten, how would you rate the taste\u201d of their signature dishes? Habit Burger Grill, In-n-Out and Five Guys Burgers received the highest rating for their burgers, 8.1, 8.0 and 7.9 respectively. Meanwhile, McDonald\u2019s scored a paltry 5.8 rating. **McDonald\u2019s: Changing menu adds pressure to prep kitchen** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday McDonald\u2019s has been busy changing its menu in an effort to attract more customers. But despite the novelty items the company promoted in 2013 \u2014 Fish McBites in February, McWraps in March, Mighty Wings in September, etc. \u2014 the company\u2019s U.S. sales dropped 0.2 percent last year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday During a conference call with investors, McDonald\u2019s chief financial officer Peter Bensen said the company \u201cprobably did things a little bit too quickly\u201d in terms of introducing those new menu items. The constant changes and bold experiments with the menu put pressure to the restaurants\u2019 kitchens, which sometimes took too long to fill orders. But new items introduced this year will be welcomed by the chain\u2019s new kitchen equipment. Prep tables will be replaced with larger surfaces that are able to hold more sauces and ingredients. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday In 2014, Bensen said, the company will \u201crefocus the core,\u201d including tried-and-true favorites such as the Big Mac, Chicken McNuggets and the Quarter Pounder, as well as breakfast. **Consumer searches for healthier choices** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Research shows Americans are spending $683.4 billion a year dining out, and they are also demanding better food quality and greater variety from restaurants to make sure their money is well spent. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday When deciding where to dine, consumers are giving more consideration to food quality, according to the Consumer Reports survey. The restaurant\u2019s location is less important than it was in 2011, when the group last conducted the survey. Diners today are more willing to go out of their way and find tasty meals that can be customized. \u201cFast-casual dining in places like Chipotle and Panda Express lets the consumer guide the staff to prepare their meal just the way they like it,\u201d Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, a food-service consulting firm, said in the report. While many of the traditional chains have lagged in offering higher-quality ingredients, he said, some food chains \u2014 including Chipotle, Noodles & Company and Panera \u2014 have been offering meat raised without using antibiotics in animal feed, a feature that attracts consumers searching for healthier options. **Fast-food alternatives: fast-casual restaurants** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Chipotle was rated by readers as their top fast-casual restaurant. (Fast-casual restaurants usually serve higher-quality, higher-priced fast food.) According to the survey, McAlister\u2019s Deli gets the award for most improved as the chain\u2019s score increased significantly since the 2011 report. Top fast-casual restaurants: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday", "Title: The Chipotle effect: Why America is obsessed with fast casual food Content: Fast casual food is so hot right now. The market for fast casual food, which is almost but not quite fast food (I'll get to that in a second), has grown by 550 percent since 1999, more than ten times the growth seen in the fast food industry over the same period, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Chipotle, likely the best known purveyor of the category, has seen its sales more than quadruple during that time; Panera, another oft-used example, has watched its sales more than triple; and Shake Shack, the hamburger joint du jour, has done so well that it just went public despite operating only 36 outlets. Americans spent more than $21 billion at fast casual restaurants last year, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor, which is not bad, considering that the category is only loosely defined at best. Everyone agrees that fast casual is the next big thing, but it's surprisingly hard to define what it is exactly. What makes fast casual food fast causal\u2014and not simply fast food? And at what point do we draw the line between fast casual placesand the likes of Applebee's and Chili's, which have table service, but also takeout? The answer might simply depend on whom you ask. \"It's all very confusing,\"said Darren Tristano, executive vice president of Technomic, an industry research firm. \"The truth is that no one really has the 'right' answer.\" Most industry experts can agree that an essential component of the fast casual category is its price point, which ranges from $9 to $13 dollars per receipt, compared to an average ticket closer to $5 for fast food restaurants. Fast casual restaurants also, ideally, earn less than 50 percent of their business from full service sit down meals. Otherwise they too closely resemble casual dining restaurants, like Applebee's. But there's a lot of other criteria. By Technomic's estimation, there are at least 10 different markers of restaurants that fall within the category: the quality of the food, the use of better ingredients, food that is wholesome, a perception of freshness, first-rate decor, fair pricing, fast service, friendly employees, flexible offerings, and a full view of how the food is prepared. But there are disagreements. Euronomitor, for instance, considers Buffalo Wild Wings to be a fast casual restaurant. Technomic, meanwhile, does not, because of the chain's growing full-service, sit-down business. In lieu of a rigid understanding, the category is perhaps best defined by those restaurants that best exemplify its essence. And few, if any, chain is more closely aligned with the concept than is Chipotle. \"Chipotle is really the one that comes to mind,\" said Tristano. \"Not just because of the format, but because of the food and mission. It has everything that fast casual means today.\" The Mexican chain has come to embody not only the present but also the future of fast casual sector. Chipotle both has satisfied all of the conventional qualities of the category\u2014food quality, freshness, efficiency, transparency, etc\u2014and has managed to etch out a new standard that is increasingly central to the category: sustainability. Other fast casual chains, including Panera, seem to be following suit. Panera has taken steps to be more environmentally friendly, including a redesign of all of its packaging last year to promote recycling. \"What consumers are looking for is the best value proposition,\" said Bonnie Riggs, an industry analyst with NPD group. \"And value doesn't mean the cheapest price.\" The origins of the fast casual category date back to the early 1990s, when chains like Fuddruckers and Au Bon Pain introduced a new, slightly more upscale version of the otherwise supremely cheap and quick options available at competitors like McDonald's and Subway. What separated those pioneers from the rest of the fast food industry was little more than a commitment to an elevated experience in food and atmosphere. \"What we saw early on with fast casual was mainly an emphasis on offering a better product,\" said Tristano. \"It was the price point, but also the food quality, the ingredients, the experience.\" The name Fuddruckers and the word pioneer might sound strange when paired together, but that first generation was a food movement in its infancy, pushing consumer demands for better food and better value to only modest ends. Over the years, the fast casual category has evolved to accommodate a heightened interest in health, sourcing, ethics, and value, all of which have coalesced in the likes of Chipotle. \"We noticed this incredible thing at the start of the recession,\" said Riggs.\" Traffic in the restaurant industry was negative for two years in a row, which we had never seen before. Quick service was flat; full service was flat. But fast casual was growing in the double digits even during the height of the recession.\" As millennials, who make up the biggest demographic of fast casual fans **,** find themselves more strapped for time and less willing to eat fast food, which they view as unhealthy, the trend will only likely continue. NPD group estimates that fast casual will grow in the double digits through 2022, while the rest of the restaurant industry will eek out growth rates of around half a percentage point. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"Everybody in the world is talking about fast casual,\" Riggs said. \"It just has a such a broad appeal.\" Few understand the appeal of the fast casual model better than the fast food industry, which has suffered mightily on the heels of the success of its better dressed sibling. \"When the overall market isn't growing, it means stealing customers from everyone else,\" said Riggs. The category now controls 5 percent of all restaurant traffic, up from 1 percent in 2000. Rather than waiting around while marginally more upscale food joints pluck customers, the fast food industry has responded by mimicking the competition. McDonald's recently introduced a new build-your-own-burger experience; Wendy's has been remodeling its restaurants in an effort to make them more comfortable; and Subway has both pushed a healthy narrative and incorporated ingredients like avocado that tend to be viewed as higher end offerings. The results have been mixed at best so far, but it's hard to view the fast food industry's moves as anything more than flattery. At the very least, McDonald's willingness to forgo its core business to mimic the likes of Shake Shack points to a future in which the quick service food industry looks a lot more like Chipotle and a lot less like, well, McDonald's. \"I think you're going to see less and less distinction over time as more fast food concepts shift towards the fast casual model,\" Tristano said. \"If you think it's hard to tell what makes a restaurant fast casual today, it's only going to more confusing.\"", "Title: The Chipotle effect: Why America is obsessed with fast casual food Content: Fast casual food is so hot right now.

At the very least, McDonald's willingness to forgo its core business to mimic the likes of Shake Shack points to a future in which the quick service food industry looks a lot more like Chipotle and a lot less like, well, McDonald's. \"I think you're going to see less and less distinction over time as more fast food concepts shift towards the fast casual model,\" Tristano said. \"If you think it's hard to tell what makes a restaurant fast casual today, it's only going to more confusing.\"", "Title: How Chipotle is forcing sit-down chains like Olive Garden to rethink lunch Content: For years, casual restaurants such as Olive Garden and Buffalo Wild Wings have been battling for your dinnertime dollars, to be the place where you take the kids for a heaping bowl of spaghetti on their birthday or where you slurp beers with your buddies on game night. But now these sit-down restaurant chains are hungry for your lunch order, too. Olive Garden is trying to draw a bigger lunchtime crowd by changing up its signature lunch menu offering\u2014a soup, salad and breadsticks meal\u2014with trendy combo options such as risotto balls or parmesan-roasted asparagus. Red Robin, a full-service burger chain with 500 restaurants, is racing to open outposts of its fast-casual spin-off, Burger Works, in urban locations with big lunchtime crowds. Cracker Barrel is developing a fast-casual concept that will likely debut by July 2016, while Romano\u2019s Macaroni Grill is promising guests that orders from its new takeaway lunch counter will be filled in seven minutes or the meal is free. The industry is struggling to turnaround years of decline as time-strapped customers opt for fast-casual joints such as Chipotle and Panera Bread and remain wary of an outing that feels like an indulgence. According to research firm Technomic, sales were up just 1.9 percent at casual dining restaurants open more than a year in the third quarter, compared to a 7.9 percent increase in the fast-casual category and a 2 percent increase in the restaurant industry overall. \u201cThe worst place to be in the restaurant industry in the United States today is to be a full-service restaurant with average check size of less than $20,\u201d said Aaron Allen, a restaurant industry consultant. That\u2019s because diners have been flocking to fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle where they can get meals that are similar in price and quality to those at casual dining chains, but can get in and out of the restaurant much faster. Wall Street has noted diners\u2019 enthusiasm: Chains such as Shake Shack, Zoe\u2019s Kitchen and El Pollo Loco saw their stock sizzle in recent public trading debuts. Chipotle, the shining star of the fast-casual category, has seen its stock soar nearly 600 percent in the last five years as it has repeatedly delivered stratospheric growth in sales at restaurants open more than a year. Fast-casual restaurants have taken advantage of one of the weaknesses of their sit-down dining counterparts. \u201cI might say fast-casual exists because full-service doesn\u2019t align very well with lunch during the week,\u201d said Darren Tristano, a restaurant industry analyst with Technomic. \u201cMonday through Friday, getting out of a full-service restaurant in under an hour is difficult.\u201d Now, sit-down chains are looking for new ways to adapt to that problem. Currently, only 20 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings\u2019 business comes during the lunch-time rush. The chain will try to change that with a marketing blitz starting in April that will trumpet quick-to-prepare menu items such as wings, salads, sandwiches, and \u201cBuffalitos,\u201d a taco-like concoction. It will also work to train the kitchen staff to move speedily. Hopefully, diners will be impressed if they are moved through the restaurant in 30 to 40 minutes, said Sally Smith, chief executive of Buffalo Wild Wings. \u201cLunch is really where we have opportunity and availability at our restaurants,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe\u2019re not at capacity for lunch.\u201d Red Robin, too, is keenly aware of how much time is a factor in winning lunch business. Steve Carley, the gourmet burger chain\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIn our research, we\u2019ve found that guests typically have the following conversation: They look at their pals for lunch and say, \u2018What do you want to do for lunch?\u2019 And the next question is, \u2018Well, how much time do we have?\u2019\u201d If it was less than 25 minutes \u2014 as it often is for desk jockeys \u2014 diners don\u2019t even consider full-service restaurants like Red Robin. \u201cBeing held hostage by the check, we know that\u2019s a big pain point for guests,\u201d Carley said. \u201cAnd fast-casual solves that problem.\u201d That\u2019s where Burger Works comes in. The restaurants are smaller than traditional Red Robin restaurants and feature only a selection from the restaurant\u2019s extensive menu. So far, Burger Works have opened in Denver, Chicago and the District, and Carley expects he will look to add more urban markets in the future. Red Robin is trying to address the speed issue in its big-box restaurants with tabletop tablet computers that allow customers to pay instantly without having to wait for a server\u2019s assistance. Digital technology is also central to Olive Garden\u2019s strategy for luring a bigger lunch time crowd. The Italian restaurant\u2019s to-go sales in the most recent quarter were up 15 percent over the previous year, strong growth that the company attributes to the launch of its online ordering platform in July and mobile ordering capability in November. The push by casual dining restaurants to steal lunch money from their fast- casual rivals is hardly a sure thing. Red Lobster, for example, tried a fast- casual concept called Seaside Express back in 2013 but ultimately discontinued the effort, likely a sign that it wasn\u2019t gaining traction. Fast-food restaurants, which are also under siege from the fast-casual category, have tried to experiment with more upscale items, such as when Taco Bell added its Cantina Bell menu to better compete with Chipotle. They soon reworked that offering to become the Cantina Power menu, which focuses on protein-heavy dishes, a move that suggests that cribbing directly from Chipotle\u2019s playbook wasn\u2019t a success for them. And, Allen warns, innovation simply does not seem to be in the DNA of many of the casual dining chains, which often feel dated the moment you set foot in the door. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of state of the art, 1993,\u201d Allen said."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses Chipotle's new burger concept and its potential impact on the fast-food industry, including potential competitors.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most comprehensive information about Chipotle's new burger concept, including its potential impact on the market and competitors.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The company filed an application to trademark the name 'Better Burger,' a sign that Five Guys, Shake Shack, and the rest of the upper echelon of fast-food burger chains may soon have a new competitor."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the performance of various fast-food chains, including McDonald's, which could be a potential competitor for Chipotle's new burger concept.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage does not directly discuss Chipotle's new burger concept, it provides relevant context about the performance of potential competitors in the fast-food industry.", "direct_answer_sentence": "McDonald\u2019s has been busy changing its menu in an effort to attract more customers."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the shift in the restaurant industry towards fast-casual concepts, like Chipotle's, and the impact on traditional sit-down chains.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage does not directly discuss Chipotle's new burger concept, it provides relevant context about the broader industry trends that could influence its success.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The industry is struggling to turnaround years of decline as time-strapped customers opt for fast-casual joints such as Chipotle and Panera Bread and remain wary of an outing that feels like an indulgence."}, {"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the growth of the fast-casual food market, including Chipotle's success, but does not directly address the new burger concept.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage provides relevant background information about the fast-casual food market, it does not directly address the query about Chipotle's new burger concept.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Chipotle, likely the best known purveyor of the category, has seen its sales more than quadruple during that time."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage is identical to passage 3 and therefore has the same relevance to the query.", "listwise_reason": "As this passage is identical to passage 3, it provides the same level of relevance and context to the query.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Chipotle, likely the best known purveyor of the category, has seen its sales more than quadruple during that time."}]}, "scores": [17.36389923095703, 14.763099670410156, 14.541000366210938, 14.540999412536621, 14.451199531555176]}

Then another. Within minutes, a prominent death-with-dignity advocate was shot dead along with his ailing wife in an assisted living center in Florida. The couple was found at the Solaris HealthCare Charlotte Harbor center in Port Charlotte, Fla. Charlotte County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokesman Skip Conroy said the case is being investigated as a murder-suicide. But those who knew the Kavanaughs said it may have been their only option. \u201cIt was a rational suicide,\u201d Final Exit Network President Janis Landis told The Washington Post. \u201cBoth of them made this decision. It was not murder.\u201d Fellow members of the Final Exit Network said Kavanaugh had recently pulled away from his own life to stay by his wife\u2019s side as she battled a degenerative brain disease. \u201cHe had really disengaged from everything else,\u201d Landis said. \u201cHe was at her side every day, all day. He hadn\u2019t spent a night away from home since she got the diagnosis.\u201d Landis, the group\u2019s president, said several members knew what the Kavanaughs had been going through but none knew how bad it had gotten. \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised that both of them felt strongly about their right to decide the timing and manner of their deaths when the quality of their lives became unacceptable,\u201d she said. Landis noted that, as far as she knew, no one was aware of the couple\u2019s plan. Authorities have not yet released a possible motive in the Kavanaughs\u2019 case. Just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, authorities were called to the Solaris HealthCare Charlotte Harbor center, where they found the couple. Both had been shot and killed. After the couple\u2019s deaths, friends, neighbors and fellow right-to-die advocates started to speak out about the violent and heart-wrenching scene. People in the pair\u2019s Punta Gorda community depicted a heartbreaking image of an elderly husband who was desperate to help the love of his life. \u201cHe was in good shape, good health; I can\u2019t imagine why this horrible thing happened,\u201d Gale Petrillo told WZVN. \u201cI\u2019m stunned. It\u2019s horrific. Sometimes we could hear him say, \u2018Barbara, but I\u2019m only trying to help. I\u2019m only trying to help.\u2019 \u201d But another friend, Ted Goodwin, said Kavanaugh had started having health issues, which, Goodwin thought, may have led to a deadly decision. \u201cThey were with each other constantly over a lifetime,\u201d he told the news station. \u201cMy guess is they had determined to go together. While my heart is breaking on one hand, I have to honor the fact they went on their terms.\u201d Frank Kavanaugh was retired after a long teaching career at the George Washington University School of Medicine, according to his Final Exit Network biography. The school, however, could not immediately verify his employment history. \u201cWith my 23 years in the medical center, I saw the wonderful things that we did in intervening in people\u2019s lives and making them better \u2014 and, unfortunately, I also saw how when we could not make them any better we too often walked away from them at the most critical time in their lives,\u201d he said in 2014, adding that he didn\u2019t think the medical profession was responding in the right way. \u201cLots of emphasis on keeping people alive; not enough on what we could call \u2018end-of-life care\u2019 or really \u2018aid-in-dying.\u2019 \u201d In recent years, there has been an emotional push from right-to-die advocates such as Kavanaugh to urge states to adopt laws that would allow terminally ill patients to choose how they want to go. That same year, a Pew Research survey showed that public opinion was split, with 47 percent of U.S. adults supporting the practice and 49 percent opposing it. A Gallup poll that year suggested that results varied according to how the question was presented: Some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of allowing physicians to \u201cend the patient\u2019s life by some painless means,\u201d but only 51 percent were in support of allowing doctors to help a patient \u201ccommit suicide.\u201d Since then, some things have started to change. Last year, California Gov. Jerry Brown (D) signed a measure to legalize physician-assisted suicide in the state. A poll at the time showed a 10-point rise in support from 2014 \u2014 an increase \u201cconsistent with changing attitudes related to a number of once-controversial social issues,\u201d according to Gallup. But not everyone agrees with doctor-assisted suicide \u2014 and some opponents have made their opinions known. Amid the debate in California, Stephanie Packer, who has been battling her own terminal illness, said she worried that the option to die would prevent people from trying to find a way to live. The American Medical Association, it seems, agrees. \u201cInstead of participating in assisted suicide, physicians must aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the end of life,\u201d the organization said in its opinion on physician-assisted suicide. \u201cPatients should not be abandoned once it is determined that cure is impossible.\u201d The deaths in Florida this week have already prompted further discussion about the death-with-dignity debate. Landis, the Final Exit Network president, drew parallels between the Kavanaughs\u2019 deaths and a time before abortion was legal, when some women would use coat hangers to perform their own procedures. \u201cIn an ideal word,\u201d she said, \u201cpeople would not have to resort to such violent means.\u201d", "Title: \u2018Death With Dignity\u2019 laws are proposed, bringing national debate to D.C. and Md. Content: A national discussion over whether the terminally ill should be permitted to end their lives appears to be headed to the District and Maryland, where lawmakers are proposing \u201cDeath With Dignity\u201d laws as more than a dozen other states wrestle with the issue. Five states currently permit \u201caid in dying,\u201d as advocates prefer to call laws that have commonly been referred to as physician-assisted suicide. Voters in Oregon and Washington passed ballot measures allowing the practice, while legislators in Vermont and judges in Montana and New Mexico have authorized it. D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) introduced her \u201cDeath with Dignity Act of 2015\u201d on Wednesday. In Maryland, Sen. Ronald N. Young (D-Frederick) said Thursday he is in the process of drafting a bill, also titled \u201cDeath With Dignity,\u201d and plans to introduce the measure in the coming weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s allowing the person to say, \u2018I\u2019m in pain, I\u2019m in sound mind, and I don\u2019t want to go on like this,\u2019 \u201d Young said. The Death With Dignity campaign won national attention last year thanks to the efforts of 29-year-old Brittany Maynard, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, to advocate for laws allowing mentally competent, terminally ill adults to seek medical assistance in dying. Maynard died Nov. 1 after moving from California to Oregon to take advantage of that state\u2019s Death With Dignity law. \u201cEveryone agrees that Brittany Maynard was a game-changing advocate,\u201d said Anne Singer, a spokeswoman for Compassion and Choices, a Colorado-based group that offers counseling to terminally ill Americans and advocates for state aid-in-dying laws. Besides D.C. and Maryland, aid-in-dying legislation is expected to be introduced or debated in at least 15 statehouses this year, Singer said. The issue was highlighted closer to Washington after the death of John B. Rehm, a lawyer who had suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease. His wife, National Public Radio host Diane Rehm, described how her husband wished to die after his illness progressed to the point that he could no longer use his limbs or perform basic functions without assistance. Rehm\u2019s doctor, citing Maryland law, declined to help his patient end his life, according to his wife\u2019s accounts. Rehm chose to stop eating or drinking until he died several days later, on June 23. Cheh said Maynard\u2019s and Rehm\u2019s deaths hadn\u2019t led her to introduce her bill. Rather, she said, she has contemplated pursuing such a measure for years but held back while the council took up other hot-button issues. \u201cI think the time is right,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are some things that are momentous and are deserving of singular attention. . . . This is something we ought to take up as a community.\u201d Young said Maynard\u2019s plight had an impression on him, as well as the sentiments of his constituents. \u201cI know a lot of people who have said, \u2018I want that option,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI would just like to take the stigma off of it.\u201d Young said he\u2019s gotten a \u201ctremendous response\u201d in support of the bill since announcing his intentions earlier this week. He said he has also encountered some opposition, mainly from devout Catholics. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops spoke out against physician-assisted suicide in 2011, saying legalization would prompt a \u201cradical change\u201d in society. \u201cJewish and Christian moral traditions have long rejected the idea of assisting in another\u2019s suicide,\u201d the bishops said. \u201cCatholic teaching views suicide as a grave offense against love of self, one that also breaks the bonds of love and solidarity with family, friends, and God.\u201d The Archdiocese of Washington did not respond to requests for comment Thursday on the local proposals. Cardinal Donald W. Wuerl previously spoke out on the subject in 1999 while serving as bishop of Pittsburgh, calling assisted- suicide laws part of a \u201ceugenic philosophy\u201d that \u201conly adds to the problems of our society, already mired in violence and death.\u201d While the practice has been called \u201cassisted suicide\u201d in common parlance, advocates avoid the term as they have sought to draw a sharp distinction between the suicides of those who are physically healthy but mentally ill and the decisions of people who are mentally competent and wish to hasten an impending death. Cheh\u2019s bill would allow patients with illnesses likely to result in death within six months to seek medication to end their lives. Two physicians would have to consent to dispensing the life-ending drugs after certifying the patient\u2019s terminal prognosis and mental competency. The bill is modeled on Oregon\u2019s law, which took effect in 1997. Cheh said the experience there has given her confidence that her bill is well-crafted. \u201cVery few people have actually used it,\u201d she said, adding that not all of those patients who gain authorization end up hastening their deaths. It is not clear how quickly or how far each bill might advance. Young said he has gotten supportive signals from Senate leadership but said his discussions about its prospects have been cursory. Incoming Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who is Catholic, told an archdiocesan newspaper in October that he would oppose attempts to legalize aid-in-dying. \u201cI believe a physician\u2019s role is to save lives, not terminate them,\u201d he told the Catholic Standard. The future of Cheh\u2019s bill will largely depend on the wishes of the colleague who chairs the committee to which it is referred. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said he is likely to refer the bill to the Committee on Judiciary and Public Safety, which is chaired by Kenyan R. McDuffie (D-Ward 5). McDuffie said Thursday he had yet to review Cheh\u2019s bill and had no immediate reaction to it. What is clear is that the Death With Dignity debate stands to be less strident in D.C., whose liberal lawmakers have long pushed the envelope on social issues that have been deeply divisive elsewhere in the country. The District has successfully legalized same-sex marriage, but Capitol Hill lawmakers have balked at attempts to allow marijuana possession or use public funds to fund abortions for low-income women. \u201cIn terms of occupying the council, I wouldn\u2019t put it in the same league as marriage equality,\u201d an issue that drew hundreds of witnesses to hearings, Mendelson said. \u201cThis is not a jurisdiction that gets all twisted up over a lot of these social issues.\u201d The debate carries an additional dimension in the District, where local laws are subject to congressional review. Mendelson, currently in a standoff with Capitol Hill Republicans over marijuana legalization, declined to speculate on how Congress might react to an aid-in-dying bill.", "Title: Murder-suicide disturbing trend among the elderly Content: KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Golden years? Not every senior citizen thinks so. Murder-suicide is occurring with alarming frequency among the elderly. This week a 93-year-old man reportedly stabbed his 95-year-old wife to death early Wednesday morning in their south Kansas City, Mo. home. Then he tried to stab himself in the chest, but failed to kill himself and woke up in the hospital. Harry Irwin told a paramedic, \u201cYes, I killed her. And then killed myself. Why am I still awake?\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University This did not appear to be a mercy killing, intended to relieve pain and suffering. Irwin told a nurse his wife, Grace Irwin, had been \u201carguing and screaming at him all night,\u201d and he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. The couple\u2019s 70th wedding anniversary was last month. They have seven children who live in the area. The Jackson County prosecutor has charged Harry Irwin with second-degree murder. \u201cNo victim deserves someone else deciding when they will die,\u201d Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a statement released to the media. The Kansas City murder-attempted suicide is hardly an isolated incident. Two weeks ago Roy Boldt, 81, visited his wife at a Tequesta, Fla. nursing home. He shot and killed 75-year-old Virginia Boldt and then turned the gun on himself. Family members told a reporter the couple had known each other since she was 5 and he was 12-years-old. *[WSU]: Wayne State University In October James Stanton, 75, shot his wife, Patricia Stanton, 68, during a visit to the Jacksonville, Fla. inpatient rehabilitation facility where she had been admitted after suffering injuries from a fall. She survived the murder attempt, but he died after shooting himself at the scene. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Earlier this year in the Washington, D.C. area, Charles D. Snelling killed his wife and then himself a week after their 61st wedding anniversary. Snelling, who\u2019d written an essay for The New York Times on the love story he shared with his wife, had once chaired the authority overseeing Reagan and Dulles airports and the construction of Metro\u2019s new $6 billion Silver Line. Adrienne Snelling, a fine arts photographer, had suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease for years, and her condition had deteriorated. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Adrienne explained, in a letter written three years earlier to the couple\u2019s children, \u201cWe are both in agreement that neither one of us wants to live after all reasonable hope for a good life is over.\u201d \u201cMight more support have made a difference? Or did he just not want to go on without her?\u201d wrote Paula Spencer Scott on Caring.com about the Snellings. Murder-suicides among people 55 and older have increased from 21 percent in 2002 to 25 percent in 2011 of the total murder-suicides in the United States, according to the Violence Policy Center. *[WSU]: Wayne State University A murder-suicide involving an elderly couple occurs about every two weeks in Florida, Donna Cohen, a professor at the University of South Florida, told the Kansas City Star. The author of several scholarly research articles on the topic, Cohen estimates that 20 older Americans die _each week_ as the result of murder-suicide. *[WSU]: Wayne State University The typical case? A depressed, controlling husband who shoots his ailing wife \u2014 without her permission, according to Cohen. For most, this isn\u2019t the romanticized Romeo and Juliet suicide pact with the couple agreeing on the time and place to ride off into the sunset together. Although the Snellings might have agreed to end it together, the majority of murder-suicides among older couples are not suicide pacts, reports Sonia Salari, a sociologist at the University of Utah. Salari analyzed data from 225 murder-suicides in which one member was age 60 or older. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Experts say depression, exhaustion and isolation all play a role; often, it\u2019s men who are thrust into the unfamiliar role of caregiver. They may suffer from undiagnosed clinical depression. And if they learn their own health problems put them at risk of dying before their spouses, they may believe that no one else can take care of their wives as well as they can. And they don\u2019t bother asking their wives for permission; in fact, the spouse is often unaware of the plan \u2014 and probably wouldn\u2019t agree to it. Grace Irwin\u2019s brother, Salvatore Privitera, told the Kansas City Star, \u201cMy sister was very much interested in living,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very content.\u201d _To get help: Ask your doctor or mental health professional or visit the Web site ofThe Institute on Aging in San Francisco, which offers a Center for Elderly Suicide Prevention & Grief Counseling.

D.C. lawmakers on Friday held a hearing on the Death With Dignity Act of 2015, which would authorize doctors to prescribe lethal medication to patients who have been given six months or less to live and wish to die on their own terms. The bill, introduced by \u00adD.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), is modeled on the assisted-suicide law in Oregon, where more than 850 terminally ill patients have taken their lives in the 18 years since the statute was passed. As in Oregon, the District\u2019s bill would not require a physician\u2019s supervision during the administration of the lethal medication. But it would require the patient to self-administer the drug, typically by mouth. Two doctors would also be required to determine that a patient qualifies as terminally ill and is both \u201ccapable\u201d and not \u201csuffering from a psychiatric or psychological disorder or depression causing impaired judgement.\u201d Legislators have proposed similar laws in 24 states this year, and advocates say legislation is close to passage in California and New Jersey. The D.C. Council is not expected to vote before the fall. In addition to Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico all allow some kind of aid in dying for terminally ill patients. The issue has sparked fierce national debate, which translated into emotional \u2014 and sometimes angry \u2014 testimony inside D.C. Council chambers Friday. The hours-long hearing drew testimony from dozens of witnesses, including the widower of Brittany Maynard, who garnered national headlines last year as a 29-year-old brain cancer patient who opted to end her life. Supporters of the bill said they fear dying in horrific pain or being deprived of the right to choose their fate. Opponents said they feared murders or coercion for the sake of inheritance, a slippery slope of approved deaths, and broader abuse. \u201cThere is a lot of passion on both sides,\u201d said Mickey \u00adMacIntyre, the chief program officer at Compassion and Choices, an advocacy group that supports the legislation. Proponents of the D.C. bill, including Susan Farris, who has Stage 4 HER2-positive breast cancer, cast the law as \u201ca way out\u201d for the terminally ill and a way for patients to exercise an autonomous and deeply personal choice. \u201cI have no interest in dying. I\u2019m fighting like hell to stay alive,\u201d Farris said. \u201cHowever I don\u2019t want to suffer.\u201d Critics of the legislation included a coalition of advocates for the disabled, who wore red T-shirts reading \u201cNo D.C. suicide\u201d and said they feared the legislation could pressure disabled people to opt for death in an effort to unburden their families. D.C. Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt, one of the most prominent opponents to testify against the legislation, said the bill \u201ccatapults the District into uncharted territory that we are not prepared to navigate.\u201d She argued that the legislation leaves many issues undefined, including the type of medication to be administered and the qualifications a doctor would need to determine a patient\u2019s prognosis and mental health. Noting that the bill does not require a physician to be in attendance at the time of death, Nesbitt also questioned whether a patient could choose to die in a public place in a city that \u201cattracts 19 million tourists a year.\u201d The health director\u2019s testimony provoked a tense, nearly half-hour exchange with Cheh, who bombarded Nesbitt with questions about her definition of suicide and the reliability of terminal prognoses. Like other D.C. laws, the Death with Dignity Act would ultimately be subject to congressional approval if passed by the council and signed by the mayor. It\u2019s unclear which, if any, members of the overwhelmingly liberal council would oppose the bill. Only three \u2014 Cheh, Yvette M. Alexander (D-Ward 7), who heads the Health and Human Services Committee, and LaRuby May (D-Ward 8) were present at Friday\u2019s hearing. May, who often invokes God from the dais, said the law appeared to contain the necessary safeguards to prevent abuses and did not appear to defy religious opposition to suicide. The bill \u201cgrants patients the right to transition comfortably without pain and agony,\u201d she said. A spokesman for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said her position on the issue is currently \u201cunder review.\u201d MacIntyre, who is gay, said that his own experience watching a dozen friends die during the 1980s AIDS epidemic informed his view of assisted suicide. Baby boomers who are now contemplating their own mortality \u2014 and that of their parents \u2014 could be the tipping factor that makes such legislation more widespread, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the personal experience; it\u2019s the heightened awareness in the popular culture,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the result of that is increased advocacy and the desire to make change.\u201d", "Title: When a friend asks you to help her die Content: _Jerald Winakur is a clinical professor of medicine and associate faculty member at the Center for Medical Humanities and Ethics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio._ When I read NPR host Diane Rehm\u2019s account of the unnecessarily slow death that her husband, John, had to endure because his doctor refused their request for assistance in ending his life, I was reminded of the time a similar request was made of me. In July 1998, I received a call from an old friend. She was in intensive care in a New Hampshire hospital, where she lay, nearly quadriplegic, with a halo brace screwed into her skull to buttress her broken neck and shocked spinal cord. An avid horsewoman and competitive carriage racer in her mid-70s, she had been devastatingly injured when her horse spooked, flipping the carriage over on top of her. \u201cThe surgeon wants my permission to operate if I improve neurologically but the fracture does not heal. Will you promise me that if I remain a quadriplegic you will come and put me down?\u201d I did not hesitate in my answer to her. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. _Put me down._ This phrase sounded perfectly natural coming from my friend, a farmer-poet and animal rights advocate who raised horses and cared for a coterie of rescue dogs. Her vet bills were always higher than her medical bills. She was well acquainted with death as part of the natural order of things on the farm. I, on the other hand, am a doctor, a geriatrician. And at the time, I had witnessed all too many deaths among my patients and friends. As is common with the elderly in particular, most came after a long struggle with illness and decline. Usually I was able to offer adequate comfort and pain relief, even in those days before palliative medicine and enlightened hospice care became mainstream. But I\u2019d never been asked to help a patient die. Not the young father with widespread lung cancer who took himself out with a shotgun. Or the elderly man who killed his wife \u2014 she who suffered for months with intractable post-shingles facial pain \u2014 and then turned the pistol on himself. But when my friend with the broken neck asked if I would \u201cput her down,\u201d I didn\u2019t hesitate. Why had I said yes? Putting a person down is very different from doing so with a pet. Vets don\u2019t refuse to euthanize an animal whose owner has requested it, but doctors almost never agree to do such a thing. What terrible line had I crossed? Maybe because she was my friend, and not my patient, I felt that somehow the professional commandment to \u201cdo no harm\u201d did not apply? That because I knew her, loved her and respected her, and because she and her family trusted me, I should use my skills to end her suffering if necessary? Perhaps I was just hoping that she would get better. What she wanted from me at that moment was reassurance that I would be there if she needed me. She was desperately afraid, and she turned to me for support. One might ask: Why did she not turn to her own doctor? I suspect it was for the same reason that my patients who contemplated suicide did not turn to me: They knew they would be asking me to do something that could put me and my medical career in jeopardy. Euthanasia of humans is murder, after all. Even if one uses veterinary nomenclature to describe it. A year before my friend broke her neck, Oregon passed, by referendum, the Death With Dignity Act. While the law is controversial, three other states have followed by adopting similar legislation. In Oregon, a competent adult with a terminal disease \u2014 certified by two doctors \u2014 can request a prescription for a fatal dose of drugs to be taken orally. After a waiting period, the medication can be obtained. The patient must be able to self- administer the drug. Doctor participation in the program is voluntary. My friend would not have been a candidate for physician-assisted suicide had it been legal in her state. Quadriplegia is not a terminal illness, despite that she did not want to live that way. Many people, after all, do live with that condition. She would have had to turn to a group like the Hemlock Society, the rifle over the fireplace mantel or \u2014 as hospice often recommends for the terminally ill in their care \u2014 cessation of food and water intake. This takes a week or two and seems cruel, but most patients can be made quite comfortable with state-of-the-art symptom management. This is, indeed, the means by which John Rehm ended his life. But my friend had turned to me. Fortunately for both of us, she made a very nice recovery, never required an operation and spent the next 16 years on her farm writing, gardening and enjoying the natural world, her family and many friends. She had her horses put down when the time came. When I visited her just after her 88th birthday, she was in chronic pain from severe arthritis and debilitated by several end-stage medical conditions. \u201cI\u2019d like to be put down,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my doctors just won\u2019t do it.\u201d Thankfully, she did not make this request of me again. She lived almost one year more. **Read more about this issue:** Catherine Weber: Maryland should adopt a death-with dignity option Charles Lane: House health-care bill oversteps on end-of-life issues E.J.

The pros charge $25 a pop; there is a person in the building who will arrange for a witness if you lack one. But I am a highly qualified amateur. I know both of the so-called chapels; I know that Tuesday is calmer but Friday is way more fun. A few weeks ago, I served as a witness for two couples. Because getting married is the thing to do if you are a gay or lesbian refugee from Russia. There are many of us. No one knows how many exactly, but Immigration Equality, the biggest organization working on behalf of LGBT asylum-seekers in this country, hired a full-time Russian-speaking paralegal last winter \u2014 and still the wait for an intake interview can be weeks or months. When you\u2019re a refu\u00adgee, you are nobody. Back home, you had your neighbors, your co-workers, your friends and even your enemies, all of whom gave you social capital. If you\u2019re like Nik, a journalist who recently emigrated from Sochi, you might have had the police after you, which was a sort of recognition felt nearly every hour of every day. If you\u2019re like me, you were recognized on the street and in cafes. (As a journalist, I\u2019d often been on television; as someone who opposes Putin\u2019s regime, my picture had been featured on pro-Kremlin sites listing Russia\u2019s ostensible enemies.) Or you might be like Natalia and Asia (pronounced: As-ya), whose neighbors threatened to report them to social services for raising an adorable 2-year-old girl in a same-sex household. And now you are in New York, where nobody knows your name. But you are safe. When I talk to LGBT refugees from Russia about what it\u2019s like to live in New York, the first thing they mention is the safety. Which is funny and awful, because they are talking about the most basic kind: physical safety. People are no longer afraid of being beaten or killed, or having their kids taken from them. Other than that, they have no safety net: no job, nor the right to look for one; no friends, other than those they met at the Russian LGBT refugee support group; no papers. This last one becomes the biggest missing piece. \u201cBez bumazhki ty bukashka,\u201d an old Soviet song goes: \u201cWithout a piece of paper you are but a tiny bug.\u201d And a tiny bug is exactly what you feel like if you live in New York City, speak with an accent, look like you\u2019re under 40 and have no papers. No rental apartment, no alcoholic drinks, no Costco card for you. One of the most prized recipes exchanged among new refugees, second perhaps to securing a good immigration lawyer, is how to get a New York state ID. It involves opening bank accounts, engaging in a certain number of financial transactions and traveling to the outer boroughs on a regular basis \u2014 because not all bank branches will open an account for someone with a foreign passport and without a Social Security number. Refugees also coach one another on how to get an apartment through a co-signer, how to get your emergency-room bill adjusted down and where to find free English classes. And then there\u2019s the one place in New York City where you can get a gorgeous bumazhka \u2014 a piece of paper \u2014 recognizing you and a partner as a married couple. You can use your Russian passport with its tourist visa. Hell, the visa can even be expired. You need one witness. Pay $25, and a city official will say to you: \u201cBy the powers vested in me by the State of New York, I now pronounce you married. You can seal your union with a kiss.\u201d Then you kiss. In public, safely. About two weeks ago, I witnessed for Nik and Phillippe, who had asked me to assist. They wore matching blue Oxford shirts, black vests and black bow ties. They bought their silver wedding bands in Chinatown, not far from City Hall. They\u2019d had an appointment with a human rights organization earlier in the day, and they\u2019d been too shy to go in matching outfits, so they changed in the cab on the way over. Nik and Phillippe and I couple-watched as we waited our turn. Our favorite were the Latina lesbians in their late 40s, one wearing a tailored white suit, the other, a white wedding gown. They had a rolling suitcase with them, presumably because they\u2019d also changed clothes somewhere along the way. Three days later, I witnessed for Natalia and Asia. That time, my favorite couple were two French men with a French bulldog. A lot of people came: my wife, Darya; Oleg and his husband, Dmitry; Andrei and his husband, Denis; Ksenia and her wife, Liza. Everybody wears their wedding bands on their left hands, American-style, rather than on the right, as Russians do. Not only can you get married at New York City Hall, you can also attend your friends\u2019 weddings and get the thrill of recognition all over again. We took group photos in the chapel and in front of a giant picture of City Hall, placed inside City Hall specifically for such photo-ops. I don\u2019t think anybody cared that the clerk kept pronouncing Asia\u2019s name wrong, like the continent; she still felt more recognized than she had since she, Natalia and their daughter came over in January. And I do not even believe in marriage. I\u2019m opposed to it as an institution, and I\u2019ve spoken about it publicly often enough that the Kremlin youth movement has declared me the No. 1 enemy of the traditional Russian family. But it turned out that getting settled in the United States with my partner and our three kids would be a lot easier if we got married. When Darya and I wed in late March, we frustrated our chosen minister by trying to refuse to say vows as part of the ceremony. In the end, each of us ended up writing our own vows. In hers, Darya said she was not so much wedding me as she was marrying the United States of America. \u201cWe are still in the honeymoon period,\u201d she said of her new country. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will have our ups and downs. But I will always love her for enabling me to marry the woman I love.\u201d Neither Nik nor Phillippe nor Oleg nor Dmitry nor Andrei nor Denis nor Ksenia nor Liza nor Natalia nor Asia nor I could have put it better. **outlook@washpost.com **", "Title: 5 ways to survive a home decorating project as a couple Content: I admit it. I singlehandedly took over the decorating of my family\u2019s house. To most, this would seem natural because I work in the field and have always had a very strong aesthetic point of view. But what our friends and colleagues don\u2019t realize is that my husband also has interior design opinions \u2014 ones that I bulldozed over. Although I am proud of how our house turned out, I am not proud of the fact that I pretended to, but in reality did not, involve him. My husband equates the decorating process to the time we selected our wedding registry \u2014 I dragged him along under the guise that his opinion mattered when all I really wanted was for him to like what I liked. For our house, we bickered about the placement of the dining table, the color of the sofa, whether to hang curtains and of course the price of everything. In almost all cases, I got my way, but not without consequences. Even today, years after the last room was finished, my decorating domination comes back to haunt me especially in the heat of an argument (it\u2019s the prime example of how I take over everything). Although I can\u2019t undo my actions, I can impart some wisdom to my clients so that their process is more balanced than ours was. I encourage couples to focus on the most important elements of decorating, not just style but also what I call the four C\u2019s: cost, comfort, color and compromise. I also asked for the advice of Gail Saltz, clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital. Saltz gives smart, no-nonsense tips \u2014 ones that I wish I had followed years ago. The No. 1 thing couples fight about is money, so when it comes to decorating, the most important thing you can do is set a budget before you begin. Do your homework and make sure you factor in all extra costs such as moving and installation. I always suggest investing in the big pieces first for each room: sofa, dining table and bed. Saltz suggests going one step further: discuss early on how you will handle either one of you wanting to make a budget change along the way. Comfort is one of the trickiest elements of decorating because what is comfortable for a 5-foot-2 woman might not be comfortable for a 6-foot-4 man. Go furniture shopping together. Also know the purpose of each room and furnish it accordingly. Saltz suggests that couples should decorate in 10-year increments for actual family living. In her experience, many fights occur when couples decorate for an ideal and not for kids, messiness and ease of care, which not only creates tension, but also decreases the opportunity for fun family experiences and memories that build intimacy. From a decorating standpoint, comfort and fabric go hand in hand; you will never be fully relaxed if you are terrified of staining what you\u2019re sitting on. To determine the right fabric choices, think about look, feel and, most important, durability (check out solution-dyed outdoor fabrics for all upholstery). And when it comes to sofas, consider extra-deep seats, down or down-covered foam cushions and ample pillows or throw cushions (these are so that short people like me will be comfortable in those extra-deep seats!). Painting your walls is without a doubt the single most transformative tool in all of interior design and one of the most flexible. Its impact is immediate, changing the mood of a room and your perception of its size. Although painting a room is easy, choosing a color can be a challenge. Numerous times I have sat with couples as they labor over tiny paint chips. Clarity comes when I tell them that the simplest way to judge a color is to try it out, at which point they roll up their sleeves and get to work. Painting is fun, and working together will make you both feel good. Saltz says it is important to give each other credit. \u201cPride in your home, like pride in your family, is something that can increase your closeness because it reflects both your tastes.\u201d When it comes to decorating, I have worked with couples who have clearly delineated responsibilities: He deals with everything outside, she deals with everything inside. But for most it\u2019s not that easy. One client of mine said, \u201call men want a La-Z-Boy recliner, and all women don\u2019t.\u201d Though the truth might not be so black and white, the challenge still is finding a way to balance style desires with comfort and financial desires so that, as Saltz says, \u201cyou avoid later resentments.\u201d I wish I had had that advice. Saltz recommends that couples make communication a priority with weekly check-ins during which they take each other\u2019s temperature on their decisions, budget and any changes that might have arisen. Style is perhaps the trickiest for couples to navigate because it is so personal. You can\u2019t argue with someone if he or she thinks a sofa isn\u2019t comfortable, but you can argue if that person doesn\u2019t like a sofa because of its chunky leg and modern silhouette. Presumably you and your partner have had some discussion of style before you embark on a decorating project, but, quite often, one\u2019s taste changes and evolves during the process. Saltz warns that \u201cif you disagree, remember it is stuff, not people, you\u2019re talking about, so don\u2019t personalize having different tastes.\u201d The one place Saltz makes a definite style recommendation is in the bedroom. She says, \u201cThink \u2018romantic\u2019 in your bedroom. This is your nest with your partner. Increase both of your feelings of being desired by planning a place to share your love for each other.\u201d **More from The Washington Post** Your guide to making a succulent terrarium Tips for finding artwork Take tiny steps toward decluttering your house _Mayhew, a \u201cToday\u201d show style expert and former magazine editor, is the author of \u201cFlip! for Decorating.\u201d_", "Title: Try a 120-square-foot home on for size at the tiny-house hotel in Portland, Ore. Content: The lure of the tiny house is huge. These small homes, less than 200 square feet and often on wheels, appeal to the minimalist, the environmentalist and the frugalist. Certainly, living in a space smaller than some bathrooms is not for everyone, but during the past few years I\u2019ve found myself in countless conversations with like-minded small\u00ad-dwelling enthusiasts. We\u2019ll talk about the idea of paring down and living more simply and affordably. After all, when I\u2019m on the road for extended periods, I\u2019m content with my itty-bitty existence \u2014 that which I can fit in my car. Time and again, I return home and shake my head at all the possessions I\u2019d left behind. In my journey to self-educate about small living, I made multiple visits to a tiny-house community in Northeast Washington (since disbanded) and watched a tiny-house documentary. I\u2019ve fantasized about buying one as a second home, towing it to locales with dreamy views. When my last partner and I had casually discussed cohabitating and talked about tiny houses, I insisted we\u2019d need a flock of them\u2014his, hers, one for my office, one for entertaining and one that housed all our recreational gear. That defeats the purpose, he said earnestly. I sighed, exaggeratedly, sitting in my spacious 900-square-foot rowhouse. Given the robust tiny-house movement (to wit: a handful of TV shows, DIY workshops, tiny-house kits, an annual conference and countless books and blogs), it\u2019s surprising that so few of them exist legally. Although cities don\u2019t spend much time hunting down tiny-house dwellers, the structures violate building code in most jurisdictions, because they don\u2019t meet the square footage requirement for permanent residences. Hence the house-on-wheels regulatory loophole: If folks complain about your house, simply tow it to another spot. Plenty of people offer tiny houses as vacation rentals, but leave it to progressive Portland to introduce the first tiny-house hotel. The Oregon city has not only legalized accessory dwelling units, also called ADUs (small living quarters on the same lot as a larger home), the city embraces and incentivizes smaller-scale living. This approach helped make it possible for Deb Delman and Kol Peterson to open Caravan, which they say is the first legal commercial application of tiny houses in the United States. The houses are hooked up to the electric grid and the city water and sewer systems (sorry, compost-\u00adtoilet devotees). Since Caravan\u2019s opening in 2013, WeeCasa has opened in the small mountain town of Lyons, Colo., with 11 tiny houses, partly inspired by Caravan. The owners promote the resort as a learning center and place to \u201ctry before you buy\u201d; they also have a dealership for purchasing blueprints or finished houses. Next year, a tiny-home inn called Understory will open in Thomas, W.Va., with structures made using natural earth, reclaimed materials and off-grid technologies. \u201cPeople think nothing of spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars building a tiny house, but very few people have been inside a tiny house,\u201d Delman said. She and Peterson, who seem more at ease as small-living activists and educators than hoteliers, regularly open the tiny houses for tours, which can attract upward of 100 people. Delman says three-quarters want to build a tiny house, but a show of hands tells her that typically only one or two have ever spent the night in one. Guests either leave Caravan thinking \u201cNo way,\u201d or their visit fortifies their dream. \u201cSome are really here investigating and measuring,\u201d Delman said, \u201cor, they never thought about living in one but, staying here, they realize they can downsize.\u201d I planned part of my recent cross-country drive around a stay at Caravan, which tends to book up a couple months out. Located in Portland\u2019s Alberta Arts District, the tiny houses are fenced inside a lot accessed by a keypad, so guests enjoy the privacy of a tiny house and the coziness of an enclosed community, yet they\u2019re surrounded by nightlife and they\u2019re steps from a vibrant strip of indie shops and cafes. My beagle and I checked into a house called Rosebud: 120 square feet with a rocking chair on the (tiny) porch and ladder up to a loft sleeping space. On a bookshelf, I found titles such as \u201cThe Big Tiny,\u201d a memoir by tiny-house pioneer Dee Williams, and \u201cCurious Gorge,\u201d about hiking the Columbia River Gorge. A booklet told the stories of each of the six tiny homes, some of which were built specifically for Caravan. Mine was leased from its builder, made largely from recycled materials and lit by Mason jar lights. Inside the closet was wallpaper that looks like a bookshelf, left over from the \u201cPortlandia\u201d skit shot here. On Alberta Street, I stopped at Case Study, a beautiful coffee shop built with wood and steel, for a locally made, small-batch black tea chai. I then convinced myself that citywide tax-free shopping was reason enough to buy souvenirs. A hemp-and-organic-cotton dress and some locally made ruffled pants later, I chuckled at the hypocrisy: succumbing to consumerism during a minimalist living experiment. With the contents of my car, my shopping bags and my bike, I\u2019d covered most of the tiny house floor space. That night, I met some Portland friends for dinner around the corner, at an edgy vegan spot called Bye and Bye. We sat on the patio and shared vegetable and noodle bowls, a vegan meatball sub and soft-pretzel knots. Over drinks, we realized that our group of four consisted of a gay guy with a husband and a straight gal who calls her significant other her \u201cpartner.\u201d We laughed about this new era in which we live. We all returned to Caravan and gathered around the fire pit, and I glanced at the houses around us. One looked like a covered wagon, another was made with corrugated metal and wood shingles. Armed with s\u2019mores ingredients, we set to work at the fire, raindrops tapping on the tent overhead. I met some of the other guests: A Portland couple celebrating a birthday and dreaming about building a tiny house; a single woman traveling from British Columbia; a road-tripping couple who had seen Caravan on Pinterest; and a mother-daughter duo visiting from Ohio after watching \u201cTiny House Nation.\u201d A photographer who had just finished a campfire photo shoot hung around and offered his expertise on marshmallow roasting. As guests retreated to their tiny abodes, those of us remaining had a serious conversation about milk vs. dark chocolate (both were on hand for s\u2019mores, in mini, organic, fair-trade-bar form). The photographer and I closed down the fire pit, and I invited him into my well-lit house so he could point out some routes on a Portland bike map. We sat in the tiny space, knees touching, the map spread out between us. When he left, I stood in the door frame and waved from the tiny porch. I climbed the ladder and onto the bed. Just to see if I could, I sat up straight, and the top of my head grazed the ceiling. I slid under the covers, listening to the rain outside the tiny window, and fell asleep. The next morning I woke early to dreary skies and cycled the photographer\u2019s suggested route to St. Johns Bridge. Back at Caravan, I made tea and oatmeal on the hot plate, showered in the tiny bathroom without banging my elbows on the shower walls and answered a few e-mails on my laptop, standing at the kitchen counter. Before I knew it, the clock struck check-out time, and I regretted booking only one night. I packed my car, situated the beagle and went back to the tiny house for one last look at the place where I\u2019d slept, cooked, bathed, worked and enjoyed company.

Content: _Peter Lovenheim is the author of \u201cIn the Neighborhood: The Search for Community on an American Street, One Sleepover at a Time.\u201d He lives in Rochester, N.Y._ Do you know your neighbors well enough to realize whether something horrible is happening in the house down the street? To call them if you need help? To trust that they\u2019d put themselves at risk to help you? These were some of the first questions that came to my mind this past week as I watched \u2014 riveted, appalled and relieved \u2014 the unfolding story of three women rescued after a decade of captivity in a Cleveland house. Those who helped free Amanda Berry and her 6-year-old daughter, leading to the discovery of the two other women, weren\u2019t police officers or detectives who\u2019d been on the case for years. They were two neighbors: Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero. Ramsey, apparently, had occasionally shared words and barbecue with the alleged kidnapper, Ariel Castro, before he saw Berry screaming for help at the door and answered her calls. Other neighbors are stating that they saw unusual, troubling things at the Castro house over the years \u2014 porch lights left on, a child at an attic window, even a woman crawling naked in the back yard. They say they called police, but police say they have no records of the calls. The fault of this horrible crime, of course, is with whoever kidnapped and held these women. But I wonder what would have happened if the neighbors had spoken to one another more and shared their worries. I wonder if, collectively, they would have pushed law enforcement authorities to check things out, to get involved. I wonder if this tragedy could have been discovered much sooner if the neighbors on Seymour Avenue had been, well, a little more neighborly. Whether in high-rise apartment buildings or homes in the suburbs, Americans are growing more distant from their neighbors. In the 2008 General Social Survey, 30 percent of respondents said they spent a social evening with neighbors more than once a month, compared with 44 percent in 1974. There are exceptions, of course. In my travels around the country to speak about our relationships with those living around us, I\u2019ve found in every community at least some neighborhoods where people know one another, talk regularly and watch out for each other. But these are exceptions \u2014 and have been for some time. As Robert Putnam wrote in his 2000 book, \u201cBowling Alone,\u201d friendly contacts between American neighbors are \u201cmeasurably more feeble now than a generation ago.\u201d Sociologists offer various reasons for such side-by-side isolation. The rise in two-career couples means that fewer people are home during the day. We spend more time watching television and using the Internet. In the suburbs, lot and house sizes have nearly doubled since the 1950s, increasing the distance between neighbors. At one time, putting up a fence in the back yard was considered a somewhat hostile act, but today new homes often come with fences already built. Then there is the pervasive fear of strangers. It used to be that a stranger was just someone we had not yet met; today, a stranger is someone who poses a threat. We\u2019ve gotten to the point where anxiety is the default setting, where it\u2019s acceptable to live side by side, driveway to driveway, with other people for years \u2014 decades, even \u2014 without knowing each other. I hadn\u2019t thought much about how we live as neighbors until a tragedy occurred about a decade ago on my suburban street in Rochester, N.Y. A family had lived about 10 houses down for seven years. One night, the husband came home and shot and killed his wife, then himself. The children, an 11-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl, ran screaming into the night. I didn\u2019t know the family well, and in asking around, I found that no one else did, either. Much like in Cleveland, there had been some warning signs that became much brighter in hindsight: A few weeks earlier, a neighbor saw a police car in the driveway; a close friend suspected that the husband had purchased a rifle; another neighbor thought the husband\u2019s behavior had recently seemed \u201coff.\u201d But everyone kept their bits of information to themselves, and on the night of the shooting, we were all shocked. I wondered: Did I live in a true neighborhood or just on a street surrounded by people whose lives were entirely separate from my own? What would it take to get to know the people on my street beyond a casual wave while walking the dog or a passing conversation about newly planted roses? I recalled sleepovers at friends\u2019 houses when I was a child and how those experiences had given me a sense of what life was like in other people\u2019s homes. It was a bit un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox, but I wondered: Would my neighbors let me sleep over and write about their lives? As it turned out, about half the people I approached said yes. Even the ones who didn\u2019t \u2014 citing a reasonable concern for privacy \u2014 expressed a similar desire to be better connected to their neighbors. I asked to sleep over not to compare my neighbors\u2019 sofa beds but to spend time with them and see what a normal day in their houses was like. With their permission, I watched them help their children with their homework, tagged along on a weekday morning to see where they worked, met them at the supermarket when they did their shopping, dropped by the gym when they worked out, sat with them at church or synagogue. I learned that most of us want more or less the same thing \u2014 to live among others with a sense of common humanity \u2014 and that, at times, there is just no substitute for a neighbor close at hand. If we live as strangers to one another, we lose the chance to realize that the elderly woman who lives alone in the apartment down the hall has let her newspapers pile up for a week \u2014 and maybe someone should check on her. That if three of us on different nights heard angry shouts from the house at the corner, maybe someone should call to see if everything\u2019s okay. That a man down the block, who hardly ever works on his lawn, had his garage door open and bags of nitrogen fertilizer piled high. That the man who lives across the street doesn\u2019t have children, yet there was a young girl at the attic window. This isn\u2019t about being snoops or invading anyone\u2019s privacy. It\u2019s about looking out for one another. Every neighborhood is different, and often our busy lives leave us with little energy to reach out. But doing so keeps us safer. Neighbors, too, can enrich our lives in ways we can\u2019t know until we know them. Neighbors around the country have found inventive ways to meet and connect with one another. Some neighborhoods have gotten people talking to each other by creating directories or maps with residents\u2019 contact information, which can be especially helpful to newcomers. For years, residents in Old Oaks, east of downtown Columbus, Ohio, have been taking turns hosting weekly social hours, called Wednesdays on the Porch, where people come just to chat. In an interview, one resident told me, \u201cMy family and friends are consistently amazed that I know my neighbors, they know me, and we have an involvement in each others\u2019 lives that goes beyond fences.\u201d Annual neighborhood picnics are nice but generally don\u2019t get much traction. But more frequent events \u2014 such as a Fourth of July bike parade for kids, maybe with a town fire truck in the lead; a Labor Day back-to-school barbecue; Christmas caroling; or a progressive dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 can help foster lasting connections. In Shore Acres, a mixed-income Cleveland neighborhood about 11 miles from Ariel Castro\u2019s house, residents created beauty out of the recent housing bust. When an abandoned house burned down, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the neighborhood association and converted it into a community garden. Similarly, owners of six adjoining rowhouses in Albany, N.Y., took down the fences between their tiny back yards and merged their gardens. Stone footpaths now allow the residents to walk among the plants, shrubs and flowers and spend time with one another. Other neighborhoods have converted empty lots into pocket parks or dog runs. And some have found that shifting traditional backyard activities to their front yards \u2014 such as planting flowers or vegetable gardens \u2014 makes neighbors more likely to stop and say hello. A woman who planted a flower garden in her front yard in Philadelphia wrote to me: \u201cNeighbors I knew only by sight now see me outside and stop by to chat. Make yourself available and you will be surprised what doors \u2014 and hearts \u2014 will open.\u201d In this age of cheap long-distance phone calls, discount airlines and the Internet, when we can create community anywhere, people sometimes wonder if neighborhoods still matter. I believe they do. Indeed, Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero remind us of that. They are exceptions to the rule that neighbors mostly keep to themselves. By their intervening, we see that if more neighbors take an interest in each other and watch out for each other, our neighborhoods will be safer and stronger. Ringing the bell and introducing yourself to an elderly person living alone in your apartment building or inviting a few people on your block over for drinks or dinner is a great place to start. **peter@peterlovenheim.com **", "Title: Time to slaughter the rabbits: Two lawyers and their five kids raise \u2014 and kill \u2014 animals on a suburban farm Content: Rabbits, it turns out, are a gateway animal. Because those lead to chickens. Then goats. Then a pregnant sow. And before the two Maryland lawyers knew it, they\u2019d ditched their townhouse, bought two acres in Silver Spring and found themselves chasing piglets around the yard and giving each other sheep for Christmas and a kelly green tractor on Mother\u2019s Day. Kirstin and Mindy Martone-Gulling never really planned to become farmers. Nor is this some ideological, political or radically philosophical Simple Life quest. It just sort of happened, they said. In that one-thing-leads-to-another sort of way. Now their lives are anything but simple, because one of them is a high-powered lawyer with a white-shoe Washington law firm who regularly jets off to London or Dubai and the other moved her solo practice to their home so she could continue practicing law and tending the sheep right after having their fifth child. Exhausted yet? I was, listening to the evolution of an idea that began with wanting those expensive, Whole Foods eggs at home every day and blossomed into Lucky Clover Microfarm. Kirstin, 46, and Mindy, 37, pull off a lifestyle that seems completely crackers. But they somehow manage international business travel, trombone lessons, baseball practice, science fairs, goat milking, 4-H rabbit shows, chorus, snowboarding, Disney World and career advancement. So I wanted to see for myself what suburban microfarm life looks like. \u201cClay, those chickens need feeding,\u201d Kirstin says to their youngest boy, Clayton Martone, 7. They have meat chickens, egg-laying chickens and extravagances like Svart Hona, Swedish black hens that have black feathers, black meat and black bones. Morning chores \u2014 usually goat milking and feeding \u2014 start before 7 a.m. Afternoon chores start around 5, after the four school-aged kids are picked up from after-school music lessons. \u201cThe pigs are out!\u201d Gus Martone, 9, screams, chasing tiny black piglets the size of toasters around the yard. Annika Gulling, 10, has climbed high up into the Kwanzan cherry tree, hidden amid the lush, pink double blossoms. Her twin brother, Finn Gulling, is feeding the rabbits. Finn is insanely curious and loves everything about the farm life. He goes into one of his deep, unsolicited soliloquies, this time about the inner organs of rabbits and how similar they are to the human anatomy and how, after a rabbit is killed, electrical impulses are keeping its heart beating. He doesn\u2019t mind helping with killing and eating the animals he is raising. But that part turned his brother Gus into a vegetarian. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly a guts person,\u201d he confesses, while spending much of that afternoon\u2019s chore time on the backyard zipline. \u201cI cried when I killed the first chicken,\u201d Kirstin said. For many, it\u2019s the most difficult hurdle in living a true farm-to-table life \u2014 killing the animals with your own hands. But it makes all of them value the food on their dinner plates completely differently than if it all had come from the store on foam trays. Thanks to their farm life, the children have already tackled some of those huge life milestones. The birds and the bees? Check. (Rabbits, remember?) Death? Hard work? The food chain? Responsibility for other living things? Check, check, check and check. This whole adventure began when Kirstin read Michael Pollan\u2019s 2006 book \u201cThe Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma\u201d and grappled with the ethics of contemporary, commercial food consumption. The obvious answer for most folks who go into a moral crisis over this is to shop more ethically. Thus, the rise of Whole Paycheck \u2014 oops, I mean, Whole Foods. The Martone-Gullings are a blended family \u2014 both women had two children with previous partners \u2014 and then Kirstin gave birth to their youngest, Arianna, who is 2 and is already a pro at chicken feeding. And even for two lawyers, feeding five kids high-end food would strain the bank, if not break it. So they decided rabbits, then chickens, would be a good way to supplement their grocery shops. When they had those after-bedtime talks about their futures, as all couples do, Kirstin and Mindy first saw full-blown farm life as maybe a retirement thing. But when they saw what the chickens were already doing for the kids \u2014 get up before school, gather the eggs, savor the taste of freshly laid eggs, feed the chickens after school \u2014 they decided to bring the kids along for the whole sheep-goats-ducks-tractor ride. What they do now is called \u201cmicrofarming.\u201d Which is pretty funny, that we\u2019ve given a catchy name to something that humans have been doing for centuries. But microfarming it was. And for two lawyers who grew up in the suburbs and worked in the city, the knowledge about goat castration, fecal floats, rabbit skinning, tractor cages and chicken slaughter wasn\u2019t anything that was passed down through the ages. \u201cI think the irony of this whole thing is that people have been doing this forever, but we learned everything on the Internet,\u201d Mindy said. \u201cHow to kill a chicken? It\u2019s on YouTube,\u201d Mindy said. \u201cI literally had the phone next to me, watching every step on this video on killing a chicken as I did it,\u201d Kirstin said. They head to microfarm Facebook groups, blogs or YouTube every night to learn, study and ask. And to come home after a long day at Latham & Watkins, where Mindy is assistant general counsel for compliance and ethics, and pull out the fecal-float kit and study goat milk cultures is relaxing, invigorating and challenging, she said. They\u2019ve named their operation Lucky Clover Microfarm, and the eggs they don\u2019t use at home or give to neighbors in exchange for their tolerance of morning rooster calls, etc., they sell to other parents at the school car line. They\u2019re going to try to start selling some of their meat, which includes those rabbits and heritage pigs. Their lifestyle is cheaper than buying groceries of this quality at Whole Foods. But it\u2019s probably not less expensive \u2014 Kirstin has a thing for gadgets, Mindy is into exotics \u2014 than feeding their family with cheap, processed food. Economics isn\u2019t the main driving force behind their mad, mad lifestyle. Like most parents, they are exhausted. Like most lawyers, they work too hard. And like most families, their kids have too many scheduled activities. What floors me is that, in an age when we\u2019re all way too busy to take on one more thing, this family took on a huge thing, and, in the process, found a tranquility, authenticity, togetherness and even an earthy romanticism that feels so elusive in our digital age. Each evening, after work and school, they park the van in their long driveway, pull on rubber boots and listen to the chickens, the piglets and the kids under the shade of the cherry trees. They muck around, move some hay, clean some cages and exist in a completely different world that seems centuries old. And it feels very, very good. **Twitter: @petulad**"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the challenges and conflicts that can arise when a couple undertakes a home decorating project together, which is a similar context to living in a tiny home.

From a single businessman who acquired the virus abroad, the disease jumped rapidly from person to person until 36 were dead, 186 infected and thousands were quarantined -- leaving huge swaths of the South Korean capital region, where 25 million people live, paralyzed with fear. Schools closed, department store sales tanked, and tourist visas were canceled. The economic toll was so severe that the country's central bank had to cut interest rates. First identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, MERS has since made its way around the world and infected people in 27 countries. The illness is severe, with patients developing fever, cough and respiratory distress. The death rate is believed to be more than 30 percent. Both men first were seen at Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, a regional facility that had opened months earlier, for what appeared at the time to be pneumonia. They were treated on the same floor, according to health investigators. Both recovered enough to be released. When their conditions worsened, Patient 1 and Patient 14 separately sought help at one of Seoul's premier health centers -- the Samsung Medical Center, a massive university-affiliated hospital with 1,982 beds and a staff of 9,000. Patient 14's story at Samsung began when he arrived in the emergency department and was treated for breathing problems. He was given a mask, the authors note, but \"frequently could not hold it because of severe respiratory symptoms.\" At the time, doctors did not suspect he had been exposed to MERS, so he was not isolated. But two days later, he was contacted by Korean health authorities about his potential contact with Patient 1. The potential damage was estimated to be vast. A total of 1,576 people -- 675 patients, 683 visitors and 218 health-care workers -- were identified as contacts. And testing confirmed doctors' worst fears. The attack rate of the virus, calculated by dividing the number of people infected by the number exposed, was extremely high and caused an \"epidemic curve\" of cases. For the purposes of analysis, the researchers divided the patients into three risk groups. Those in Group A, considered close contacts, had been in the same zone of the emergency room as Patient 14. (Close contact with an infectious patient is traditionally defined as within six feet or within the same room or area for a prolonged period.) Group B consisted of people who were treated in different zones but had overlapped with Patient 14 in the registration area or radiology suite. Group C included patients who were treated in different zones and did not otherwise directly overlap with Patient 14 in space or time in any specific location. The overall attack rate for patients and visitors was only 2 percent in Group C (15 of 1,003) and 5 percent in Group B (six of 116). But for Group A it was incredibly high at 20 percent (47 of 239). The rate of infection for health-care workers was also just 2 percent (five of 218). A timeline of infections is shown below. Those in Group A are in shown as dark grey-blue squares. In total, Patient 14 was linked to 82 MERS cases, or nearly 45 percent of the 186 cases seen in South Korea during the outbreak. By contrast, researchers found that Patient 1 had been in contact with 285 other patients and 193 health-care workers while at the medical center. No transmissions occurred on the day that he was in the general ward before being isolated. (Patient 1 infected 28 others at his previous hospital.) The researchers could not explain the difference but suggested it could have been due to \"a number of factors such as time from onset of disease, symptoms, duration of contact, pattern of movement and the spread of the virus itself.\" They found that individuals who overlapped with Patient 14 in the radiology suite or registration area had higher attack rates (5 percent) than the other patients (1 percent), \"suggesting that transmission might occur by even brief exposures to recently contaminated objects or encounters with individuals carrying a super-spreader.\" The role of super-spreaders was also critically important during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong and the bordering Chinese province of Guangdong. In an accompanying commentary, David S. Hui, a professsor of emerging infectious diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, wrote that the retrospective analysis highlights shortcomings in hospital systems worldwide. He noted the failure of St. Mary's to implement strict isolation of patients and quarantine of contacts as well as both facilities' poor communication and knowledge of patient movement between hospitals. More generally, he highlighted emergency department overcrowding, inadequate ventilation and limited availability of isolation rooms as issues needing to be addressed to prevent future outbreaks. \"Failure in infection control and prevention in health-care facilities has resulted in large numbers of secondary cases of [MERS] infection involving health-care workers, existing patients and visitors in Saudi Arabia and several other countries in the past few years,\" Hui said.", "Title: What you should know about MERS, the mystery disease that has South Korea on edge Content: It began with a single coughing man. A South Korean businessman had just returned from a trip to the Middle East when he started to feel ill. Feverish and wheezing, he made his way to one hospital, then another, then a third, then a fourth. By the time doctors figured out what was ailing him \u2014 a rare disease called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) \u2014 the man had left a trail of the virus across the country. On Friday a 72-year-old patient died from the illness, the 11th death reported in less than a month. But the spread of the disease, which has infected 126 people since the outbreak began last month, seems to have leveled off, and South Korean public health officials are urging calm. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[PHOTOS: South Korea battles MERS]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Still, across the country Koreans remain wary of this new and little-understood illness. MERS first appeared in humans in 2012, and three years later scientists and public health officials are still sorting out where it came from and how it\u2019s spread. Here\u2019s what we do know: **MERS affects the lower respiratory system.** A type of coronavirus (a common form of respiratory virus characterized by a crown-like shape), it\u2019s most comparable to SARS, the disease that caused hundreds of deaths in China and a few other countries between 2002 and 2003 but has since disappeared. Like SARS, MERS seems to be spread between humans through close contact, probably via droplets of spit or other \u201crespiratory secretions\u201d containing the virus that are breathed or coughed out by the infected person. But because the virus is so new, it\u2019s still not clear how this works. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico According to the Centers for Disease Control, MERS usually starts out looking like any old common cold, causing fever, coughs and shortness of breath. But in some patients it can lead to severe complications, ranging from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea to pneumonia and kidney failure. Just over a third of people reported with MERS have died, according to the World Health Organization. As of this March, the WHO reported 1082 cases of the disease and 439 deaths, the vast majority in Saudi Arabia. The outbreak in South Korea is the biggest to happen outside Saudi Arabia since MERS was first identified. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico ** **The virus likely jumped from camels to humans.** **The first (known) case of MERS was reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. At the time, scientists didn\u2019t know where it came from, but gene sequencing and subsequent research have pinned blame on camels. A study of a domestic camels near Dubai just published in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases found that nearly every animal tested had MERS antibodies, indicating that they\u2019d been infected with the disease, and that camels are most infectious before the age of four. The animals then pass the disease onto humans, though it\u2019s not clear how. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **MERS has no cure.** There is no vaccine against MERS, and no available antiviral treatment. The advice on the CDC\u2019s \u201cprevention and treatment\u201d page pretty much amounts to: \u201cDon\u2019t catch it.\u201d With the ominous addendum that, if you should fall dangerously ill, care is available to support your vital functions. But MERS is typically life threatening only in people who have underlying medical conditions \u2014 the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, etc. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **The South Korean outbreak may have been caused by a \u201csuperspreader.\u201d** MERS is notoriously bad at spreading, especially compared with other viral illnesses. Its reproduction number (the average number of people that one sick patient will infect) is thought to be at or below one, though research varies and some studies put it higher. By comparison, the reproduction number for Ebola is about two, for smallpox it\u2019s five, and for measles it\u2019s between 10 and 20. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But in South Korea, something strange happened. One infected man seems to have passed on the disease at least 20 others, according to NPR. The businessman who started it all may be what\u2019s called a \u201csuperspreader,\u201d someone who carries an exceptionally large amount of the virus in his lungs, German virologist Christian Drosten told NPR. It didn\u2019t help that the businessman visited several hospitals before being diagnosed and quarantined \u2014 sick people are more vulnerable to contracting the disease. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[How one joke photo has become a symbol of South Korea\u2019s fears about MERS]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico If the businessman was a superspreader, it\u2019s actually good news for this outbreak, because it means that the people who caught MERS from the businessmen are unlikely to spread it to others. If he wasn\u2019t, then officials must consider a scarier alternative: The virus may have mutated to become more contagious. For now, that seems unlikely to have happened. Alison Clements- Hunt, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, told the New York Times that the virus pattern found in South Korea matched what had been studied elsewhere. It showed no mutations or changes that might affect how easily it spreads. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **In its current form, it is extremely unlikely to cause a pandemic.** So long as MERS has a reproduction number of less than one, it won\u2019t infect enough people to replace itself. Instead, it\u2019s likely to die out, just as SARS seems to have done. And data released Friday by the WHO makes it seem as though this outbreak has passed its peak \u2014 the number of new cases diagnosed each day has fallen continuously since June 4. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **People are frustrated with the South Korean government\u2019s response.** Though this MERS outbreak is unlikely to become a public health disaster, it wasn\u2019t a shining moment for the South Korean health system. Hospitals weren\u2019t alerted to the possibility of MERS as soon as the first case was confirmed, and the government didn\u2019t release the list of 24 facilities where cases had been identified until this Sunday \u2014 at which point dozens of people had already been infected while visiting various hospitals. Meanwhile, Peter Ben Embarek, the MERS point person for the WHO, told Science magazine that the \u201csuperspreading\u201d nature of the outbreak is best explained by lapses in infection control measures at Korean hospitals. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[South Koreans blame government in spiraling MERS outbreak]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico President Park Geun-hye\u2019s weekly approval rating dropped six percentage points in the aftermath of the outbreak, according a recent poll from Gallup-Korea. In the past couple of weeks Park has announced a wave of measures to control the outbreak \u2014 closing schools, tracking the cell phones of people under quarantine, releasing the names of hospitals where infections were identified \u2014 but the steps came too late for some critics. Choi Chang-woo, head of the civic group Citizens\u2019 Solidarity for Safe Society, told the New York Times that the government should have been more transparent. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cNow the government is belatedly trying to mend the fence after the cow had already been stolen,\u201d he said.", "Title: The 5 things you need to know about MERS (and global health) Content: Even before the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has ended, there\u2019s a new infectious disease to fear: Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. MERS appeared three years ago in Saudi Arabia, probably after jumping from camels to their human handlers, and had mostly stayed there \u2014 until last month, when it struck in South Korea. Within that month, MERS has caused more than 100 illnesses and at least 9 deaths in that country. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Will it become an epidemic? Can it be contained? Those questions are on many minds for several reasons. Scientists know relatively little about MERS. We don\u2019t yet know how to treat it. It\u2019s related to other deadly respiratory ailments like SARS. Many wonder whether global institutions like the World Health Organization can keep people safe \u2014 especially after WHO\u2019s failures in responding to Ebola. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But the situation does not appear quite as dire with MERS. Thanks to the lessons learned from previous outbreaks of respiratory diseases and relatively pro-active responses, the global health governance system\u2019s response has reassured a number of experts that a full-blown MERS epidemic is unlikely. At the same time, MERS shows that there are still important shortcomings in global health governance. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **1\\. There\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about MERS yet, but it doesn\u2019t act like a disease that will become a widespread epidemic.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico MERS appears unlikely to become widespread, in part because of its unique qualities. MERS is a relatively new disease. It was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, after a 60-year-old man entered a hospital in Jeddah complaining of shortness of breath, a week-long cough, and kidney failure. Between its discovery in 2012 and this past March, MERS had infected slightly more than 1,000 people and caused nearly 400 deaths. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Two facts about how MERS spreads make a widespread outbreak less likely. First, MERS doesn\u2019t spread very easily. The average MERS patient causes only 0.7 additional illnesses. By contrast, the average SARS patient infected 5 other people. Many of the Saudi cases still occur in people who are in close contact with camels. Since the typical MERS patient does not infect another person, the disease can be contained. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Second, human-to-human MERS transmission is happening mainly within health- care facilities and among people with weakened immune systems. As a result, relatively simple changes in hospital procedures may stop MERS\u2019 spread. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **2\\. The South Korean government is trying to avoid China\u2019s mistakes with SARS.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico When SARS appeared in 2002, the Chinese government\u2019s initial response was abysmal. It denied the reports of a new disease. It recommended ineffective prevention strategies, like using vinegar to disinfect the air. It imposed a news blackout to prevent reporting about \u201catypical pneumonia.\u201d It prevented WHO officials from having access to hospitals and clinics. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico These responses exacerbated the problem, giving the disease time to infect more people and causing people to question the government\u2019s trustworthiness. The secrecy and failure to share information with international partners impeded a timely response, and China was widely condemned. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico At first, the Korean government underestimated the disease\u2019s extent and provided little information about how widely it had spread. This caused many to openly question the government\u2019s ability to handle the crisis. By last Sunday, though, Seoul had thoroughly changed its tactics. The government is sharing the names of all the hospitals treating MERS patients, providing public information about how people can protect themselves, and actively countering rumors. President Park Geun-hye even postponed her planned trip to Washington this week so that she could help coordinate her government\u2019s response. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Korean government\u2019s strategic shift shows that it understands the importance of sharing information to combat a disease outbreak \u2014 and the importance of responding to public unrest. But we have not yet seen whether this newfound openness will restore the public\u2019s faith in the government\u2019s ability to deal with public health, or whether the initial delay in responding will have long-term consequences. **3\\. Diseases like MERS move with people, but that does not mean that people should not move.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Travel spreads infectious diseases. In 1918 and 1919, a global influenza pandemic killed at least 30 million people worldwide, in no small part because World War I troop movements spread influenza around the globe. Nearly a century later, a never-before seen disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in southern China. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Over nine months, SARS spread to 34 countries, caused nearly 8100 illnesses, and killed 774 people. After the outbreak ended, epidemiologists identified globalization and rapid travel as key to SARS\u2019 rapid spread. Indeed, they traced roughly 4000 cases and 550 deaths to a single doctor who checked into a Hong Kong hotel in February 2003. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The current MERS outbreak in South Korea has been traced back to a 68-year-old man who had spent time in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico When these sorts of outbreaks occur, there is often an impulse to close borders, restrict travel, and close down public gathering spots like schools and theaters. Indeed, nearly 2500 South Korean schools have been closed so far. Arrivals at South Korean airports, movie ticket sales, and amusement park admissions are down substantially. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But these reactions, while understandable, are ineffective and may cause bigger problems. WHO is not recommending any travel restrictions, and a WHO-Korean government task force is urging schools to reopen. Why? Since MERS does not spread easily from one person to another, travel restrictions and school closings will do little to stop its spread. Rather, they may generate panic, which can have larger social, economic, and political consequences. They may also discourage people from seeking treatment. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The better strategies are contact tracing and monitoring those who have recently been in affected regions, strategies far more focused on key individuals than immobilizing the whole population. **4\\. MERS in South Korea should not distract us from what is happening in Saudi Arabia.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico While the MERS cases in South Korea have received much attention in recent weeks, the disease remains largely centered in Saudi Arabia. MERS first emerged there, and more than 85 percent of human cases of the disease have happened in the country. Because there is so much we still do not know about MERS and because Saudi Arabia figures so prominently in its origin and transmission, this is where global health institutions need to devote a great deal of time and attention. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Unfortunately, the Saudi government has not shown much inclination to share information or to cooperate with the international community. In 2013, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan lambasted the Saudi government for failing to share virus samples with WHO-affiliated labs, delaying the ability of scientists to research the virus and attempt to discover treatments. International officials have said that the Saudi government has repeatedly denied offers of help and assistance since 2012. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico More recently, the Saudi deputy minister of health deflected attention away from MERS and suggested that the only reason for the high number of cases in his country was that it was looking for them. \u201cThe more you look, the more you find,\u201d he told science journalist Helen Branswell. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico If we have learned anything from the history of successful interventions by global health institutions, it\u2019s that cooperation between national governments and international public health institutions is vital. **5\\. So far, WHO is doing its job.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Under the International Health Regulations, human cases of new diseases that have a high likelihood of spreading internationally should be reported to WHO. In response, WHO works to keep countries informed about risks, builds capacity to detect new cases, and coordinates an international response. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico With Ebola, WHO largely failed to perform these tasks. In the case of MERS, though, it appears to be fulfilling its obligations. WHO set up an emergency committee to work on MERS in 2013, and it publicly makes available both the minutes of its meetings and the names of its members. It has provided governments with guidance about proper procedures and policies for dealing with MERS, and it provides regular updates on the numbers of cases and epidemiological information. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico What explains the difference? Part of it may be that WHO has experience working with this sort of virus. WHO\u2019s response to SARS was widely praised, and MERS and SARS are in the same virological family. It may be that the organization has been monitoring MERS for a number of years, giving it time to develop its expertise and appropriate strategies. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Part of the difference may also be that, unlike Ebola, MERS has not strained the organization\u2019s resources. So far, WHO has not asked the international community for financial contributions for MERS, suggesting that its current resources are enough to handle the outbreak. If things become more serious, WHO may need a serious infusion of money and personnel. Furthermore, if MERS spreads to more countries, it could strain the ability of disease surveillance systems to monitor and trace new cases. The lack of funds to support and strengthen disease surveillance systems is a serious shortcoming in the international community\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of infectious diseases. _Jeremy Youde is an associate professor of political science and department head at the University of Minnesota Duluth.

Here\u2019s what a sensible compromise would look like. Content: There\u2019s bad news from Seattle for advocates of a $15-an-hour minimum wage law. Turns out the measure\u2019s costs to the city\u2019s low-wage workers have outweighed benefits by 3 to 1, according to a new city-commissioned study by University of Washington researchers. The average low-wage worker has lost $125 a month because of the higher-wage decree, the study found \u2014 even before it is fully phased in. David Autor, a leading labor economist at MIT, told The Post the study seemed \u201cvery credible\u201d and suggested that it might have enough \u201cstatistical power\u201d to \u201cchange minds\u201d in the perennial argument over the minimum wage. Autor was wrong \u2014 not about the study\u2019s credibility, but about its potential for moving people off their \u201cpriors.\u201d The Seattle study met a furious counterattack from proponents of a $15 minimum. Defenders of the law came armed with a much rosier assessment of its impact by economists at a pro-labor University of California at Berkeley think tank, produced a few days before the more skeptical one came out. It seems that Seattle\u2019s mayor, a big advocate of the $15 minimum, had gotten a heads-up on the impending negative study and asked the Berkeley group to weigh in. Seattle Weekly called it \u201can object lesson in how quickly data can get weaponized in political debates like Seattle\u2019s minimum wage fight.\u201d We need a more intellectually honest minimum wage debate, one that acknowledges both the intuitive moral appeal of preventing exploitation of the least-skilled, lowest-paid workers \u2014 and the countervailing risk of a wage so high that it harms the very people it\u2019s supposed to help. Years of contention have established two points: Very high minimum wages would be counterproductive economically, and a $0 minimum is impossible politically. Between those realities, economists, activists and politicians haggle endlessly. Meanwhile, better-targeted policies for rewarding work by low-income people \u2014 such as the earned-income tax credit wage supplement \u2014 get short shrift. And so perhaps we should change the subject, from how high we set the wage to how __ we set it, period. The goal: a relatively objective process, as opposed to just picking a number that sounds good to Bernie Sanders or, for that matter, the restaurant lobby. Undemocratic, you say? The author of the federal minimum wage, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, believed that this was an issue best left to technocrats. His first proposal for a minimum wage called on the Labor Department to fine-tune it, industry by industry. Congress rejected that idea, sparing the country a bureaucratic nightmare while creating a political one: a federal minimum wage that can be changed only if lawmakers act. FDR\u2019s methods were clumsy, but his instinct was sound: If government is going to make a rule for the labor market, the least it can do is base it on facts about the labor market. Congress should benchmark the minimum-wage level to historical data, then connect it to an independent adjustment factor, so that when it rises, it does so consistently and in response to shifts in the economy \u2014 not the political winds. Consider: Since 1938, the federal minimum wage has not exceeded 54 percent of average private-sector hourly wages, a level it hit in 1968, nor fallen below 28 percent, which is where the $7.25 federal minimum ranks today. The midpoint between those extremes is 41 percent, a number that felicitously resembles ratios between minimum and average wages in other advanced industrial countries. Multiplying 41 percent by the current average hourly wage, $26.22, yields a new federal minimum of $10.75. Phase it in over a few years, index it to wage growth or an equivalent factor \u2014 and move on to less contentious topics like health care, or how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. It would require Republicans to make a huge ideological concession. But the payoff for them would be significant: the immediate, and permanent, defusing of an issue that naturally favors Democrats. Businesses might complain. But a 41-percent-of-average-wage minimum wage would not be that big a hit to them, given that more than half of all workers already live in states or cities, such as Seattle, that have raised the minimum wage above the federal level, in response to political campaigns that sprouted in the absence of congressional action. Indeed, to account for local labor markets, Congress might grant states waivers to set their own minimum wages higher or lower than the federal one, provided that they do so by applying the federal methodology to state wage levels. Heaven knows our states and cities could do with one less thing to argue about, too. _Read more fromCharles Lane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ **Read more here:** The Post\u2019s View: $15 is the wrong goal for minimum-wage advocates Ben Spielberg: Seattle\u2019s higher minimum wage is actually working just fine Charles Lane: The risks of California\u2019s minimum-wage increase Katrina vanden Heuvel: How a $15 minimum wage went from \u2018extreme\u2019 to enacted", "Title: Cities are passing higher minimum wages \u2013 and leaving the suburbs further behind Content: Last week, Seattle's city council voted to raise the local minimum wage to an unprecedented $15 an hour, more than twice the federal wage threshold and well above the next most generous cities in America.

By Berube's calculation with colleague Sid Kulkarni, there are actually more low-wage jobs currently paying less than $15 in the King County suburbs outside of Seattle than inside of the city itself. And many of the workers who will benefit from the new wage in Seattle -- 40 percent of them according to a University of Washington analysis -- actually live outside of the city. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The landscape of minimum wage increases points to a significant but seldom- discussed trend that has been taking place across the country: The poor who would benefit most from higher wages increasingly live in the suburbs. And a lot of the kinds of jobs they do have been moving out there, too. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Those shifts underscore why cities and suburbs, where they can -- as Washington D.C., Montgomery County and Prince Georges County have -- should aim to coordinate minimum wage hikes. Or, at least, they should try to in the absence of consensus among state or federal policymakers. As for the alternative, Seattle in particular now raises questions at a scale we've never seen before about what happens when you boost wages in just one piece of a labor market. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday \"I\u2019m sure there will be much to study,\" says Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Says Berube: \"If a city is raising its minimum wage by a dollar or two dollars relative to its surrounding jurisdictions, the tradeoffs aren\u2019t that large. But at six dollars, I think people will begin to sit up and take notice.\" What we might expect to happen, he says, are border wars between neighboring jurisdictions, although the competition theoretically crosses borders in both directions. Suburban communities could lure businesses (and the employment that comes with it) with the promise of lower labor costs. But so, too, could a city like Seattle win the competition for workers with higher wages. Michael Reich, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, has studied with Arindrajit Dube and T. William Lester the impact of higher minimum wages on county pairs across the country that straddle state borders separating different wage standards. Consistently, their work has found no negative employment effects in those areas that have raised the minimum wage. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday \"What\u2019s going on?\" Reich asks. \"A lot of the attention goes to the demand side of the labor market and the argument that if you raise the price of labor, you\u2019re going to want to demand less of it if you\u2019re an employer. It\u2019s almost like a law, a downward sloped demand curve. But, we teach in Econ 101 that markets are determined by labor demand and supply sides.\" Most of the jobs we're talking about here are in sectors like retail, hospitality and restaurants. Those businesses spend a lot of money on employee turnover. But with better wages, Reich says, employees are likely to stay longer, meaning they become more experienced and productive, and the costs of replacing them and retraining workers declines. Those benefits offset some of the higher costs of labor. The rest of the costs, Reich says, may be passed onto consumers in barely perceptible ways -- a few cents on the dollar in restaurants. One question, though, is whether these more productive, higher-paid workers will come into a city like Seattle from the suburbs at the expense of teenagers and the poor already living there. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday None of this existing data has considered a wage hike as high as Seattle's, or a differential as large as the one that will open up between Seattle and surrounding communities with the state minimum wage of $9.32. It's likely that those suburbs will benefit in other ways. Suburban residents who earn $15 an hour working in Seattle will bring that money back home to the suburbs. And to the extent that this wage alleviates poverty there, suburbs that have been ill prepared by history to provide services for the poor will need to invest less public money on such subsidies. Whatever happens in Seattle in the coming years, though, may not necessarily tell us much about how similar scenarios could play out elsewhere. Seattle has a strong labor market and tourism economy. It's unlikely that hotels and restaurants who cater to high-income residents and visitors would be willing to relocate to the suburbs just to save on low-wage labor. That's not a gamble every city can make. In a city like Hartford, Conn., Berube says, the median income is actually lower than in surrounding suburbs, making it much harder for the city to go it alone on a minimum wage hike. The same could be true in a city like Atlanta, which contains a smaller share of the metropolitan region's population and economy than Seattle does relative to its region. Washington, D.C., is more akin to Seattle. It's a comparably sized city with a strong economy, nested within a larger region of about four-and-a-half million people. Washington and two of its neighboring counties in Maryland, though, have gone a different route, coordinating minimum wage increases in the last year (without Virginia, that is). \"That was a superb, thoughtful, innovative move, to have everybody move together,\" Mishel says. The politics of accomplishing that won't work everywhere, though. And cities like Chicago, New York and Los Angeles currently considering a higher wage aren't making plans right now in conjunction with their neighbors. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday \"I think if they take their time and they do the research, and they look at where their workers live and where low-wage work is in the region,\" Berube says, \"they\u2019ll come to the realization that this should be about the metropolitan labor market rather than what\u2019s going on in the city alone.\" Of course, the much simpler solution would be a federal minimum wage increase, or state hikes. But so much of the momentum on this issue right now is in cities. In Seattle, that $15 standard was set by two newly elected local politicians, a new progressive mayor and a socialist city council member. It's possible that they'll prove a $15 minimum wage isn't as harmful as critics warn, and then the suburbs will find it easier to follow them. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday \"Right now it\u2019s just about first movers, seeing who else comes along, where the conversation moves,\" Berube says. \"It\u2019s probably going to occur in these elite and successful cities. And then it\u2019s a question of does it try to trickle down to the next layer of cities who might be less well positioned to undertake this? Or does it move out to their wealthy suburbs, the Montgomery Counties of the world who also can probably afford to do this?\"", "Title: Seattle\u2019s bold minimum wage experiment Content: Vying for the title of the United States\u2019 most progressive city, Seattle this week decided to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour. Depending on which pundit is nattering away, this means Seattle is either going to fall off the map and become a \u201cMad Max\u201d-style economic wasteland or transform into an egalitarian utopia that inspires sweeping pro-labor activism nationwide. Both sides claim to know, with impressive certainty, how Seattle\u2019s bold experiment will turn out. But that\u2019s exactly what it is: a relatively unprecedented experiment whose effects on workers, businesses and the local economy are unknowable. Anyone who claims otherwise is either lying or misguided. Despite literally hundreds of studies focusing on the minimum wage, top economists are still uncertain about the consequences of raising it. In a survey of several dozen elite academics last year, exactly zero said they had a strong sense of what happens to the lowest-skilled workers when you require companies to pay them more. In the absence of a reliable forecast, here\u2019s a framework for thinking through both what\u2019s likely to happen as Seattle adopts the highest minimum wage in the nation and whether other cities should follow suit. Those opposed to raising the minimum wage typically argue that if you increase the cost of something, people will buy less of it, whether we\u2019re talking about socks or labor. That\u2019s true to a point, but the magnitude of the effect really depends on how sensitive buyers are to changes in price. For small changes to current costs, demand for labor looks pretty inelastic. In other words, studies have found, you\u2019re not likely to see mass layoffs if the minimum wage goes up a touch. Instead, a modest minimum-wage increase is likely to be a transfer from employers to employees that will not discernibly depress low-wage employment. That\u2019s a good thing, if you want to improve the lives of the working poor. It\u2019s why the proposal to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 seems like a pretty safe idea. At some point, though, if you raise the wage floor too much, you probably do more harm than good. Even Thomas Piketty, a strong proponent of raising the minimum wage (whose work is cited somewhat inaccurately in Seattle\u2019s new ordinance) agrees. \u201cObviously, raising the minimum wage cannot continue indefinitely: as the minimum wage increases, the negative effects on the level of employment eventually win out,\u201d he writes in \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know, based on the evidence we have, exactly when you reach that tipping point. My own guess is that by the time you get to $15 per hour, some more marginal low-skilled positions \u2014 grocery baggers, shopping-cart retrievers, busboys \u2014 will start disappearing. To the extent that minimum-wage jobs are \u201ctradable\u201d \u2014 i.e., moveable across borders \u2014 some jobs will just be shifted to where labor is cheaper. But most very-low-wage jobs are probably not tradable; they tend to be concentrated in sectors such as retail, restaurants, hotels, cleaning crews and health care, all services that are hard to perform from afar. One other possible consequence of a $15 minimum wage is that companies will invest in more automation. Think self-checkout machines instead of cashiers. Again, not all low-skilled work can be automated, at least not as quickly as firms will want to reduce headcounts. So some of the burden of a higher minimum wage might fall on consumers, through some combination of higher prices and worse service (longer waits at the coffee shop, say). The good news for Seattle: It\u2019s a pretty rich area with low unemployment. It seems better equipped to absorb the shock from a $15 minimum wage than a lot of other places. Which is maybe why the city feels emboldened to try its \u201cliving wage\u201d experiment, and why lots of other cities may not be able to follow in its path. All that said, even if Seattle\u2019s plan does improve the pay of the working poor without reducing employment, raising the minimum wage is still not necessarily the best strategy for cities, states and the nation to combat poverty and inequality in the long run. Mandating higher pay, after all, is a band-aid for much deeper structural problems in the U.S. economy. It addresses the outcomes rather than causes of inequality, which begins in utero and widens throughout childhood and early adulthood. Raising the minimum wage may be the easiest policy to sell to voters, but expanding access to high-quality education (preschool all the way through higher ed), good nutrition and safe, affordable housing are probably more potent ways to improve the lot of the United States\u2019 most disadvantaged families. **Read more about this topic:** Howard Meyerson: Raise wages, create jobs Robert J. Samuelson: Minimum-wage mirage? Katrina vanden Heuvel: Let\u2019s stop subsidizing economic inequality Catherine Rampell: Big Potato\u2019s demand: More taters for tots", "Title: Push for minimum wage hike led by localities, Democrats Content: States and municipalities across the country are leading a localized push to raise the minimum wage, driven largely by Democrats, who see an opening to appeal to working-class Americans at a time of growing inequity. Efforts in Congress to raise the national minimum wage above $7.25 an hour have stalled. But numerous local governments \u2014 including those of Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, and the District \u2014 are forging ahead, in some cases voting to dramatically increase the pay of low-wage workers. The efforts, while supported by many unions, threaten to create a patchwork of wage rates that could mean workers in some areas will be entitled to vastly less than those working similar jobs nearby. The campaigns reach from coast to coast. \u201cCongress can\u2019t do anything right now, and even if they could, they wouldn\u2019t even come close to the level that various cities and states around the country are looking at,\u201d said Phil Mendelson, the Democratic chairman of the D.C. Council, which is expected to take an initial vote Tuesday setting the city\u2019s minimum wage at $11.50 an hour by 2016. The county councils in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s voted this week to reach $11.50 \u2014 higher than any rate in effect in the United States \u2014 by 2017. The coordinated effort emerged in recent months after local officials decided they could not wait for Congress or state legislators. As minimum wage fights have gone increasingly local, Democrats have led the charge, working to define themselves as the party of blue-collar workers while casting Republicans as defenders of corporations and big business. Backing minimum wage increases, even in otherwise conservative states, sharpens that definition, they believe. Minimum wage increases have broad public support, and income inequality issues have touched a nerve in many places. \u201cWhen the pope starts criticizing trickle-down economics, you know the gulf between rich and poor has become too much to ignore,\u201d said Tom Lindenfeld, a Democratic consultant with close ties to labor unions. President Obama has called for an increase in the national rate, mentioning it in his most recent State of the Union address and recently signing on to a proposal from congressional Democrats to set a $10.10 hourly rate. But congressional Republicans have opposed any increase, saying it would hurt employers and curtail job growth. \u201cWhen you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said in February. Many states long ago set their rates slightly above the federal minimum, and a handful of cities \u2014 notably San Francisco and Santa Fe, N.M. \u2014 joined them. The District has set its minimum wage at $1 above the federal standard since 1993. But the recent push is distinguished by the number of jurisdictions involved and the magnitude of the increases proposed. This year, a group of unions, led by the Service Employees International Union, spurred efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for airline and restaurant employees at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, just south of Seattle. Voters in 2012 decided to increase the minimum wage in Albuquerque to $8.50, and have yearly cost-of-living bumps, beginning this year. The California legislature, which is dominated by Democrats, passed a law over Republican objections this year to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2016. Massachusetts lawmakers also are considering a $10 wage. New Jersey voters endorsed an $8.25 wage this month, even while voting overwhelmingly to reelect Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who opposed it. Even in red states, Democrats see opportunity in minimum wage increases. Democrats are deep in the minority in legislatures in South Dakota and Arkansas, for instance. But both states allow for statewide referendums, and Democrats there are gathering signatures to put minimum wage increases on the ballot in 2014. Just as Republicans used initiatives banning same-sex marriage as a way to boost turnout in 2004, Democratic candidates may find that sharing a ballot with a minimum wage measure helps draw the contrast between the two parties. Democratic-held Senate seats in South Dakota and Arkansas are vulnerable in 2014, while Democratic incumbents in Arizona, including Reps. Ron Barber, Ann Kirkpatrick and Kyrsten Sinema, will face tough reelection fights. \u201cHaving minimum wage measures on the ballot in certain states next year may prove electorally beneficial to Democrats,\u201d said Carolyn Fiddler, a Democratic strategist at the Atlas Project. \u201cIt certainly seems to poll well generally.\u201d Nonetheless, proposals to raise the minimum wage are hotly contested. Supporters and opponents of the $15 proposal in SeaTac, Wash., spent more than $2 million on advertising, mailings and polling \u2014 in a city with just 12,106 registered voters. The measure passed by 77 votes out of just more than 6,000 cast, meaning supporters and opponents spent about $327 per vote. In the D.C. area, the dynamics have had less to do with party politicking and more to do with the region\u2019s rising cost of living and local frustrations over the unwillingness of congressional or state lawmakers to take action. In late August, Montgomery County Council member Marc Elrich found himself on the Mall listening to the anniversary speeches of the 1963 March on Washington. Speakers repeated how a $2 minimum wage won then by civil rights leaders had since eroded to a fraction of its buying power. \u201cThat stuff makes you think,\u201d Elrich (D-At Large) said. \u201cThe idea that we were in a better place 50 years ago \u2014 that\u2019s pretty pathetic.\u201d In this year\u2019s legislative session, Maryland lawmakers took no action on bills that would have raised the state\u2019s minimum wage to $10 an hour by mid-2015, in part because of staunch resistance from retailers and other employers. At the council\u2019s first meeting after Labor Day, Elrich proposed a new county minimum of $12 an hour. The next week, a months-long battle in the District over whether to force Wal-Mart and a few other large retailers to pay their workers a super-minimum wage of $12.50 came to a head. Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) had vetoed a Mendelson-authored measure to require the higher wage. Mendelson couldn\u2019t find the votes for an override, and supporters left city hall vowing to fight for a higher minimum wage for all workers instead. Soon after the defeat, Elrich approached Mendelson at the North Capitol Street offices of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. Mendelson said he would be interested in aiming for a regional increase in the minimum wage. It was a conversation Elrich had already had with Prince George\u2019s County Council Chairman Andrea Harrison (D-Springdale) at a government conference in August. \u201cMr. Elrich said, \u2018Hey, I am working on a piece. Do you think you might be interested?\u2019 \u201d Harrison recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018I am working on a piece, too,\u2019 . . . and the rest is history.\u201d Virginia jurisdictions were not included in the effort, the organizers said, because counties and cities in the commonwealth don\u2019t have the power to set minimum wages. If they did, the effort probably would have crossed the Potomac River. \u201cPersonally, if I had the power to do it, I\u2019d propose it in a New York minute,\u201d said J. Walter Tejada (D), chairman of the Arlington County Board. In late September, Elrich, Mendelson and Harrison held a conference call from their offices. Elrich started the negotiation at $12. Mendelson called in thinking he would be comfortable with $11.25. The numbers were arbitrary but not unjustifiable: Had the minimum wage from 1968 kept pace with inflation, it would be about $10.77. And a \u201cliving wage\u201d in the region \u2014 sufficient to cover basic costs of living \u2014 is more than $13, according to several academic studies. They settled on $11.50 \u2014 a rate that, if in effect today, would be the nation\u2019s highest. \u201cAt the end, it was \u2018go forth. . . and get the votes,\u2019 \u201d Elrich said. At its highest purchasing power, in the 1960s and 1970s, the nation\u2019s minimum wage approached a rate of 50 percent of the country\u2019s median wage. That\u2019s a ratio economists say is still important in assessing its ability to keep low-income residents out of poverty. Under the proposals passed by Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s and nearing approval in the District, the ratio would be about 40 percent by the time the $11.50 hourly rate is reached in 2017. But barring action from Congress and the state legislatures, those jurisdictions will be surrounded by areas guaranteeing substantially lower wages \u2014 as much as 30 percent less, if the current federal minimum holds. The effects of having such vastly different rates in the same metropolitan area are largely unknown. Stephen Fuller, an economist who directs the Center for Regional Analysis at the George Mason University School of Public Policy, said the raise will have an effect in terms of lost jobs, lost income, higher prices and lost sales to adjacent areas. While a higher minimum wage will be good for the workers, he said, \u201cit cannot be thought of as being cost free.\u201d But Pete Davis, an analyst with the Center for Study of Responsive Law, a think tank headed by liberal activist Ralph Nader, said a lack of uniformity is a poor reason not to take action. \u201cThe D.C. area has one of the highest costs of living in the nation, so it makes sense that they are going to lead the charge on fighting back on inequality,\u201d he said. Elrich said he is also fine with pricey urban areas having different minimum wages than more rural ones, where the cost of living is lower. \u201cWhat\u2019s right for Montgomery or the D.C. region as a whole may not be what\u2019s right for another jurisdiction,\u201d he said. The political ramifications of the Washington jurisdictions\u2019 effort are likely to be clearer than the economic ones. A local D.C. economy already under intense scrutiny for its ties to the federal government will be even more so as partisan observers try to determine whether every job lost or gained relates to some of the nation\u2019s highest minimum-wage requirements. And Davis said he sees the effort as the start of something bigger, especially for urban areas: \u201cWhen a region like D.C., Prince George\u2019s and Montgomery can do it, and they are successful, people are going to start to realize you can do it in New York and Chicago and Dallas and across the country.\u201d", "Title: So far, the Seattle minimum-wage increase is doing what it\u2019s supposed to do Content: What happens when a study shows that a minimum-wage increase is simply having its intended effect? When it\u2019s found to raise the pay of low-wage workers without causing much in the way of the job displacements that critics rail about? Unfortunately, one thing that apparently happens is the findings get misinterpreted (though, as I\u2019ll show, this is partly due to the omission of key statistical information). The study also found that, relative to historical trends, the rate at which low-wage workers affected by the increase stayed employed rose by about three percentage points. For workers in the control group, it was up four points. Thus, absent the minimum-wage increase, there\u2019d arguably be one percentage point more affected workers employed in Seattle. Putting aside for a moment the critical question of whether these changes are actually meaningful in a statistical sense, these outcomes fit comfortably into a view well understood by minimum-wage advocates and increasingly accepted by economists: most increases have their intended effect of lifting the pay of low-wage workers with little in the way of job losses. To be clear, the fact that the policy has its intended effect doesn\u2019t mean every affected worker ends up ahead (there is no policy on Earth that is always and everywhere costless to its intended beneficiaries). It means that the vast majority of low-wage workers end up with higher earnings. Even if some workers lose some hours of work, their annual income often goes up (which, in fact, is another finding from the study). Minimum-wage opponents who claim that increases will cripple local economies, either overall or even in their low-wage sectors, thus get no help from the Seattle results. The study\u2019s authors point out that one challenge in teasing out minimum-wage effects was that the Seattle economy \u201cboomed\u201d over this period, posting growth rates that \u201ctripled the national average\u201d and \u201coutpaced Seattle\u2019s own robust performance in recent years.\u201d The study also has several important limitations, noted by minimum-wage scholar Michael Reich. First, as Reich explains, \u201cThe authors did not report the standard errors of the estimates, even though their calculations indicated that the employment effect was not distinguishable from zero.\u201d This is a serious omission; policymakers cannot make informed decisions without that information. Second, because of data limitations, the study analyzes employment changes solely in single-establishment firms. That means, for example, that retail and restaurant chains \u2014 groups significantly affected by the minimum wage \u2014 are generally left out of the study (multi-establishment employers account for half of Seattle\u2019s jobs). In fact, when all establishments are included in the analysis, employment outcomes were relatively more positive in Seattle than in the control group, both for all firms and for lower-wage firms. These and other problems, especially the omission of standard errors, need to be resolved. But for now, here\u2019s what we can conclude: After Seattle raised its minimum wage, low-wage workers\u2019 employment, hours and wages all rose substantially. Neighboring areas that had similar trends in these variables before the increase \u2014 and that, by the way, were also bound by the highest state minimum wage in the country when the increase took effect \u2014 saw even larger employment and hours gains. In other words, relatively high minimum wages in Seattle and in Washington more broadly have had their intended impact and have been perfectly compatible with a strong economy, one that\u2019s handily beating national averages. As the Seattle minimum wage phase-in progresses, and the differential between the wage there and elsewhere grows larger, perhaps we\u2019ll get results that really do fall outside the bounds of the standard outcomes.

The disease, absent from the country for at least a century, struck soon after the arrival in 2010 of several hundred peacekeeping troops from Nepal, which at the time was struggling with a cholera outbreak. Untreated waste from the peacekeepers\u2019 base was discharged into an adjacent river and, in short order, Haitians in nearby villages began to get sick and die. In a nation with paltry infrastructure and an anemic public health system, the disease spread quickly. Epidemiologists soon traced the outbreak, and even the specific strain of cholera, to the U.N. base, concluding there was no other plausible source of the disease. Despite that, U.N. officials adopted a three-monkeys policy: They saw nothing. They heard nothing. They said nothing. That tone-deaf stance appeared driven by U.N. lawyers, loath to crack the shell of legal immunity they insisted was the U.N.\u2019s birthright. Doubtless, they feared any admission that might expose the organization to billions of dollars of claims in lawsuits arising from deaths and infections, not to mention from people affected in the future. That lawyerly posture was heedless of the U.N. charter, whose preamble affirms its commitment to human rights, \u201cbetter standards of life\u201d and other goals at odds with a flat refusal to own up to the facts in Haiti. The reality, which the U.N. at last seems ready to accept, is that the organization must recognize its responsibility and renew its commitment to combat cholera in Haiti and strengthen the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure, which the organization has previously pledged to improve, to little effect. That may be difficult and costly; the alternative was untenable. **Read more about this topic:** The Post\u2019s View: Cholera\u2019s fresh attack in Haiti The Post\u2019s View: United Nations must admit its role in Haiti\u2019s cholera outbreak The Post\u2019s View: The United Nations\u2019 duty in Haiti\u2019s cholera outbreak", "Title: The United Nations comes clean(ish) on cholera in Haiti Content: MORE THAN six years after a brigade of U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal introduced cholera in Haiti, triggering an epidemic that has killed at least 10,000 and sickened many more, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has finally uttered the word \u201csorry.\u201d Mr. Ban\u2019s tortuously worded apology, delivered recently in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, must be the beginning, not the end, of official contrition and accountability by the United Nations in Haiti. The glacial rate at which the United Nations grasped its moral responsibility for having wreaked a public-health disaster in the Western Hemisphere\u2019s most impoverished nation has tarnished the institution. Cowed by its lawyers, jealously guarding its prestige, the United Nations averted its gaze from the victims, ignored incontrovertible scientific evidence and trembled at its potential legal liability. Only when it became clear that its credibility was in tatters, and its authority to insist that member states adhere to international norms was in jeopardy, did the United Nations finally come to terms publicly with its culpability in the cholera outbreak. \u201cWe simply didn\u2019t do enough with regard to the cholera outbreak and its spread in Haiti,\u201d Mr. Ban said. \u201cWe are profoundly sorry about our role.\u201d His statement, coming just a month before his term as the United Nations\u2019 eighth secretary general expires, painstakingly avoided an overt admission of what is already known: that the outbreak began when Nepalese peacekeepers, failing to use basic protocols of sanitation at their base when they arrived in 2010, contaminated a nearby river that provided drinking water for Haitians. Cholera was rampant in Nepal at the time; it had been unknown in Haiti for decades. What is critical now, as U.N. officials have acknowledged, is that the organization take concrete steps to make amends, namely by leading a public health blitzkrieg to eradicate the disease in Haiti and by making reparations, to victims\u2019 families, their communities or both. Legal accountability is not the point; a federal appeals panel ruled this summer that the United Nations enjoys diplomatic immunity from the victims\u2019 claims. But moral accountability demands a sustained effort to wipe out a disease that has caused so much suffering in that country. It won\u2019t be easy. U.N. officials say they have nearly raised the $200 million they sought to overhaul water and sanitation infrastructure in Haiti, and to treat cholera\u2019s steady flow of fresh patients there. That\u2019s a first step toward what is likely to be a long struggle for eradication. Unfortunately, they have made little progress in raising from member states what they hope will be an identical amount of money to provide payouts, scholarships and other benefits to the relatives and communities of the dead. Under Mr. Ban\u2019s successor, former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Guterres, who takes office Jan. 1, the United Nations has every incentive to press ahead both to heal Haiti to the extent possible and to restore its own moral standing. **Read more on this topic:** Joel Dreyfuss: Only Haitians can save Haiti The Post\u2019s View: The Herculean task facing Haiti The Post\u2019s View: The U.N. finally owns up to its role in Haiti\u2019s cholera outbreak Charanya Krishnaswami and Muneer I.

But the acknowledgment this week by U.N. officials that its troops bear responsibility for Haiti\u2019s cholera epidemic comes at a time when the organization is already facing criticism for undermining countries it has been sent to stabilize. The United Nations\u2019 admission that its forces played a role in triggering Haiti\u2019s 2010 cholera outbreak is seen as a long-overdue official recognition of _something_ that has been widely known \u2014 but stubbornly denied by U.N. leaders \u2014 for years. It follows accusations this year that U.N. peacekeepers have committed rape and murder in the Central African Republic, and more recently that they failed to defend aid workers against brutal attacks in South Sudan. Critics say these scandals have laid bare the United Nations\u2019 struggles to police its forces and investigate claims of wrongdoing and abuse, whether in cases of negligence \u2014 such as Haiti \u2014 or the allegations of more serious crimes in Africa. When the United Nations fails to accept its responsibility as well, said Akshaya Kumar, the deputy U.N. director at New York-based Human Rights Watch, the peacekeeping system breaks down. \u201cI think one of biggest losses from cases like this is loss of trust between U.N. and communities they\u2019re sent to serve; that is really hard to rebuild,\u201d she said. __ That has been the case in Haiti, where thousands of heavily-armed troops with U.N. blue helmets have been deployed since the bloody 2004 ouster of then- President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti is resented by many Haitians who view the foreign troops as an occupying force. But their role in policing the volatile country is considered _critical_ by international donors and foreign governments. U.N. officials have refused for years to accept blame for bringing cholera to Haiti, but suspicions have long settled on a contingent of U.N. troops from Nepal who arrived after the January 2010 earthquake that devastated the capital of Port-au-Prince. A cholera epidemic in Nepal was underway at the time, and raw waste from the latrines at the U.N. troops\u2019 camp in Haiti was allowed to seep into an adjacent river. In a statement sent to The Washington Post, Farhan Haq, a deputy spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said that the organization has become convinced in the past year that it needs to do much more regarding its own involvement in the initial cholera outbreak in Haiti and the suffering of those affected by the disease, which has sickened hundreds of thousands and left about 10,000 dead. The U.N. acknowledgment, first reported by the New York Times, comes after top officials were provided a draft report by an adviser criticizing their handling of the cholera outbreak. Haiti\u2019s 2010 earthquake left as many as 200,000 dead, and the damage has been compounded since then by periodic flare-ups of cholera. A recent report by Doctors Without Borders has raised the possibility the disease may have killed far more Haitians than previously estimated. Cholera spread virulently in the muddy, crowded tent camps where destitute Haitians took refuge after the quake. Nearly six years later, the disease continues to claim new victims, particularly in rural parts of the country without access to clean drinking water. A new spike in infections has been reported this year. Ban has pledged more than $2 billion to fight the disease in Haiti, but has struggled so far to raise the funds from member states. Haq said the Haiti report, written by Philip Alston, a New York University law professor and U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, would probably be published late next month and presented by Ban at the U.N. General Assembly in October. Alston did not respond to requests for comment. The United Nations \u201cwanted to take this opportunity to welcome this vital report,\u201d Haq said. Without giving details, Haq said the draft report criticizing the U.N. handling of the outbreak, and its recommendations, \u201cwill be a valuable contribution to the U.N. as we work toward a significantly new set of U.N. actions.\" He said the United Nations has been working to fight cholera since the outbreak but would present a new set of measures after discussions with Haitian authorities and U.N. member states. A U.N. spokesman who was asked about the report Thursday said the organization\u2019s legal position \u201chad not changed\u201d and that it was working to \u201cfigure out how to resolve\u201d questions of its responsibility in the outbreak. The U.N. charter affords the organization broad diplomatic immunity from lawsuits and other legal action. Beatrice Lindstrom, an attorney for Haitian cholera victims who have filed a suit in U.S. federal courts seeking reparations from the U.N., said an acceptance of culpability could make it more likely that plaintiffs will finally receive financial compensation. \u201cThe U.N. has broad immunity from national courts, but that has always been conditioned on providing remedies out of court to victims who are harmed by U.N. operations,\u201d Lindstrom said. \u201cIt has been in breach of the treaty granting it immunity in the first place, so if the U.N. follows through on remedies, that would make questions of immunity mute.\u201d But Robert Fatton Jr., a Haitian-born political scientist at the University of Virginia, said Haq\u2019s statement amounted to little more than \u201cthe idea that the U.N. might be more receptive to its own criticism.\u201d \u201cWill that entail more _than_ just empty promises to address the problem?\u201d Fatton asked. \u201cThe question is whether the report will lead to some form of compensation for the victims of the epidemic and whether the moral outcry resulting from the U.N.\u2019s irresponsibility will begin to erode the notion that the organization should continue to enjoy diplomatic immunity.\u201d", "Title: A scandal of sexual abuse mars the U.N.\u2019s exit from Haiti Content: THE U.N. PEACEKEEPING mission in Haiti, one of the world\u2019s longest-running such deployments and the only one in the Americas, will end in a few months, but not before reckoning with a fresh scandal. A U.N. battalion of Nepalese peacekeepers in 2010 introduced a lethal strain of cholera to Haiti, where it has since killed more than 9,000 people and infected hundreds of thousands. Now, the Associated Press reports that at least 134 U.N. peacekeepers from Sri Lanka took part in a sex ring in Haiti that victimized nine children, the youngest just 12, from 2004 to 2007. The report should serve notice that U.N. peacekeeping operations worldwide are badly in need of reform and oversight. The sex ring was part of what appears to have been a broader pattern of sexual exploitation and abuse, along with impunity, that has marked the U.N. mission in Haiti since it began in 2004 after an elected president was overthrown. The A.P. turned up hundreds of allegations of abuse in Haiti, many of them coldblooded and horrific, carried out by peacekeepers from Bangladesh, Brazil, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, Uruguay and Sri Lanka. In very few cases did the troops face discipline. The U.N. announcement last week that the mission in Haiti would be wound down over the coming six months was unrelated to the A.P.\u2019s nearly simultaneous revelations of sex abuse by peacekeepers. The troops\u2019 withdrawal \u2014 they\u2019ll be replaced by a much smaller contingent of police trainers \u2014 reflects both the country\u2019s progress toward stabilization after successful elections and financial pressure to trim peacekeeping operations, owing partly to the Trump administration\u2019s threat to cut U.S. contributions to the multinational organization by hundreds of millions of dollars. Even when the mission in Haiti is wrapped up, the United Nations will have more than a dozen peacekeeping missions worldwide; Haiti is by no means the only place peacekeepers have treated as a sexual playground. The United Nations must insist, as a precondition for accepting peacekeeping troops, that contributing countries will court-martial and punish soldiers who commit abuse. It should also sever payments to peacekeeping contingents implicated in sexual abuse if they fail to impose discipline. In the absence of such accountability, peacekeeping missions may do more harm than good. Haiti may have been especially vulnerable to exploitation by peacekeepers as the hemisphere\u2019s poorest nation, leveled by a devastating earthquake in 2010 and a hurricane last year. Some children and teens reportedly were raped outright; others engaged in what victims called \u201csurvival sex,\u201d coerced into trading their bodies for scraps of food or a few dollars. The United Nations insists it is making progress in holding peacekeeper-contributing countries to account; it said much the same thing a decade ago. **Read more on this issue:** The Post\u2019s View: The United Nations comes clean(ish) on cholera in Haiti The Post\u2019s View: The Herculean task facing Haiti Charanya Krishnaswami and Muneer I. Ahmad: U.N. hypocrisy in Haiti", "Title: United Nations must admit its role in Haiti\u2019s cholera outbreak Content: ON THIS page Thursday, the spokesman for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon offered a response \u2014 or something closer to a non-response \u2014 to The Post\u2019s editorial Sunday about the United Nations\u2019 responsibility for, and response to, Haiti\u2019s deadly cholera epidemic . In a letter to the editor, Martin Nesirky, the spokesman, called attention to the United Nations\u2019 wide-ranging and critically important work in providing aid and relief to victims of the cholera outbreak, to improving the country\u2019s infrastructure so that it is less susceptible to such outbreaks in the future and to the pressing need for donors to open their wallets to help implement Haiti\u2019s long-range campaign to eliminate the disease. However, Mr. Nesirky pointedly ignored the editorial\u2019s central focus, which is that the United Nations\u2019 responsibility derives not only from its mission as a major humanitarian relief organization, but also from the growing body of evidence that the cholera outbreak originated with U.N. peacekeepers deployed to Haiti in 2010 following a devastating earthquake. That is the conclusion of a range of experts, including a panel enlisted by the United Nations itself and, most recently, student researchers at Yale Law School and the Yale School of Public Health. It may be the case that lawyers for the United Nations have forbidden the organization\u2019s officials from addressing the topic or even mentioning the battalion of blue-helmeted Nepalese peacekeepers who are widely thought to have introduced the cholera virus into the nation\u2019s largest river and main water supply. Nonetheless, by refusing to acknowledge responsibility, the United Nations jeopardizes its standing and moral authority in Haiti and in other countries where its personnel are deployed. In effect, the United Nations faces two important tasks to address the outbreak, which has killed more than 8,000 people and sickened well over 600,000, and it has undertaken only one. To its credit, the United Nations does seem to be pressing hard to help Haiti eradicate cholera and lessen the effect of the epidemic. And it is useful to remind donors, as Mr. Nesirky did in his letter, that just half of the $444 million goal has been met to fund Haiti\u2019s anti-cholera program. Yet without also speaking frankly about its own responsibility for introducing cholera to Haiti, the organization does a disservice to Haiti and Haitians, who deserve better. **Read more about this issue:** The Post\u2019s View: The United Nations\u2019 duty in Haiti\u2019s cholera outbreak Charanya Krishnaswami and Muneer I.

Stop trying to make church \u2018cool.\u2019 Content: _Rachel Held Evans is a blogger and the author of\u201cSearching for Sunday: Loving, Leaving, and Finding the Church.\u201d _ Bass reverberates through the auditorium floor as a heavily bearded worship leader pauses to invite the congregation, bathed in the light of two giant screens, to tweet using #JesusLives. The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafts in from the lobby, where you can order macchiatos and purchase mugs boasting a sleek church logo. The chairs are comfortable, and the music sounds like something from the top of the charts. At the end of the service, someone will win an iPad. This, in the view of many churches, is what millennials like me want. And no wonder pastors think so. Church attendance has plummeted among young adults. In the United States, 59 percent of people ages 18 to 29 with a Christian background have, at some point, dropped out. According to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, among those of us who came of age around the year 2000, a solid quarter claim no religious affiliation at all, making my generation significantly more disconnected from faith than members of Generation X were at a comparable point in their lives and twice as detached as baby boomers were as young adults. In response, many churches have sought to lure millennials back by focusing on style points: cooler bands, hipper worship, edgier programming, impressive technology. Yet while these aren\u2019t inherently bad ideas and might in some cases be effective, they are not the key to drawing millennials back to God in a lasting and meaningful way. Young people don\u2019t simply want a better show. And trying to be cool might be making things worse. You\u2019re just as likely to hear the words \u201cmarket share\u201d and \u201cbranding\u201d in church staff meetings these days as you are in any corporate office. Megachurches such as Saddleback in Lake Forest, Calif., and Lakewood in Houston have entire marketing departments devoted to enticing new members. Kent Shaffer of ChurchRelevance.com routinely ranks the best logos and Web sites and offers strategic counsel to organizations like Saddleback and LifeChurch.tv. Increasingly, churches offer sermon series on iTunes and concert-style worship services with names like \u201cVine\u201d or \u201cGather.\u201d The young-adult group at Ed Young\u2019s Dallas-based Fellowship Church is called Prime, and one of the singles groups at his father\u2019s congregation in Houston is called Vertical. Churches have made news in recent years for giving away tablet computers , TVs and even cars at Easter. Still, attendance among young people remains flat. __Recentresearch from Barna Group and the Cornerstone Knowledge Network found that 67 percent of millennials prefer a \u201cclassic\u201d church over a \u201ctrendy\u201d one, and 77 percent would choose a \u201csanctuary\u201d over an \u201cauditorium.\u201d While we have yet to warm to the word \u201ctraditional\u201d (only 40 percent favor it over \u201cmodern\u201d), millennials exhibit an increasing aversion to exclusive, closed- minded religious communities masquerading as the hip new places in town. For a generation bombarded with advertising and sales pitches, and for whom the charge of \u201cinauthentic\u201d is as cutting an insult as any, church rebranding efforts can actually backfire, especially when young people sense that there is more emphasis on marketing Jesus than actually following Him. Millennials \u201care not disillusioned with tradition; they are frustrated with slick or shallow expressions of religion,\u201d argues David Kinnaman, who interviewed hundreds of them for Barna Group and compiled his research in \u201cYou Lost Me: Why Young Christians Are Leaving Church . . . and Rethinking Faith.\u201d My friend and blogger Amy Peterson put it this way: \u201cI want a service that is not sensational, flashy, or particularly \u2018relevant.\u2019 I can be entertained anywhere. At church, I do not want to be entertained. I do not want to be the target of anyone\u2019s marketing. I want to be asked to participate in the life of an ancient-future community.\u201d Millennial blogger Ben Irwin wrote: \u201cWhen a church tells me how I should feel (\u2018Clap if you\u2019re excited about Jesus!\u2019), it smacks of inauthenticity. Sometimes I don\u2019t feel like clapping. Sometimes I need to worship in the midst of my brokenness and confusion \u2014 not in spite of it and certainly not in denial of it.\u201d When I left church at age 29, full of doubt and disillusionment, I wasn\u2019t looking for a better-produced Christianity. I was looking for a truer Christianity, a more authentic Christianity: I didn\u2019t like how gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people were being treated by my evangelical faith community. I had questions about science and faith, biblical interpretation and theology. I felt lonely in my doubts. And, contrary to popular belief, the fog machines and light shows at those slick evangelical conferences didn\u2019t make things better for me. They made the whole endeavor feel shallow, forced and fake. While no two faith stories are exactly the same, I\u2019m not the only millennial whose faith couldn\u2019t be saved by lacquering on a hipper veneer. According to Barna Group, among young people who don\u2019t go to church, 87 percent say they see Christians as judgmental, and 85 percent see them as hypocritical. A similar study found that \u201conly 8% say they don\u2019t attend because church is \u2018out of date,\u2019 undercutting the notion that all churches need to do for Millennials is to make worship \u2018cooler.\u2019 \u201d In other words, a church can have a sleek logo and Web site, but if it\u2019s judgmental and exclusive, if it fails to show the love of Jesus to all, millennials will sniff it out. Our reasons for leaving have less to do with style and image and more to do with substantive questions about life, faith and community. We\u2019re not as shallow as you might think. If young people are looking for congregations that authentically practice the teachings of Jesus in an open and inclusive way, then the good news is the church already knows how to do that. The trick isn\u2019t to make church cool; it\u2019s to keep worship weird. You can get a cup of coffee with your friends anywhere, but church is the only place you can get ashes smudged on your forehead as a reminder of your mortality. You can be dazzled by a light show at a concert on any given weekend, but church is the only place that fills a sanctuary with candlelight and hymns on Christmas Eve. You can snag all sorts of free swag for brand loyalty online, but church is the only place where you are named a beloved child of God with a cold plunge into the water. You can share food with the hungry at any homeless shelter, but only the church teaches that a shared meal brings us into the very presence of God. What finally brought me back, after years of running away, wasn\u2019t lattes or skinny jeans; it was the sacraments. Baptism, confession, Communion, preaching the Word, anointing the sick \u2014 you know, those strange rituals and traditions Christians have been practicing for the past 2,000 years. The sacraments are what make the church relevant, no matter the culture or era. They don\u2019t need to be repackaged or rebranded; they just need to be practiced, offered and explained in the context of a loving, authentic and inclusive community. My search has led me to the Episcopal Church, where every week I find myself, at age 33, kneeling next to a gray-haired lady to my left and a gay couple to my right as I confess my sins and recite the Lord\u2019s Prayer. No one\u2019s trying to sell me anything. No one\u2019s desperately trying to make the Gospel hip or relevant or cool. They\u2019re just joining me in proclaiming the great mystery of the faith \u2014 that Christ has died, Christ has risen, and Christ will come again \u2014 which, in spite of my persistent doubts and knee-jerk cynicism, I still believe most days. One need not be an Episcopalian to practice sacramental Christianity. Even in Christian communities that don\u2019t use sacramental language to describe their activities, you see people baptizing sinners, sharing meals, confessing sins and helping one another through difficult times. Those services with big screens and professional bands can offer the sacraments, too. But I believe that the sacraments are most powerful when they are extended not simply to the religious and the privileged, but to the poor, the marginalized, the lonely and the left out. This is the inclusivity so many millennials long for in their churches, and it\u2019s the inclusivity that eventually drew me to the Episcopal Church, whose big red doors are open to all \u2014 conservatives, liberals, rich, poor, gay, straight and even perpetual doubters like me. Church attendance may be dipping, but God can survive the Internet age. After all, He knows a thing or two about resurrection. **_Twitter: @rachelheldevans _ ** Read more from Outlook and follow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.", "Title: How fights over Trump have led evangelicals to leave their churches Content: How did we get here? One answer is sorting. That is, people may reevaluate their religious membership when they sense political (or other) disagreement, leaving their houses of worship more homogeneous organizations. While this happens across the religious spectrum, here we highlight new evidence that disagreement over Trump\u2019s candidacy actually led some evangelicals to leave their church. We surveyed 957 people before and after the 2016 presidential election, in late September and mid-November. Our goal was to gather data to assess how politics might shape church membership. While technically a convenience sample, our surveys \u2014 which were fielded online \u2014 are broadly representative of the American public. Of those who said they had attended a house of worship in September, 14 percent reported that they had left that particular church by mid-November. That\u2019s a proportion in line with several of our previous estimates from surveys in the 2000s. In the 2016 election, \u201cleavers\u201d were distributed across the religious population, and included 10 percent of evangelicals, 18 percent of mainline Protestants, and 11 percent of Catholics. This represents an enormous amount of churn in the religious economy. But was that churn influenced by politics? To find out if they attended a \u201cpolitical church,\u201d we asked respondents if their clergy addressed any of eight political topics. We also asked, more generally, if seeing evidence of politics reminded them of how divisive politics has become. About 15 percent of those who believe that American politics has become divisive left their political houses of worship. Of those who don\u2019t think politics is inherently divisive, close to none left their political house of worship. For some, any mention of politics seems divisive, and they wish to leave it behind at worship. Others don\u2019t mind some mention of politics, but are disturbed by mention of particular political disagreements. Arguably, Trump has been the most divisive candidate in at least recent U.S. history. So was conflicting sentiment about Trump more likely to drive some out of their houses of worship? We wondered this in particular about evangelical Protestants, among whom the question of Trump was hotly debated; some supported him while others were prominently #NeverTrump-ers. In the same survey, we asked evangelicals first to tell us their own level of support for Trump, and second to estimate their clergyperson\u2019s support of Trump. Among this group, Trump\u2019s average feeling thermometer rating \u2014 which ranges from 0 to 100 \u2014 was just over 48. While that\u2019s low, Hillary Clinton\u2019s average was only 25. On average, they felt their clergy liked him only slightly better, averaging 50 on the same 100-point scale. In the figure below, which shows results from a regression model, you can see that those who felt that they and their clergy disagreed over Trump in September were the most likely to report leaving that house of worship by November. The two groups you\u2019d expect were more likely to leave: Trump supporters who felt their clergy didn\u2019t support him (represented by the red line on the left), and those who felt cool toward Trump but thought their clergy strongly supported him (represented by the blue line on the right). More specifically, for 20 years, liberal to moderate evangelicals have been leaving their churches because they disagree with the Christian right. This is important because it allows us to recognize that this sorting process is plural, local, and continual. It is not something owned by the left or right, but a regular and expected part of life in all religious organizations. Are these patterns troubling? Observers\u2019 opinions differ. Religious institutions have long been practice grounds for skills later turned toward politics. On the one hand, if people are leaving houses of worship because of political disagreements, they may not be learning the skills needed to talk across differences and participate in politics. On the other hand, as congregations become more engaged with politics, worshipers learn to connect their values with their political options. And the members most likely to leave over political disagreements tend to be marginal, infrequent attendees anyway.", "Title: How Gregorian chants helped me find my running rhythm Content: It's a question of belief whether divine intervention can help your fitness program, but I can attest that God's music can make you a faster runner. A little more than two years ago, I made the decision to become a healthier person. With the eating habits of a teenager (and a journalist who works the night shift) and the body of a reader, physical health was truly a foreign concept. I had reached my 30s, and it was time for a change. I wanted how I looked on the outside to match how I felt on the inside. So in early 2012, I ran a third of a mile in a D.C. park. It was awful. But it was a start. Then I ran in a 3-mile race, a half marathon and, on a dream trip, my dad and I traveled to Argentina last October, where I ran the Maraton de Buenos Aires. It is South America's largest, with more than 8,000 people running through the famed neighborhoods of Argentina's capital. My goal was to finish, which I did in a time of 4:55:11, averaging nearly 11 minutes per mile. I also adopted the paleo lifestyle and took up CrossFit. I've lost 60 pounds and kept it off, dropped six pants sizes and become more mindful about the decisions I make, and what it means be healthy. When it came time to train for my second marathon, I turned to Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Palestrina wasn't a running coach but a 16th century composer of sacred music. His compositions, still sung in Masses worldwide, helped revolutionize choral music in religious settings in the Western world. Palestrina popularized polyphonic music, the use of two or more vocal melodies incorporated into a single song, in the Latin rite. After much debate (and a few charges of heresy), polyphonic music was added to the Latin Mass and helped start a musical renaissance in the Middle Ages. Before this, most hymns and liturgical songs were sung in what is known as \"plainchant.\" The most famous of this style are Gregorian chants. Said to originate from Pope Gregory the Great in the 7th century, the chants are monophonic, the singing of a phrase or verse as one melody in unison, with no accompanying harmonies. When I first started running, I would listen to whatever was on my Internet streaming station, and to podcasts for longer runs. I found that I had to choose between focusing on what I was hearing or my running. I wasn't getting faster or more consistent and I couldn't summarize the main points of the podcast. A friend recommended I listen to jazz, because the improvisational style can aid in finding rhythm. It didn't help. On a whim, I switched over to the Palestrina station and heard the Gregorian chants. Soon I would find them, well, instrumental to my fitness program. The simplicity of the Gregorian chants helped me focus on that one melody. And unless you know Latin, the words are mysteries. So, you concentrate on the rhythm, rather than the interpretations of the words. Palestrina's motets and hymns enveloped me, completely drowning out the outside world. It was like stepping into a vast cathedral or concert hall and becoming surrounded by the harmonies. They create a meditative experience whose purpose isn't to finish at a certain pace, but rather just to run. After I started listening to the chants on my Sunday morning endurance runs, I told friends that I was attending the \"Church of the Long Run.\" Running became worship of sorts. I found that once I stopped thinking about getting faster and just focused on the moment, I became faster. I finished my last marathon in 4:11:46, an average of 9:37 per mile. I had shaved more than 40 minutes off my Buenos Aires time, with lots of room for improvement. And yes, I was chanting the whole race.

At one point, he aspired to be a monk. He wound up a killer. Of the many details that have emerged about Alexis in the aftermath of the Washington Navy Yard shootings, his interest in Buddhism is among the more surprising. The rampage that left 13 dead, including Alexis, stands in stark contrast to the stereotypical perceptions many Westerners have of Buddhists being serene, nonviolent meditators. Interviews, even with people close to Alexis, paint an incomplete portrait of how the 34-year-old former Navy reservist and computer technician came to Buddhism and how deeply he practiced or believed in the Asian religion, which focuses on easing suffering as the way to enlightenment and does not center on a god. Alexis was very involved with a Fort Worth area temple, but his attendance dropped off after about a year. He drank alcohol regularly and carried a gun, even though his temple banned the practices. Buddhist scripture is full of condemnations of violence, anger and enmity. Even so, some in the Buddhist community see the tragedy as an opportunity to publicly ponder some difficult questions. To what degree is the image of the peaceful Buddhist based in reality? Do Buddhists and Buddhist temples deal directly enough with the topic of mental illness? And might Buddhism hold a special attraction for people who are mentally ill? With its focus on easing emotional and spiritual suffering and its perceived connection in the West to psychology, Buddhism is particularly appealing to \u201cmentally unbalanced people seeking to right the ship of their lives, to self- medicate, to curb their impulses,\u201d said Clark Strand, a contributing editor to the Buddhist publication Tricycle magazine and a former Zen monk. The Navy Yard rampage has resulted in \u201cthe beginning of the conversation that Buddhists are human beings, too,\u201d with human flaws, said the Rev. Danny Fisher, a lay Buddhist minister and a blogger, who runs the Buddhist chaplaincy at the University of the West. \u201cWhich is good, we need to have that.\u201d The relationship, if any, between Alexis\u2019s professed spiritual beliefs and his rampage remains a mystery. Basic details about why, when and how Alexis became interested in Buddhism \u2014 at a tiny Fort Worth area temple filled primarily with Thai immigrants \u2014 were elusive to his roommates and friends. Did Alexis\u2019s regular practice of meditation at the temple in 2010, along with the incense and gold Buddha he kept in his room, ease what he described as post-traumatic stress disorder and hallucinations? Or did he feel ultimately disconnected in his adopted spiritual community, where worship and post- meditation evening chats were in Thai, a language in which he was not fluent? How was he affected, if at all, when his close friend and roommate, a Thai Buddhist, converted to Christianity? Alexis told his Buddhist landlord that he wanted to be a monk, but his attendance at temple services slipped from several times a week in 2010 to about once a month in 2011, before largely fading. He knew of the temple\u2019s ban on drinking and violence, but he considered Heineken beer his drink of choice and carried a gun \u201cat all times,\u201d said Oui Suthamtewakul, a friend and roommate from the temple. Suthamtewakul and his wife, Kristi, run a Thai restaurant called Happy Bowl, where Alexis helped out regularly for several years. Despite living and working closely with Alexis, the couple said they had few answers about how he came to Buddhism and what it meant to him. For at least a year, Alexis was a regular member of the Wat Busayadhammavanaram Meditation Center of Fort Worth, where many evenings he was one of about five people who attended the hour-long silent meditation. (On Sundays, the service was larger; about 20 people would come.) At a special service there Tuesday night, a monk in a deep gold robe told the group that no one can prevent suffering or growing old. Without specifying Alexis\u2019s name, he offered hope that in death, the community\u2019s fallen member would find peace. \u201cI hurt for the people that lost their lives,\u201d said Kathy Saburn, who attends meditation there. And she hurt for Alexis. \u201cThe man obviously was in hell,\u201d she said. Asian immigrants brought Buddhism to the United States in the 1800s, but counterculture figures, including writer Jack Kerouac, brought it to prominence in the years after World War II. Celebrities who took up the cause of Tibet, including actor Richard Gere, raised Buddhism\u2019s profile again in the 1980s, and Americans continue to see Buddhist practices as a healthy alternative to American ambition. From the start, Western Buddhism has overlapped greatly with the field of psychology. Many prominent American teachers of Buddhism were psychologists, and research shows many people pursue meditation to ease psychological stress. \u201cThere are many therapists who are Buddhist or who take materials from Buddhism,\u201d said Charles Jones, a religion and culture professor at Catholic University. He added: \u201cMental illness is largely about suffering, about mental states that cause us to suffer. Buddhism is a religion that has made that a large focus.\u201d Although relatively small, the American Buddhist community is the most diverse in the world. But it tends to cluster: Ethnic groups of Asians generally have their own temples, and other Buddhists with higher incomes and educations tend to follow what Strand calls \u201cthe upper-middle way.\u201d Thai Buddhists are part of the Theravada tradition, which is common across South Asia and Southeast Asia and claims to be the oldest and most authentic form of Buddhism, Jones said. A characteristic of Theravada is the huge range of meditation techniques. \u201cA quotation you find in Theravada literature would be something like . . . \u2018The Buddha is the doctor who has the 84,000 medicines for the 84,000 illnesses,\u2019\u201d Jones said. Whether Alexis was able to access such teachings is unclear. Non-Asian Buddhists in America, Jones said, tend to belong to the Theravada, Zen and Tibetan branches, yet generally they are separate from ethnically Buddhist communities. \u201cHe might have found some real cultural barriers and a lack of understanding if he was trying to practice there,\u201d Jones said. Somsak Srisan, who was Alexis\u2019s former landlord in Fort Worth and knew him from the temple, said Alexis spoke about leaving his job at a local Navy base, but not in depth. They also spoke superficially about Alexis\u2019s interest in becoming a Buddhist monk. \u201cHe was looking for some way for his life,\u201d Srisan said. \u201cLooking for something to be a guideline for him.\u201d ****To some, the Navy Yard rampage raises difficult questions about Buddhism and meditation as ways to improve mental health, especially for people who delve deeply into meditation but may not have a well-developed understanding of Buddhism\u2019s history and theology. \u201cMeditation alone may have no effect whatsoever on one\u2019s morals and hence overall life,\u201d wrote Justin Whitaker, a Buddhist ethicist, in his blog American Buddhist Perspectives. \u201cAnd it might also, as many people find out early in the process, actually open up deeper layers of pain, anger, and guilt that have been effectively repressed.\u201d The possibility that Alexis tried meditation to ease his mental suffering prompted Strand to wonder whether he might have sought out Buddhism \u201cas a last hope to avert this tragedy.\u201d \u201cIt may be that he was seeking a meditative discipline that would help him to get a handle on that or to learn to work with those voices to still them or to give his mind something else to do,\u201d Strand said, referring to reports that Alexis was haunted by mysterious voices. \u201cBuddhism tends not to be a quick fix for such stuff.\u201d Leslie Minora in Fort Worth contributed to this report.", "Title: Religion events from around the Washington area Content: **Saturdays, Sundays and weekdays, open and on view all day:** Artist Bjorn Skaarup\u2019s \u201cCarnival of the Animals,\u201d an exhibit of eight bronze works displayed outside Washington National Cathedral, adjacent to the west front.

The authors said the findings show that disease from air and household pollution ranks as the number two cause of death worldwide. It comes in right behind smoking, which the World Health Organization says kills 6 million people annually. The research, part of an initiative to monitor the global burden of disease, is being presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington. Air pollution is made up of fine particulate matter from power generation, transportation and open burning. Household pollution is created by stoves that burn coal, wood and animal dung for cooking and heat, primarily in India and Africa. Both can lead to heart attacks and strokes, and the researchers found that nearly 1 million people die annually from these causes in China, more than a half-million die in India, and nearly 300,000 die in the United States and European Union countries. Although the report used 2013 data, co-author Dan Greenbaum, president of the nonprofit Health Effects Institute in Boston, noted that \u201cthese things don\u2019t change overnight.\u201d Last year\u2019s death toll likely was similar, he said. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Chinese government is moving aggressively to improve air quality by forcing automobiles there to be equipped with cleaner technology, and power plants to lower the amount of particulates they spew. But gains are offset by the country\u2019s drive to become a world economic power \u2014 through the very industries it seeks to better regulate. The United States, where yearly deaths from air pollution fell from 119,000 to 79,000 between 1990 and 2013, and the European Union, where they fell from 350,000 to 218,000 over the same period, stand as models for China, Greenbaum said. The United States continues to push for lower emissions from automobile traffic and has imposed stronger rules on industry, such as cement plants and those that generate electricity from coal. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico China\u2019s worsening air pollution is a problem far beyond its borders, with previous studies showing that it marginally increases air pollution on the U.S. West Coast. At the AAAS meeting, Greenbaum said, a Chinese scientist is set to present an analysis showing that \u201ccoal is by far the largest health burden, about 50 percent of the problem.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Report co-author Qiao Ma, a doctoral student at the School of Environment at Tsinghua University in Beijing, found that outdoor air pollution from coal contributed to about 366,000 Chinese deaths in 2013. According to her projection, between 990,000 and 1.3 million people there will lose their lives prematurely by 2030 unless ambitious pollution-reduction targets are introduced. \u201cOur study highlights the urgent need for even more aggressive strategies to reduce emissions from coal and from other sectors,\u201d Ma said in a statement. Air pollution is \u201cby far the leading environmental risk factor for disease,\u201d Michael Brauer, another co-author and professor at the University of British Columbia\u2019s School of Population and Public Health in Vancouver, said in the statement. \u201cReducing air pollution is an incredibly efficient way to improve the health of a population.\u201d India has moved to reduce household pollution, but not with the same urgency as China. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to solve the household problems because these are poor families that can\u2019t convert to electric stoves,\u201d Greenbaum said. \u201cPeople who are in the kitchen, women primarily, are exposed to extremely high levels of pollution.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But Indian officials are intent on regulating what they can, said Chandra Venkataraman, a professor of chemical engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who analyzed pollution there as part of the report. Emission standards legislation has been introduced in the wake of the international climate agreement reached last December in Paris. And policies are in place to move the country from coal-burning heavy industry. Venkataraman said officials also want to end a standard Indian practice of widespread burning to clear agricultural fields. As part of a national cook-stove initiative, about 110 million households now have stoves that burn bio-matter, she said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut it\u2019s not a centralized problem, it\u2019s all over the country.

Maybe Mr. Trump really believes there are enough \u201csuperfluous\u201d EPA programs \u2014 such as, apparently, those addressing climate change \u2014 that his administration will throw out only bathwater and no baby. In reality, focusing only on the pollution challenges of the past, not those of the present or the future, ignores vast volumes of evidence on the ecological and human damage various types of pollution still cause. Imagine what the country would be like now if politicians had folded years ago to industry complaints about environmental protections now considered rudimentary. Actually, you may not have to imagine. A group of American and Canadian researchers recently released a global air pollution death toll, finding that two major types of air pollution were associated with 4.2 million deaths in 2015, which was a staggering 7.6 percent of all deaths. \u201cStudies of long-term exposure to air pollution demonstrate that people living in more polluted locations die prematurely, compared with those living in areas with lower levels of pollution,\u201d the report explained. The other side of the coin is that \u201cwhen air quality improves, so does population health.\u201d Fine particulates from fuel burning, among other things, penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream, encouraging heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, chronic lung disease and respiratory infections. The researchers concluded that exposure to particulate pollution was the fifth deadliest health risk of all 79 they studied, ranking behind high blood pressure, smoking and high blood sugar, and about matching high cholesterol \u2014 conditions many people upend their lives in order to mitigate. Air pollution exposure was deadlier than having high body mass index or alcohol use. No wonder the EPA has cited reductions in particulate matter to justify many Obama-era clean air regulations. Decades of environmental rules have resulted in relatively low \u2014 though not necessarily comfortable \u2014 particulate pollution levels in the United States and other developed nations. American air could still be cleaner; the researchers found that the nation\u2019s levels of ozone \u2014 which also contributes to respiratory disease \u2014 were about the same as Nigeria\u2019s and higher than China\u2019s. Yet Americans do not know how good they have it. Fully 92 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in areas where fine-particulate levels exceed World Health Organization guidelines. The misery is concentrated: Half of air pollution\u2019s death toll was in China and India alone. Some particulate pollution is natural. But humans burning things \u2014 such as coal \u2014 is also a principle driver. Some of the pollution, such as that from archaic cooking and heating stoves, might abate with economic development. Yet if that very development relies on ramping up coal burning, people\u2019s health will still be threatened. Beyond appreciation for effective environmental enforcement, there are at least two lessons. First, major developing nations such as China and India must find a way to grow their economies without substantially degrading their air quality. Second, if world governments continue to press major developing nations on cross-border pollution matters, they will be aided by popular internal demand for cleaner air. **Read more here:** Letters to the Editor: Environmental protection shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue The Post\u2019s View: If Trump wants to gut climate regulations, he\u2019d better have a good alternative Letters to the Editor: Pruitt will enable irreversible pollution of our atmosphere Eugene Robinson: Trump can\u2019t deny climate change without a fight David Ignatius: Not even Trump can easily reverse our progress on climate change", "Title: An outdoor exerciser? Here\u2019s what your lungs probably look like. Content: When a pathologist at Georgetown University\u2019s medical school cut into the lungs of a cadaver during an autopsy and revealed blackened tissue, one of my medical students assumed that smoking must have contributed to the person\u2019s death. No, the pathologist said; he\u2019d seen such carbon-pocked lungs hundreds of times. \u201cThat\u2019s what all our lungs look like.\u201d The truth is that air pollution damages our lungs not only in places such as Beijing and New Delhi, where smoggy air and white masks have become a way of life for many. U.S. air may not look as gritty, but Americans living in high-density areas, even suburban ones, also face plenty of negative health consequences from pollution, including heart attacks and asthma. A recent study found that 5.5 million people worldwide die prematurely every year because of dirty air, much of it from power plants and,especially in the United States, automobiles. Particulate and gaseous pollutants in the air have been blamed for as many as 10 percent of deaths in Los Angeles. So what are we breathing that\u2019s causing such damage? Our air has two forms of pollution; one of them includes gases such as ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Of these, ground-level ozone is a major respiratory culprit, created when sunlight interacts with exhausts from vehicles and other machinery. Ozone is a potent lung irritant and is partly responsible for the rise in rhinitis and asthma worldwide. The warmer the air, the greater the reaction. Recent studies have determined ozone to be the pollutant most closely associated with increased mortality. The other form of pollution is tiny particulate matter \u2014 from automobile fumes, power plants and smoke from chimneys and forest fires \u2014 that lodges in the lungs and pretty much stays there. Particulates are what blacken our lungs over time, but both ozone and particulates cause breathing problems and shorten life spans by making lungs sensitive to allergic substances, causing inflammation and reducing lung function. These changes trigger asthma attacks, worsen illnesses such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, and are even linked to the development of lung cancer. The smaller particulates are, the more dangerous their effect. One common particulate goes by the scientific name PM 2.5. Its tiny dimensions \u2014 it\u2019s often described as being one-thirtieth as wide as a hair \u2014 allow it to enter the deepest recesses of the lungs. We take in millions of them with each breath. PM 2.5s are made up of sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. While some of these components occur naturally in the air, others come from burning coal and wood, fuel combustion and other human activities. No one knows exactly which of these man-made ingredients are most toxic to the lungs. What is clear is that the particles\u2019 minuscule size allow them to stay in the air for long periods, travel great distances and, worst of all, evade the body\u2019s defenses. They pass right by the small hairs in our nose and bronchial tree, which are better suited for trapping larger particles. The Environmental Protection Agency and the American Lung Association are among several organizations with websites that provide information on ozone and particulates in many U.S. cities. For 2014, the District received an \u201cF\u201d grade from the ALA \u2014 eighth-worst in the country \u2014 for ozone levels, calculated from hourly readings at monitoring sites over a three-year period. (Recent studies have determined ozone to be the pollutant most closely associated with increased mortality.) The District received a \u201cD\u201d for particulates. Los Angeles topped the list for worst ozone pollution and the area around Fresno, Calif., ranked highest for particulates. Some U.S. cities fared better: Anchorage had the lowest level of ozone pollution in the country, whereas Prescott, Ariz., had the lowest levels of particulates. The cleanest city in the world was Calgary, Alberta. Meanwhile, clean-air tourists would do well to steer away from Linfen, China, the world\u2019s most polluted city. Whose health is most at risk? People older than 65, who tend to have less efficient lungs and immune systems, and children, who spend more time outdoors and have higher respiratory rates than adults, are particularly sensitive to ozone, as is anyone with asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. People of all ages living near high-traffic roads and other sources of pollution, such as smokestacks, have been found to have more health issues, including cardiovascular risk and lung disease, than other people. What about athletes in urban areas who inhale automobile exhaust while running and cycling outdoors? Exercisers inhale particles through the mouth, bypassing the nasal filtration system, and often draw the inflammatory particles deep into the lungs. Exercise, however, is definitely good for your cardiovascular system and probably offsets some of the cardiovascular health risks of living in a polluted environment. What should urban dwellers do? If you\u2019re not going to move to Anchorage or Canada, you can still protect yourself and limit your contribution to air pollution. The ALA suggests driving less and reducing the use of gas-powered tools, air conditioning and wood-burning fireplaces. It also recommends staying indoors on high-pollution days and avoiding exercise near zones of heavy traffic. Short of using cans of imported air from Canada, as we now hear is all the rage in China, some people have suggested using the face masks many in Beijing now wear as a barrier to toxic air. Such masks, which were popularized in Japan after the 1918 flu, have continued to be used worldwide in surgical settings and have served as a public health measure to protect against airborne infections. Some masks \u2014 labeled N95 and N99 \u2014 provide protection against most of the worrisome airborne particles. However, they can be uncomfortable to wear \u2014 they\u2019re thicker and less flexible than a surgical mask \u2014 and reduce airflow, creating a sensation of difficulty breathing. I\u2019ve tried an N95 respirator mask for running and an N95 plain face mask for cycling. In both cases the exertion made breathing more difficult. And because the masks make you look like a giant irradiated bug, I drew incredulous stares when I wore one biking down a congested part of River Road in Bethesda. Some companies have addressed this problem by attempting to recast masks as hip urban fashion statements. Others have created personal environmental monitors, which keep track of air quality and communicate with a smartphone to help you figure out when to don a mask. These masks and apps may help give a sense of control, but they\u2019re not long-term solutions. That\u2019s why some organizations are focusing on the respiratory health of future generations. We can\u2019t get rid of those black spots dotting our lungs; our best bet is to keep young lungs pink in the first place. **Read more:** What it\u2019s like for me living in Beijing\u2019s polluted air Reports says more than 5 million people die prematurely due to air pollution The staggering economic cost of air pollution Air pollution is killing 1.6 million people a year in China"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "The passage directly compares air pollution in India and China, stating that air quality in India has worsened while it has improved in China.", "listwise_reason": "This passage provides the most comprehensive and relevant information in relation to the query, including specific data on particulate matter levels and the impact of pollution control measures in both countries.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Analysts looked at NASA satellite images and found that measurements of particulate matter -- the microscopic particles that invade your lungs and can cause cancer and heart disease -- improved impressively in China over the past few years while air quality in India has worsened, with 2015 ranking as India\u2019s most polluted year on record."}, {"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage is identical to passage 2, and therefore provides the same direct evidence and reasoning.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage is equally relevant as passage 2, it is ranked lower due to being a duplicate.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Analysts looked at NASA satellite images and found that measurements of particulate matter -- the microscopic particles that invade your lungs and can cause cancer and heart disease -- improved impressively in China over the past few years while air quality in India has worsened, with 2015 ranking as India\u2019s most polluted year on record."}, {"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "The passage mentions that a large number of deaths occur in India and China due to air pollution, but it does not directly compare the two countries or suggest that one is more dangerous than the other.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage provides relevant background information on the impact of air pollution, it lacks the specific comparative data provided in passages 2 and 3.", "direct_answer_sentence": "About 5.5 million people around the world die prematurely every year from breathing polluted air, and the majority of those deaths are occurring in China and India, where factories and coal-fired power plants are fueling economic growth."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the global impact of air pollution and its health effects, but does not specifically compare India and China or provide evidence to support the query.", "listwise_reason": "This passage provides less relevant information than the others, as it does not directly address the query or provide specific information on air pollution in India and China.", "direct_answer_sentence": "A group of American and Canadian researchers recently released a global air pollution death toll, finding that two major types of air pollution were associated with 4.2 million deaths in 2015, which was a staggering 7.6 percent of all deaths."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the impact of air pollution on lung health and mentions the global death toll from air pollution, but does not specifically compare India and China or provide evidence to support the query.", "listwise_reason": "This passage provides less relevant information than the others, as it does not directly address the query or provide specific information on air pollution in India and China.", "direct_answer_sentence": "A recent study found that 5.5 million people worldwide die prematurely every year because of dirty air, much of it from power plants and, especially in the United States, automobiles."}]}, "scores": [19.890899658203125, 18.278099060058594, 18.27809715270996, 17.74370002746582, 16.67259979248047]}

Remember, this was well before the common use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs; in many ways, you could make an argument that the drugs of choice in our clubhouse were more performance reducing than anything else.\u201d It is already well known that, going back to the 1940\u2019s, baseball players have been fond of amphetamines as a way of boosting energy at various points during the long season. As Darling alluded to with his mention of \u201cperformance reducing\u201d drugs, the \u201986 Mets built a well-deserved reputation for partying, so the fact that many members of that squad were also fond of uppers is not a major surprise. But the former pitcher had some interesting tales to tell of his teammates\u2019 need for speed. \u201cYou\u2019d see guys toward the end of a game, maybe getting ready for their final at bat, double-back into the locker room to chug a beer to \u2018re-kick the bean\u2019 so they could step to the plate completely wired and focused and dialed in,\u201d Darling wrote. \u201cThey had it down to a science, with precision timing. They\u2019d do that thing where you poke a hole in the can so the beer would flow shotgun-style. They\u2019d time it so that they were due to hit third or fourth that inning, and in their minds that rush of beer would kind of jump-start the amphetamines and get back to how they were feeling early on in the game \u2014 pumped, jacked, good to go.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2006 that MLB officially banned amphetamines, so those Mets weren\u2019t necessarily doing anything prohibited by the sport, nor that their opponents were shunning. Certainly, Darling, who implied that starting pitchers such as himself were less fond of amphetamines, didn\u2019t seem to suggest that what his teammates were doing was particularly wrong \u2014 it was just the way of things at the time. \u201cThese pick-me-up type drugs were just a way to mask or chase the pain,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey were part of the landscape; they\u2019d been around the game for generations. In the era of Mays and Aaron, the heroes of my growing up, it was all about red juice or Cuban coffee \u2014 the brews found in virtually every clubhouse, spiked with amphetamines and whatever else the prevailing \u2018wisdom\u2019 suggested.\u201d Darling started Game 7 of the 1986 World Series, allowing three earned runs to the Red Sox in less than four innings. However, the Mets staged a comeback and won the game, and their most recent championship, by an 8-5 score.", "Title: Speed and other recreational stimulants are tied to heart damage Content: Middle-aged adults who use recreational amphetamines such as speed, ecstasy or ice may develop a prematurely aging heart and experience health problems normally associated with older people, a recent study suggests. People may crave the euphoric feelings produced by amphetamines, but these drugs have long been linked to heart attack, stroke, artery wall damage, bleeding in the brain, abnormal heart rhythm and sudden cardiac death, said lead study author Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia. \u201cIt makes sense that all these different issues are linked by an underlying acceleration of the aging effect,\u201d Reece said by email. \u201cWe found that the effect was very considerable indeed.\u201d Amphetamines are a stimulant, and they send what\u2019s known as the \u201cfight or flight\u201d hormone adrenaline into overdrive. Previous research has linked these drugs to premature aging of the skin; the Australian research suggests amphetamines might also prematurely age the heart. For the study, researchers measured blood flow through a main artery in the upper arm and forearm for 713 people in their 30s and 40s at a clinic for substance misuse. Arteries harden with age. Each patient was asked about drug use and placed in one of four groups: nonsmokers, smokers, amphetamine users and methadone users. (Methadone is given to people trying to overcome addiction to heroin.) Researchers used a blood pressure cuff and monitoring system to calculate what they described as biological vascular age by matching the extent of hardening in the arteries with the participants\u2019 chronological age, gender and height. The number of amphetamine users in the study was relatively small \u2014 55. Almost all of them said they had used these stimulants within the previous week, and about half had used the drugs in the day before being tested with the blood pressure cuffs. Even after accounting for several risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as weight, cholesterol levels and inflammation, amphetamine use was still independently associated with an \u201cadvancement\u201d of cardiovascular age, researchers report in the journal Heart Asia. The accelerated aging seen with amphetamines appeared to be even more pronounced than that seen with tobacco use, and it was equivalent to about a 25 percent increase over chronological age, Reece said \u2014 in other words, giving an otherwise average 40-year-old a cardiovascular age of around 50. Beyond the small number of amphetamine users in the study, another limitation is the lack of data on how much of the stimulants people used, the authors note. Stimulants such as Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta are often prescribed to children and adults diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in doses that are not associated with cardiovascular problems. \u201cAt therapeutic doses, stimulant medications have been shown to be safe,\u201d said Jose Martinez-Raga, a researcher at Spain\u2019s University of Valencia, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAmphetamine abuse implies using these stimulant drugs over long periods of time and generally with much larger doses than those commonly prescribed for medical reasons,\u201d Martinez-Raga added by email. All stimulants work by increasing the amount of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical linked to pleasure, movement and attention. People who take amphetamines in doses higher than is typically prescribed can experience a rapid surge of dopamine that can trigger euphoria and increase the risk of addiction. \u201cNo medical patient smokes or shoots their pills,\u201d Reece said. \u201cThese high levels are very addictive, they are very damaging, and they produce great spikes in blood pressure and heart rate which are straining and damaging both for the heart itself and for the blood vessels.\u201d ** \u2014 Reuters **", "Title: \u2018Microbeads\u2019 soon will be banned from toothpaste and soaps Content: Congress and the White House are coming after your toothpaste, facial scrubs and body wash. Beginning in mid-2017, tiny plastic beads found in some bath and beauty products will be prohibited. The ban, which President Obama signed into law in late December, is aimed at the billions of \u201cmicrobeads\u201d that some researchers estimate wash down U.S. drains every day, slip through sewage treatment plants and end up being eaten by fish in lakes, rivers and oceans. \u201cThis is huge,\u201d said Julie Lawson, executive director of Trash Free Maryland, an environmental group that helped push through a state ban on microbeads last year. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to get these products off the shelves. We\u2019re trying to get manufacturers to change the way they make them.\u201d The tiny plastic beads are most often used as mild abrasives to exfoliate skin and strip away dirt and oil. They also put the colorful sparkle in some toothpastes and help fill in wrinkles in some \u201cage-defying\u201d make-up. Congressional researchers say hundreds of products contain microbeads and that a single bottle or tube can have hundreds of thousands of the tiny particles. Once they wash down drains and reach sewage treatment plants, they can slip through filters that weren\u2019t designed for such small particles and end up discharged into waterways, where they look like tiny eggs. Fish that eat them can suffer problems, researchers say, and end up on dinner plates. Drinking water drawn from the same waterways with the beads isn\u2019t considered a risk, environmental activists say, because water filtration plants screen out smaller contaminants than sewage treatment facilities. \u201cThey are so small, and there are so many of them,\u201d said George S. Hawkins, general manager of D.C. Water, which provides drinking water in Washington and sewage treatment for the city and surrounding suburbs. \u201cThe worry was they\u2019re getting through our systems and into rivers and becoming part of the food chain.\u201d While there\u2019s been relatively little research into the prevalence of beads in waterways, the problem drew national attention in 2013, after a study found colorful microbeads in the Great Lakes. A 2015 study estimated that, nationwide, 808 billion beads are washed down drains daily. Up to 99 percent of those probably settle out at the sewage treatment plant and end up in leftover sludge, those researchers said. However, even the relatively scant numbers that get through treatment plants amount to an estimated 8 billion daily reaching waterways, the study found. John Hurson, who oversees government affairs for the Personal Care Products Council, said manufacturers can replace the beads with natural materials, such as sand, sugar or ground-up walnut shells. It\u2019s unclear how the change will affect product costs, he said. He said companies used the plastic beads because they\u2019re safe, non-allergenic and gentle on the skin. But he said some companies, particularly European manufacturers, began discontinuing them voluntarily in the early 2000s, after a late-1990s study raised the possibility that they were getting through sewage treatment facilities. Hurson said the industry is responsible for a \u201cminuscule portion\u201d of microplastics found in waterways because they also come from clothing fibers, boat paint particles and degrading plastic bags and bottles. Even so, he said, the industry supported environmental groups\u2019 calls for a national standard on microbeads after at least eight states passed similar bans in the past two years. \u201cIt made sense to us to be very supportive of a national phaseout,\u201d Hurson said. Even with limited scientific data on a relatively new issue, the legislation enjoyed an unusual level of bipartisan support, sailing through Congress with little controversy. \u201cThis is a very strange example of the policy being quicker than the science,\u201d said Chelsea Rochman, one of the researchers on the 2015 study. \u201cBut we know enough about microplastics to know they\u2019re a concern for wildlife.\u201d The federal ban, activists said, goes further than the state laws because it takes effect sooner and doesn\u2019t allow exceptions. It pertains only to microbeads in toothpaste and \u201crinse-off\u201d products, so it doesn\u2019t cover those in deodorants, lotions or make-up. It also doesn\u2019t affect plastic abrasives in household cleaners.", "Title: Here\u2019s what Florida\u2019s massive toxic algae bloom looks like from space Content: By now, you may have seen pictures of the foul-smelling, tourist-repelling, guacamole-thick algae that has been spreading along some South Florida waterways, including along the state\u2019s \u201cTreasure Coast.\u201d According to NASA, the algae bloom that grew this spring covered roughly 33 square miles of Lake Okeechobee. The conditions that gave rise to the bloom have persisted ever since, and have been blamed for affecting water quality downstream all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. How did the algae bloom spread far beyond the shores of Lake Okeechobee? In part, it\u2019s because the Army Corps of Engineers, which monitors water levels in the lake, had to make a decision as water levels continued to rise from huge amounts of rainfall. The Corps discharged excess water from the lake into rivers and estuaries that lead to the coast in order to avoid putting thousands of people and the towns they live in near the lake at risk of life-threatening flooding. That discharge flowed through the St. Lucie Canal on the lake\u2019s eastern side into the Atlantic Ocean near Stuart, Fla. With it came the hideous algae that state officials are now scrambling to contain. Last week, Gov. Rick Scott (R) declared a state of emergency in multiple counties after algae blooms appeared in local waterways. On Wednesday, Scott vowed to push state legislators to spend millions to fight the bloom, which residents have described as smelling like \u201ca hundred dead animals.\u201d He also appealed to President Obama to declare a federal emergency in the area, saying that the blooms have caused \u201chavoc to our environment.\u201d The algae and their toxins can disrupt ecosystems, choking the oxygen out of waterways and threatening fish, birds and other wildlife. It also can present risks to human health.

Residents of Shiprock, N.M., a Navajo Nation community roughly 130 miles downstream from the spill, could expect to see the plume arrive in a couple of days. All irrigation systems would be turned off, and drinking water would be drawn from an emergency supply stored in tanks in town. Kim Howe, a young farmer in Shiprock, was stricken. \u201cI had nothing else to do but cry,\u201d she told The Washington Post in a telephone interview. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Howe relies on the town irrigation system to water her eight acres of corn, alfalfa and assorted other vegetables, and her income depends on trading her harvest at the end of the summer.

All along the three affected waterways \u2014 Cement Creek, where the waste was spilled, Colorado\u2019s Animas River and the San Juan \u2014 communities have clamored for explanations from the Environmental Protection Agency about the cause and possible consequences of the spill.

So far the agency says it hasn\u2019t heard any negative health reports from the site of the spill, and area animals seem to be doing okay. When officials placed cages full of more than 100 fish directly in the mustard-stained river, all but one of them survived. Wild birds with stains on their wings were still able to fly, and no fish die-offs have been reported. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Still, EPA officials have been tight lipped about the exact level of toxins and their possible health threats. They say they need more time to test the water and analyze their results, though preliminary results are promising. That hasn\u2019t quelled questions and frustrations from people in the affected area. Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye declared a state of emergency Saturday and pledged to sue the EPA to make it pay for its mistake. \u201cAt this point, how long are we going to continue to truck in water? Who\u2019s going to pick up the tab? Are we going to hold these people accountable?

The mine was one of several that have been leaching acid and other toxins into waterways for years, killing all the local fish, and the EPA has previously considered designating the area a \u201cSuperfund\u201d site. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But residents resisted the intervention, and instead the agency came to an agreement that let local officials direct the cleanup effort. They were only a few weeks into the project when the plug failed, unleashing millions of gallons of wastewater and a new stream of headaches for the EPA. As of Wednesday, the plume continues to move along the San Juan and is expected to reach Arizona\u2019s Lake Powell later this week. From there, the water will flow into the Colorado River, which supplies drinking water Las Vegas, Los Angeles and much of the Southwest. But the threat to Lake Powell and the Colorado seems minimal, officials said. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokeswoman Justyn Liff said the 3 million gallon spill was about the size of 4\u00bd Olympic- sized pools. By contrast, Lake Powell contains 4.2 trillion gallons of water, comparable to 6.4 million Olympic-sized pools. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Along the Animas and San Juan, the EPA has said that the river flows too quickly for the contaminants to cause an immediate health threat, and heavy metals that will sink to the bottom of the waterways will likely be diluted over time.

It was the latest assault on forces loyal to a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led military campaign to restore Yemen\u2019s exiled government to power. The assault unfolded shortly after 4 p.m. as soldiers waited at the gate of the Solaban military base to collect their salaries in the port city, witnesses said. They had not been paid since September. \u201cA suicidal bomber sneaked in among the soldiers who were standing in line and blew himself up,\u201d Mansour Saleh, a local journalist, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThis is not the first time this base was attacked.\u201d The bombing came days after Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi returned to Aden after spending months outside Yemen, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The Health Ministry said that the bombing killed 48 soldiers and that 36 were reported wounded, but the number of fatalities could rise, officials said . No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but suspicion immediately fell on al-Qaeda\u2019s powerful Yemen branch as well as the Islamic State. Both groups are widely believed to have cells inside Aden and have claimed to have staged previous attacks on soldiers and officials in Aden, including one targeting Solaban a few months ago that killed more than a dozen people. In August, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in a mustering area for army recruits, killing at least 54 people, one of the worst suicide attacks to strike the country. In May, suicide bombers in Aden killed at least 45 army recruits lined up to enlist. The conflict pits Hadi\u2019s forces against an alliance of northern rebels known as the Houthis and loyalists of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. In early 2015, shortly after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa, Hadi fled and eventually based his government in Aden. A regional coalition led by Saudi Arabia, and supported by Washington, intervened in the conflict but has failed to push the rebels from the capital despite a steady barrage of airstrikes. The Sunni Muslim kingdom and its partners are wary of the Shiite Houthis and their suspected ties to Iran\u2019s theocracy. The conflict has worsened a humanitarian crisis afflicting the country, the Middle East\u2019s poorest. The United Nations estimates that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them civilians.", "Title: It\u2019s going to be a long fight Content: U.S. leadership of the war on terrorism has entered its second phase. Dealing with Islamic State forces in Iraq is just another leg of the fight. Deciding to expand U.S. bombing to Syria with the goal of destroying the terrorist group\u2019s leadership and about two-thirds of its fighters will take years. Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had a warning for those who thought a quick dose of U.S. firepower could do the trick. At a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting Tuesday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) asked what would be required \u201cto destroy them [the Islamic State] within 90 days.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not possible, Senator,\u201d Dempsey replied. \u201cWe could destroy a lot of equipment; we could drive them underground, if you will. But as I said, they will only be defeated or destroyed once they\u2019re rejected by the populations in which they hide.\u201d The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were the Pearl Harbor of this war on terrorism, and Osama bin Laden\u2019s al-Qaeda was only the beginning. Bin Laden showed other terrorist leaders how to gain attention, along with recruits and financial support: Challenge the world\u2019s major superpower. His goal in bringing down the World Trade Center, hitting the Pentagon and killing thousands of Americans was to force the Bush administration\u2019s withdrawal from the Middle East, where his real targets were Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal family and the secular leaders in Egypt, Libya and Iraq. Bin Laden was wrong about the United States. The country rallied around Bush, and core al-Qaeda \u2014 which was never large \u2014 saw its operations disrupted, senior leaders captured or killed, and its financial support squeezed. Yet, even bin Laden\u2019s death has not ended al-Qaeda\u2019s threat to the United States. Offshoots have appeared in Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, North Africa and Syria \u2014 primarily where Sunni or other groups felt mistreated by their own governments. All required U.S. attention. Extensive intelligence activities at home and abroad, helped by some luck, have allowed the country to escape another major terrorist attack \u2014 aside from the bombing last year at the Boston Marathon. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State, has emerged as a major threat, thanks to his brutality, public relations skills, and military successes in Iraq and Syria. He topped it all with horrendous beheadings of two American journalists and a British aid worker. Those acts showed that Baghdadi had learned from bin Laden \u2014 but in a simpler, bloody way \u2014 how he could get the attention of Americans and the world. Now what? Such a terrorist group \u201cwill only be defeated when moderate Arab and Muslim populations in the region reject it,\u201d Dempsey told the Senate panel Tuesday. \u201cAnd therefore, the way forward seems to me to run clearly through a coalition of Arab and Muslim partners and not through the ownership of the United States in this issue.\u201d The plan is to get the new Baghdad government to reach out to Sunni areas where the Islamic State, according to Dempsey, has either \u201ccoerced or co-opted or driven away\u201d about 48 to 54 Sunni tribes. U.S. military teams have assessed that 26 of 50 Iraqi army brigades \u201care capable of partnering\u201d with U.S. air support. Getting forces on the offensive in the west and north of Iraq, while the Kurds, with U.S. support, press from the north to the south, \u201cI think will place [the Islamic State] in an untenable position,\u201d Dempsey said. Syria is much harder. First, there is no central party to work with there. The Syrian moderate military units that the United States hopes to develop need \u201ca chain of command responsive to some Syrian political structure, not responsive to us,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cThese can\u2019t be simply surrogates and proxies; they have to be tied, linked to some political structure that ultimately could assist in the governing of Syria when finally the Assad regime is either overthrown or, through the negotiation, is changed.\u201d Another problem is that the U.S. plan envisions training just 5,000 fighters a year, in small groups that go through in eight-week cycles. The first three to five months, however, will be devoted to setting up training facilities primarily in Saudi Arabia, then recruiting mostly among refugees outside Syria. \u201cWe think we\u2019ll be recruiting mostly from displaced populations, and therefore it won\u2019t be as though they\u2019re giving up the security of their families to come and train with us,\u201d Dempsey said. This fighting force\u2019s task is to go after Islamic State targets in Syria, aided by U.S.-directed air power. \u201cThe number that our military planners were considering was about 12,000,\u201d Dempsey said at the hearing. The U.S.-trained Syrians would not be the only forces on the ground, according to Dempsey. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me how does the opposition in Syria finally prevail against [the Islamic State], I think it\u2019s going to require the assistance of, in particular, Jordanians and probably some of the Syrian Kurds, and probably the Turks.\u201d President Obama and top administration officials need to prepare the country for this next phase. This will not be quick, though the number of Americans on the ground will not be great. Clearly, however, it is a work in progress with no guaranteed end in sight.", "Title: A dangerous mission in Libya requires a firm approach Content: THE PENTAGON says it thinks a U.S. airstrike in Libya on Sunday may have killed one of the most dangerous terrorists in Africa, a man believed to have led a 2013 attack on an Algerian gas field that killed 38 civilians, including three Americans. Meanwhile, al-Qaeda has confirmed that its leader in Yemen was killed by a U.S. drone strike last week. It\u2019s good those two militants have been taken off the battlefield, but their elimination will not remedy the growing crises in Libya and Yemen. In that respect, the operations are another example of the limited benefits of President Obama\u2019s narrow approach to counterterrorism. For years, Mr. Obama has authorized drone strikes and raids against individuals designated as threats to the United States in Libya, Yemen and Somalia, while making only attenuated efforts to support the construction of stable governments in those countries. The result is that all three nations continue to produce a steady stream of recruits for al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, while Yemen and Libya have grown increasingly violent and chaotic. The threat from Libya is particularly worrisome. The country is divided between two competing armies and governments, one secular and one Islamist, each with its own foreign sponsors. Their destructive rivalry has drastically reduced the oil exports on which Libya\u2019s 7 million people depend, while opening the space for jihadists. The faction headed by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, presumed killed in the airstrike, was affiliated with al-Qaeda, but it has caused less concern recently than an Islamic State affiliate that has gained control of one of Libya\u2019s coastal towns, Sirte, and has been advancing toward the major port of Misrata.

The first attacker targeted applicants gathered outside the home of a military commander, Brig. Gen. Abdullah al-Subaihi, killing at least 25, according to witnesses and Yemeni officials. \u201cThere were a group of applicants standing outside the gate of Subaihi\u2019s house carrying folders and filling out application forms when a terrorist stormed into the crowd blowing himself up and killing and injuring dozens,\u201d said Nabil Hassan Saleh, local journalist who arrived at the scene just minutes after the explosion. The second attack unfolded 10 minutes later outside an army base that also served as a recruitment center, killing at least 20, witnesses and officials said. The base is less than a mile from the commander\u2019s house. Witnesses said a bomb was planted in front of the gate, but other reports suggested that a suicide bomber detonated an car laden with explosives. \u201cWe heard the second explosion only minutes after the first explosion happened,\u201d said Bassam al-Qadi, 28, a human rights activist. \u201cThere were lots of bodies lying on the ground in both locations.\u201d Ambulances ferried the wounded to hospitals, he added. Many were in critical condition, hospital officials said. In a statement on social media, a local organization pledging allegiance to the Islamic State militant group asserted responsibility for both attacks. For nearly two years, the Arabian Peninsula nation has been torn apart by a civil war that pits a Saudi- and U.S.-backed government against Shiite rebels aligned with the forces of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The rebels and Saleh are in control of the capital, Sanaa, as well as large expanses of the north. Both sides are currently engaged in peace talks in Kuwait. The government largely controls Aden, but other parts of the south are under the domination of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist network\u2019s Yemen branch. Monday\u2019s blasts underscore the tenuous situation in southern Yemen, particularly in Aden, a strategic port on the Arabian Sea and a key global oil shipping lane. Only a few months ago, the government \u2014 backed by airstrikes from a Saudi-led coalition \u2014 seized the city from the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis. Since then, Aden has been devastated by suicide bombings and assassinations, largely targeting government security forces. Monday\u2019s attacks were the third in about a month. Last month, a car bomb targeted the house of the head of security in Aden, injuring one person. Another car bomb exploded three weeks ago, killing four and injuring at least eight in the Mansoura enclave of Aden.", "Title: Al-Qaeda assertion that it planned Paris attack draws some skepticism Content: U.S. intelligence has concluded that a video by al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Yemen asserting responsibility for last week\u2019s massacre at a Paris newspaper is genuine, but it has found no evidence so far to support the group\u2019s declaration that it directly planned, ordered and funded the attack, Obama administration officials said. Some officials and experts suggested that the video, released Wednesday by al- Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was an attempt by the group to enhance its militant profile and steal the spotlight from the Islamic State as the two compete for attention, recruits and financing. As U.S. and French intelligence agencies scramble for more information, U.S. officials emphasized that the fact that they have not yet found any direct communication between AQAP and the attackers in recent days, weeks or even years does not mean it doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cThe questions are legitimate,\u201d a U.S. intelligence official said. \u201cWas there some sort of call from AQAP, saying ISIL is eating our lunch and we need to do something?\u201d ISIL and ISIS are acronyms for the Islamic State, an offshoot that is at odds with the main al-Qaeda organization and has declared a caliphate in Syria and Iraq. \u201cOr was it just that these guys took a long time\u201d to carry out a plot hatched by AQAP in 2011, asked the official. That year, at least one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers \u2014 brothers Said and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi \u2014 is known to have visited Yemen, had contact with AQAP and returned with cash, according to officials. Even without evidence of a recent call or message, the intelligence official said, the Kouachi brothers were \u201cclearly inspired\u201d by AQAP. In addition to their travel to Yemen and declarations of AQAP fealty before they were killed by French security forces, there was a known \u201cdesire on behalf of AQAP to strike out against individuals that had insulted the prophet.\u201d The targeted satirical weekly has for years published cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad. \u201cIt\u2019s not inconceivable that these guys did come back\u201d from Yemen to France, \u201chad this plan for some time, and were just waiting for the right time to do it,\u201d said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.,) who as the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has been briefed on the investigation, said, \u201cIt may very well be that they got a list of targets\u201d in Yemen and were \u201cencouraged to attack the magazine.\u201d \u201cWhen they got back to France, they thought better of it for a while. That may account for the delay, rather than the strategic idea of a sleeper cell\u201d waiting for AQAP activation nearly four years later, Schiff said. In the 11-minute video, posted Wednesday online, an AQAP leader, Nasr al-Ansi, said his organization \u201cchose the target, laid the plan, financed the operation.\u201d He said that al-Qaeda\u2019s overall chief, Ayman al-Zawahiri, ordered the attack. Ansi, the Yemen affiliate\u2019s main ideological guide, went on to praise the Kouachis as \u201cheroes of Islam\u201d and said that after they received their assignment, \u201cthey promised and fulfilled.\u201d A total of 17 people were killed over three days of bloodshed that ended with twin police raids Friday that killed the two brothers and another gunman, Amedy Coulibaly, who had taken hostages at a kosher grocery in Paris. France\u2019s Justice Ministry said that at least 54 people have been detained as part of the terrorism investigation. Ansi referred to Coulibali as a \u201cbrother\u201d but did not claim credit for his actions. In a video released after his death, Coulibali said he was a follower of the Islamic State. Apparently referring to marches against the attacks attended by millions in Western capitals last weekend, Ansi said: \u201cLook how they have gathered, rallied and supported each other; strengthening their weaknesses and dressing their wounds. Those wounds have not healed and they won\u2019t, be it in Paris, New York or Washington, or in London or Spain, or in Palestine the legend of glory and pride,\u201d according to a translation from Arabic provided by the SITE Intelligence Group. Asked for additional information about the video, an individual who has claimed to represent AQAP and who has previously provided statements and other information to The Washington Post said he would no longer do so because of the paper\u2019s decision to publish the first post-attack cover of Charlie Hebdo, released this week. \u201cWe just deal with those who refuse to publish,\u201d he said in an encrypted communication on Wednesday. Officials and experts differed on the meaning of several aspects of the video claim. Some said the method of attack \u2014 men on foot with automatic rifles \u2014 did not fit with AQAP patterns. \u201cI remain skeptical that this was an AQAP-directed strike,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a fellow at the New America Foundation and the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. \u201cIt certainly does not fit the tactical hallmark of AQAP, which is the very creative use of small explosives.\u201d AQAP\u2019s most notable past plots have been foiled attempts to blow up civilian airliners. \u201cMy hypothesis is that when Said Kouachi visited Yemen, he was probably greeted warily by AQAP, which at that point was increasingly paranoid about potential infiltration by Western spies,\u201d Fishman said. \u201cSo they train him a bit, direct him toward relatively soft targets . . . and then send him on his way.\u201d On the other hand, AQAP could be \u201cfalling back on an old strategy\u201d after its failure for five years to \u201chave a spectacular attack,\u201d said Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security Studies. \u201cTheir desperation has increased appreciably over the past year, as ISIS has stolen their thunder.\u201d Some noted that an earlier AQAP video, released shortly after the attack, applauded the Kouachis but did not assert responsibility for their actions. With the new video coming a week later, \u201cI would place my bet on this being an after-the-fact claim in order to enhance the prominence and perceived effectiveness of the group, even if they\u2019re not actually behind the operation,\u201d said Paul Pillar of Georgetown, a former CIA specialist in the Middle East. One of the things intelligence analysts are looking at is \u201cwhy did it take so long,\u201d the intelligence official said. \u201cWere they caught off guard by the timing and had to quickly scramble and scrape together the video? Or were there some logistic concerns that delayed it? Right now, some are surmising that AQAP might have been caught a little flat-footed.\u201d Hugh Naylor in Beirut and Adam Goldman and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage directly mentions a suicide bombing attack on a military base in Yemen, killing 48 soldiers.

Gunmen in a Chinese speedboat drove Macario Forones, for instance, away from a favorite spot called Scarborough Shoal, and now his boat, the Marvin-1, sits useless in the grass and weeds above the high-tide line, and he sells someone else\u2019s fish from a stall in the local market. Efrim Forones now dives for clams in the bay, making about one-tenth of what he earned when he fished the sea. Viany Mula says he was set upon with a Chinese water cannon when he ventured out to the shoal in his boat, and now he makes deliveries around town on a motorbike, barely earning enough each day, as he puts it, to buy the rice he needs. \u201cI really want to fish the shoal,\u201d Mula said one recent day. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rich fishing ground. But that\u2019s not possible now.\u201d For generations, the South China Sea was a regional common. Fishing boats from all of the surrounding countries would roam its waters, pausing now and then to trade cigarettes or potatoes or gossip. But then Vietnam, followed by the Philippines, began staking claims to some of the islands, and now China is moving in, in a big way. Beijing is building up the outposts it has established, enlarging islands that it controls and claiming exclusive rights to fishing grounds. The smaller, poorer nations can\u2019t put up a real fight for the access to the sea that they long enjoyed. \u201cThat\u2019s not for us,\u201d Mula said. \u201cWe have nothing.\u201d But the Philippines does have the United States behind it, after a fashion. The Americans are making more visits here, and stepping up naval patrols and overflights \u2014 and in the process, the South China Sea dispute becomes something bigger than a contest for fish. It looks more and more like a geostrategic confrontation between the two great powers, China and the United States; that\u2019s certainly how the Chinese characterize it. The U.S. military has long been a source of anguish, self-doubt and defiance for the Philippines, a former U.S. colony. Many Filipinos are encouraged by recent U.S. attention to the maritime dispute, but they wonder whether the Americans give much thought to the Philippines and the people who are paying a price as the dispute deepens. A third of the residents of Masinloc have depended over the years on fishing for their livelihoods, said Mayor Desiree Edora. Scarborough Shoal, a half-day\u2019s sail from shore, was a refuge from storms, a gathering place for fishermen from all over and a home to abundant grouper and giant clams. Now, the Chinese have barred foreign boats. It is like being thrown out of your own house, she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t replicate what Scarborough Shoal can provide,\u201d she said. The Philippines took China to court \u2014 an international tribunal in The Hague \u2014 two years ago over competing claims in the sea. China refused to participate; a decision is expected next year, but it probably will be unenforceable. The Philippine move may have provoked the Chinese into trying to cement their claims by occupying and building up as many spots in the sea as they can, but officials in the Philippines say they had no choice after efforts to negotiate came to nothing. The governor of Zambales province, Hermogenes E. Ebdane Jr., said he wonders what China\u2019s ultimate goal is. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to war over fish,\u201d he said. His constituents, the fishermen, will have to find something else to do. But if this confrontation is about something bigger, Ebdane said, it\u2019s unclear what role the Philippines might have. There\u2019s a new defense agreement with the United States, but, he said, neither side seems to have thought through the implications for the murky weeks and months ahead. At the Defense College in Quezon City, on the outskirts of Manila, an entire wall in the lobby is given over to a painting that depicts the massacre of four dozen U.S. soldiers by Philippine insurgents at Balangiga in 1901. A diorama up a staircase shows Filipinos battling Spanish conquistadors and fighting against the Japanese in World War II \u2014 alongside Americans. The United States seized the Philippines from Spain in 1898 and held it until 1946. The U.S. military continued to keep permanent bases here until 1991. The legacy is a deep ambivalence toward the United States. But the U.S. Navy is the one force that is willing to challenge the Chinese and keep up regular patrols in the region. An agreement signed last year would allow the U.S. military a standing presence here, rotating forces onto Philippine bases. The agreement is held up by a lawsuit in the Philippine Supreme Court. Washington has stepped up visits and patrols, and it has made much of joint training exercises and the donation of used military equipment. \u201cThat is not to protect the Philippines but to protect their own turf,\u201d said Roilo Golez, a member of the country\u2019s House of Representatives. U.S. military aid, worth about $40 million a year, is nothing but a token, he said. The Philippine armed forces, in this nation of 100 million, remain in woeful shape. It is an article of faith that the government was caught napping when China began making its moves in the South China Sea. \u201cWe remain quite dependent on allied help, and that is not good,\u201d said Rafael Alunan III, former secretary of the interior. \u201cThe focus of the Philippine government has been on politics, politics, politics, at the expense of national security. China is taking advantage of our inertia and lack of assertiveness. We are presenting ourselves as unworthy before friend and foe.\u201d Walden Bello, founding director of a group called Focus on the Global South, said his country \u201cis right back to its role in the Cold War, when it played the part of handmaiden to the United States.\u201d But military officials here say they are unsure of the U.S. commitment if hostilities should break out. The United States and the Philippines have a mutual defense treaty pledging assistance if either is attacked, but Washington doesn\u2019t recognize any nation\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea, including the Philippines\u2019. Naval analysts in Washington say the U.S. response to conflict there would depend entirely on the circumstances. \u201cWe may have overestimated how the United States will come to the rescue,\u201d said Chito Santa Romana, an expert on China. \u201cWe may have underestimated Chinese resolve.\u201d The two biggest vessels in the Philippine navy are former U.S. Coast Guard cutters, retrofitted with deck guns, and of little use in standing up to the Chinese. The government, in any case, has no desire to provoke China into a military confrontation. That leaves the fishing fleet as the country\u2019s best means of maintaining a presence in the parts of the South China Sea that Beijing claims. Philippine \u2014 and Vietnamese \u2014 boats challenge the Chinese when and where they can, until the Chinese coast guard drives them off. It is waterborne civil disobedience. \u201cThese are small, subsistence fishermen,\u201d said Evan P. Garcia, undersecretary for policy in the Philippines\u2019 Department of Foreign Affairs. \u201cThey\u2019re not a threat to anybody. And it\u2019s not as if they just went there yesterday.\u201d The fish they\u2019re after may be the other big casualty of the dispute. The tensions over the years have kept anyone from getting good data on fish stocks or devising a conservation plan. Hundreds of millions of people live around the South China Sea and eat its fish. The Marine Stewardship Council, with an office in Singapore, says that the humpback wrasse and bluefin tuna populations are close to collapse. Edgardo Gomez, a marine biologist in Manila, said that the Chinese have wiped out the giant clams on Scarborough and that their construction work is destroying reefs that support the bottom levels of the sea\u2019s food chain. \u201cYou have tons and tons of marine life in and around those reefs that are now gone,\u201d he said. The hatch is being shut on a way of life. The United States and China are either pursuing strategic advantage or practicing destructive gamesmanship, depending on the perspective. Filipinos have to live with that \u2014 with the \u201codd detour,\u201d as Garcia put it, that brought them here. Viany Mula would trade his motorbike in the blink of an eye for a chance to return to sea. But that is not going to happen.

Big vessels \u2014 ships, really, with three or four decks, and heavy equipment \u2014 lay tied up close to the crowded town, looming over the low buildings along the bank. Then a workhorse of the sea \u2014 high-bowed, about 40 feet long, wheelhouse astern \u2014 slipped by. It was heading out for a week, or more likely a couple of weeks, on the open water.

The boat cleared the last bulkhead and then let loose with dozens of firecrackers that hung in strings over the sides.

We were in Tanmen, on the island of Hainan, at the northern approaches to the South China Sea, to talk with fishermen. We were not going from boat to boat looking for someone with tales to tell. Our local escorts had arranged a meeting on the paved walkway along the south bank of the river. A delegation of retired fishermen was there to receive us and tell us about their livelihoods. China and its neighbors are quarreling over the South China Sea, and fishermen play a role in that. Chinese coast guard boats have been driving Philippine and Vietnamese fishing boats away from reefs and fishing grounds that China now claims control of. We were here to get the Chinese water-level perspective. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Su Cheng Feng is 80, retired now for 11 years. At first, after the firecracker display died down, he was the most talkative. He said he didn't meet fishermen from other countries very often in the old days when he was out at sea, before the surrounding countries' territorial claims began to be taken seriously, because their boats were smaller than the Chinese boats, and, frankly, their skills weren't as high. The sea, he said, was China's traditional fishing ground. Chinese \"fishermen have been fishing in the South China Sea for many, many generations,\" he said. \"These are our own waters, just as natural as a farmer going to his field.\" We asked him about the past. What was it like before the Communists came to power in 1949, or even during the war, when he was a boy and his father was a fisherman? He didn't have much to say; nothing special, nobody talked about it. _[For some Filipinos, the South China Sea dispute is personal]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Wu Shujin, 79, Mai Yunxiu, 79, and Huang Qinghe, 82, listened in, added a word here and there. They had all been captains. They had fished for wrasse, grouper and mackerel. They dried their catch on board or sold it to a buyer's boat that would take it back to shore. They didn't get much help from the government. (Younger men standing nearby disputed that.) Then Lu Yuyong suddenly appeared. He's 51, still active on a boat. He took over the conversation. \"The life on a boat is very tough,\" he said. He brought out a pink plastic bag and unwrapped from it a traditional Chinese compass. It's one of the four great Chinese inventions, he said (along with gunpowder, paper-making and printing). Suddenly he was on his knees on the blacktop, unrolling a nautical chart of the sea. He was showing us how to use the compass on the chart, and having a little trouble, most likely because it had traditional markings on it and not the 360 degrees of a modern one. Su got down with him, and all the reporters and local hangers-on crowded around. Lu said he was glad the Chinese government is building up some of the islands in the sea; he has lost three family members in storms who had nowhere to go to and no one to help them. Permanent occupation on some of the islands could save lives, he said. But when fishermen from other countries dare to fish the South China Sea, he said, \"they're invading our waters.\" \"We could go all the way to Australia if we wanted to,\" he said. \"But we don't. That's not our ground. It's not about loving or not loving your country. It's about fishing your own waters.\" Chinese fisherman, he said, were the first to discover the islands of the South China Sea. \"And as opposed to other countries, we are civilized,\" he said, again mentioning the compass as one of the four great inventions. He rolled up the chart, then got out a piece of paper and drew his own map of the sea, which he labeled the \"Ancestor Sea.\" He talked about the annual celebrations in Tanmen for the Brotherhood of the 108 (also known as the 108 Stars of Destiny, or the Outlaws of the Marsh), demonic overlords from a 700-year-old novel who were banished, repented and were reborn as heroes. What upstart nation, he seemed to be asking, could lay claim to history here the way China can?", "Title: In Philippines, banana growers feel effect of South China Sea dispute Content: PANABO, Philippines \u2014 Dazzled by the opportunities offered by China\u2019s vast and increasingly prosperous populace, Renante Flores Bangoy, the owner of a small banana plantation here in the southern Philippines, decided three years ago to stop selling to multinational fruit corporations and stake his future on Chinese appetites. Through a local exporter, he started shipping all his fruit to China. Today, his estate on the tropical island of Mindanao is scattered with heaps of rotting bananas. For seven weeks now \u2014 ever since an aging U.S.-supplied Philippine warship squared off with Chinese vessels near a disputed shoal in the South China Sea \u2014 Bangoy has not been able to sell a single banana to China. He is a victim of sudden Chinese restrictions on banana imports from the Philippines that China says have been imposed for health reasons but that Bangoy and other growers view as retaliation for a recent flare-up in contested waters around Scarborough Shoal. \u201cThey just stopped buying,\u201d Bangoy said. \u201cIt is a big disaster.\u201d His plight points to the volatile nationalist passions that lie just beneath the placid surface of Asia\u2019s economic boom. It also underscores how quickly quarrels rooted in the distant past can disrupt the promise of a new era of shared prosperity and peace between rising China and its neighbors. Scarborough Shoal, a cluster of coral reefs and islets, lies more than 500 miles from the Chinese mainland and 140 miles off the northern coast of the Philippines, well within a 200-nautical-mile \u201cexclusive economic zone\u201d provided for by the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. But China \u2014 which claims most of the South China Sea, including portions also claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan \u2014 insists that the shoal has been part of its territory since at least the 13th century and points to old maps that mark it as Chinese. For a while, it looked as if the quarrel \u2014 which began in April when a Philippine warship confronted Chinese fishermen near the shoal and stirred a surge of nationalist fury in both countries \u2014 could tip into armed conflict between Asia\u2019s most potent military power and one of its puniest. China last year spent $129 billion on its armed forces, 58 times as much as the Philippines, according to data compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. The flagship of Manila\u2019s navy, the boat that intercepted the Chinese fishermen, is a 45-year-old hand-me-down from the U.S. Coast Guard. Manila does have one potent asset: a 1951 mutual defense treaty with Washington that the Philippines believes puts the world\u2019s most powerful navy on its side. The United States has a policy of not taking a position on territorial disputes in the South China Sea and has been ambiguous about what it would do in the event of a conflict. President Benigno Aquino III visited the State Department and the White House on Friday to press for clarity on U.S. intentions. Although rich in fish and long used as a shelter by Chinese and Philippine fishermen, Scarborough Shoal has no major economic or strategic value. But it has acquired great significance for both countries as a test case for issues of sovereignty that will help determine who gets to exploit potentially large reserves of natural gas and oil in other contested areas of the South China Sea. China and the Philippines have stepped back from the brink, curbing their angry rhetoric and halting a buildup of ships near the shoal, which the Chinese call Huangyan Island and the Filipinos know as Panatag Shoal. But bananas are the Philippines\u2019s second-biggest agricultural export, and for growers more than 700 miles from the disputed area, the damage is done. \u201cWe are collateral damage,\u201d said Stephen Antig, executive director of the Pilipino Banana Growers and Exporters Association, a group based in Mindanao\u2019s Davao City, the center of the Philippine banana business. He estimates that as many as 200,000 people in the region will lose their livelihood if China continues to curb imports. Antig had been due to visit China soon to talk to buyers but is going instead to Iran and several Arab countries in search of substitute markets. The tourism industry, meanwhile, has been hammered by a rash of abrupt cancellations of vacation bookings from China after a travel advisory issued by Beijing. Aquino, speaking Friday to Washington Post editors and reporters, said: \u201cThat advisory, we think, was very unfounded. They were portraying us as being anti-Chinese.\u2019\u2019 China denies mixing politics and business, and it regularly condemns boycotts announced by others. But Beijing has a clear record of quietly using trade to punish countries it quarrels with. When the Oslo-based Nobel Peace Prize committee announced in late 2010 that it would honor jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, Beijing reacted with fury. Norwegian exports of fresh and frozen salmon to China collapsed, falling by 59 percent last year. Imports of the fish from elsewhere soared. There has been no formal Chinese order restricting imports from Norway, only stringent new food-safety regulations that have mysteriously targeted Norwegian fish. A 2010 study by two scholars at Germany\u2019s Gottingen University found a direct correlation between China\u2019s foreign policy agenda and trade flows. It noted that China\u2019s authoritarian political system and the large role played by the state in its economy \u201cgives leeway for the utilization of trade flows as a foreign policy tool.\u201d Analyzing data between 1991 and 2008 from 159 trading partners of China, the study found that countries whose leaders met with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader, suffered a swift decline of 8.1 percent to 16.9 percent in exports to China. It said that the phenomenon began after China\u2019s current leader, Hu Jintao, took charge of the ruling Communist Party in 2002, a period that has coincided with a surge in Chinese economic and military power. Beijing reviles the Buddhist monk, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, as a subversive \u201csplittist\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d and demands that foreign governments not receive him. Bangoy, the banana grower in Panabo, has no doubt that his China woes are connected to the Scarborough Shoal fracas. The Philippines, he noted, \u201chas been selling bananas to China for more than 10 years without problems, so why did this suddenly happen now?\u201d Unable to sell his fruit because neither local exporters nor Chinese buyers want to risk having their shipments held up for weeks and then rejected by customs inspectors, he has shut down his packing facilities and is praying that the storm will soon pass. His workers still chop bunches of bananas but only because leaving them unharvested would cause disease. \u201cAll this is worthless,\u201d he said, pointing to piles of decaying fruit scattered throughout his plantation. \u201cWe have to look for alternatives,\u201d he said. Otherwise, \u201cthis whole industry will die.\u201d Before the crisis, China took about a quarter of all bananas exported by the Philippines. This is less than the amount taken by Japan, but China stirred far more excitement among Philippine growers because its appetite just kept growing. Chinese imports of Philippine bananas rose by 27 percent last year and had been expected to increase by up to 40 percent this year, said Antig of the growers association. Today, with China-bound refrigerated containers piling up at the Davao City port, the town has \u201cbeen flooded with free bananas,\u201d said the mayor, Sara Duterte. Traders have donated \u201cboxes and boxes of bananas,\u201d she said, prompting city hall to set up a distribution network to deliver free fruit to schools, orphanages and government offices. The government in Manila, eager to end a tug of war with China that it has little chance of winning, has not publicly disputed Beijing\u2019s assertion that the collapse of banana exports to China is due to health concerns, not politics. Speaking to The Post on Friday, Aquino said there was \u201csome basis\u2019\u2019 to believe that China is acting at least partly out of legitimate contamination concerns. Asked about China\u2019s approach to his country, Aquino expressed puzzlement: \u201cWe\u2019re still analyzing, frankly, what their intentions are. There are some who are very nationalistic, there are some who are very outward looking.\u2019\u2019 China sent an initial warning to the Philippines about the health of its bananas in March, several weeks before the start of the South China Sea standoff. But the warning targeted fruit from a single Japanese conglomerate operating in Mindanao and led to no general curbs on imports. In early May, however, after the Philippine navy confronted Chinese fishing boats near Scarborough Shoal, China\u2019s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine sharply escalated the health issue, saying in a letter to the Philippine Department of Agriculture that it had found 104 types of \u201charmful organisms\u201d in bananas and other fruit sent from the Philippines. Antig said he thinks \u201cthey just went on the Internet and found a list of all the diseases that attack bananas.\u201d The real reason for China\u2019s sudden vigilance is not disease but Scarborough Shoal, he said, adding, \u201cThey know where to hit us.\u201d Bananas are the mainstay of the economy in the region around Davao City, an area that in the 1980s slipped into chaos as Marxist rebels of the New People\u2019s Army put down deep roots in impoverished villages and spread terror in the city with a campaign of assassinations. Bangoy, the banana grower in Panabo, a district just north of Davao City, said that hamlets around his plantation once swarmed with NPA guerrillas but that, thanks to banana-led economic growth, the insurgents have now lost much of their appeal. \u201cThey will be back,\u201d he said, if Chinese import restrictions remain in force and push banana growers into bankruptcy. In other parts of Mindanao, the Philippine military, with help from U.S. troops, is fighting to contain an insurgency by Muslim militants. Local officials in Panabo are being deluged with requests for assistance from plantation workers laid off because of the squeeze on exports to China. \u201cLaborers are crying for an income and are all asking us for help,\u201d said Henry Esparagola, the town\u2019s administrator. Left-wing activists accuse banana growers of exaggerating their China woes to deflect pressure for higher wages and an end to restrictions on trade union organization. But, in a sign of how the Scarborough Shoal dispute has united the country\u2019s feuding political groups, they, too, insist that the territory belongs to the Philippines and that Communist Party-ruled China must back off. \u201cHow can it claim to be socialist when it oppresses a poor, marginalized sovereign country like the Philippines?\u201d asked Joel Virador, vice chairman of the May 1st Labor Movement, a leftist union. Duterte, the mayor, said that in the past Scarborough Shoal \u201cjust wasn\u2019t an issue at all\u201d for most locals. She had never even heard of it until the recent flare-up made headlines, she said. The mayor still thinks the Philippines can gain in the long run from China\u2019s rise and has enrolled her 4-year-old daughter in a local Chinese-language school. \u201cYou cannot ignore China,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a very big market.\u201d But the mayor does have one big worry: \u201cThey know their power and how to use it.\u201d **More world news coverage:** \\- Socialists, allies take lead in French parliamentary elections \\- In Spain\u2019s bailout request, Greece\u2019s crisis played key role \\- Official: Egypt\u2019s Mubarak slipping in and out of consciousness \\- Read more headlines from around the world", "Title: In Asia, a wave of escalating territorial disputes Content: TOKYO \u2014 The disputed islands and islets in Asia are, on the whole, an unimpressive bunch. Most are rocky, windswept outcroppings far from any mainland. One has a lighthouse but no people. But these tiny territories, sweeping from southeast to northeast Asia, are fiercely contested among countries that are buoyed by nationalism and by a growing thirst for the natural resources off their shores. At a time when the United States has promised to play a greater role in Asia, some security experts say the territories represent the region\u2019s greatest potential flash point aside from North Korea. The territorial disputes involve nearly a dozen countries in at least three major seas, and they have set off a chaotic crisscross of conflict in some of the world\u2019s most trafficked shipping lanes. The disputes are not all connected, but analysts say that several of Asia\u2019s key countries \u2014 China, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines \u2014 have in recent months followed a similar pattern, turning old historical squabbles into national priorities, escalating tensions and raising the chances of a small-scale armed conflict. The countries are driven to claim these far-flung offshore territories in part because of their growing need for the oil and gas reserves in the waters around them. Japan fears prolonged energy shortages as it turns from nuclear power, and China, already responsible for one-fifth of the world\u2019s energy consumption, is racing to increase its share as its economy modernizes. \u201cEnergy resources are increasingly a critical issue here,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, director of international security at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. \u201cParticularly from a Chinese and Japanese point of view, there\u2019s a new sense of the need for energy security. None of these countries want to categorically give up claims to territory where there could be large hydrocarbon deposits.\u201d The countries are also driven by fierce, though sometimes small, nationalist movements in their own back yards. The nationalism has been intensified by social media, some analysts say, particularly in China, where hundreds of millions of Internet users can share their opinions and public sentiment is harder than ever to ignore. Countries such as South Korea and China are set for leadership changes this year, making government officials wary of backing off claims and appearing weak. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over history countries go to war over territory \u2014 area that seems to be meaningless, but it\u2019s the soil of the country,\u201d said Bruce Klingner, a senior researcher and a Northeast Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cEven if it would appear illogical for countries to risk conflagration over rocks. . . that is what is occurring.\u201d The most notable current disputes involve Japan and South Korea, China and Japan, and China and a host of southeast Asian countries, most vocally the Philippines and Vietnam. China, with its increased military spending and naval might, is often pinpointed by foreign leaders as the regional bully, pushing its boundaries and intimidating smaller neighbors. But other countries have responded with shows of force of their own. Several southeast Asian countries have tightened alliances with Washington and conducted joint military drills. Japan realigned its Self-Defense Forces with the aim to better defend disputed waters. In July, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III asked his country\u2019s congress to approve a massive military upgrade involving new planes and combat helicopters that could be used to defend contested areas in the South China Sea. \u201cIf someone enters your yard and told you he owns it, will you allow that?\u201d Aquino said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to give away what is rightfully ours.\u201d Managing the territorial disputes has become a fraught issue for Asian leaders. One much-criticized move came Friday when South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, in an apparent ploy to boost his low support ratings, traveled by helicopter for a 70-minute visit to the Dokdo (or Takeshima) islets, also claimed by Japan. \u201cDokdo is genuinely our territory,\u201d Lee said on the island, where he laid flowers in front of a monument commemorating Koreans who died defending the territory. \u201cWhy did he visit there at a time when we need to consider issues from a broad viewpoint?\u201d Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said soon after. \u201cIt is extremely regrettable.\u201d Security experts say the Japan-South Korea dispute has little chance of escalating into violence, because the two countries \u2014 Washington\u2019s closest allies in Asia \u2014 are mostly cooperative economic partners, despite lingering animosities from Japan\u2019s 35-year occupation. But other areas in the region are more troubling, particularly those claimed by China. A recent report from the Brussels-based International Crisis Group described how China is patrolling the sea with \u201cnine dragons,\u201d a tangle of conflicting government agencies, many of them trying to increase their power and budget. The People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy tends to take a background role in sea disputes, the report said, allowing a greater role for civilian law enforcement or paramilitary agencies. An increasing number of rogue Chinese fishing vessels are also operating in contested areas, as seen in an April standoff between Beijing and Manila that started when Chinese fishermen were caught poaching near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. Eventually, China won the standoff and the fishermen made off with their catch. Washington has tried to stay neutral in the various disputes but has emphasized the importance of freedom of navigation. During a June meeting with Aquino, President Obama urged Asian countries to settle on a \u201cstrong set of international norms and rules governing maritime disputes in the region.\u201d Regional leaders, though, have failed to agree on any set of rules, and at a July foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Cambodia, conflicts about the South China Sea prompted the leaders to walk away without even a basic communique. A recent Pentagon-commissioned proposal by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, pointed out that \u201cstakes are growing\u201d in the region because of China\u2019s aggressive maritime activities. The think tank\u2019s proposal on U.S. strategy in Asia raised the possibility of basing a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier on the Australian coast, allowing the U.S. a second carrier strike group in the region. But Australia\u2019s defense minister quickly rejected the idea, and analysts in Australia suggested the country was unwilling to antagonize China, its largest trading partner. **More world news coverage:** \\- Foes hit France\u2019s Hollande over Syria \\- S.

Kerry and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi squared off in talks Saturday over China asserting sovereignty on man-made islands it is creating near heavily trafficked sea lanes in the South China Sea. After a lengthy meeting the two had after Kerry arrived in Beijing, Kerry told reporters he had stressed to Wang that the region needs \u201csmart diplomacy\u201d and \u201cnot outposts and military strips\u201d like those Washington suspects Beijing wants to establish on islands it is building from sand dredged from the sea bottom. The United States thinks China is trying to \u201cbuild sovereignty.\u201d \u201cI urged China, through Foreign Minister Wang, to take actions that will join with everybody to help reduce tensions and increase the prospect of a diplomatic solution,\u201d Kerry told reporters in a news conference. Wang reiterated the Chinese position that \u201cChina\u2019s development of some of the islands and reefs . . . falls fully within the scope of China\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d Amid reports that the Pentagon is considering sending ships and planes to expand its patrols near the new islands, Wang said China would act to protect its interests. \u201cWe reaffirm the determination of the Chinese side to safeguard our own sovereignty and territorial integrity is as firm as a rock, and it is unshakable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the request from our people on their government, as well as a legitimate right of ours.\u201d Wang stressed that China is committed to international freedom of navigation that the United States fears may be in jeopardy and to negotiating to settle claims five other nations have to the disputed waters. As for its differences with the United States, Wang added, \u201cIt is okay to have differences, as long as we can avoid misunderstanding, and even more importantly, avoid miscalculation.\u201d China\u2019s state-run media has been more blunt about U.S. criticism of the islands. It has portrayed China\u2019s construction of facilities in the South China Sea as part of Beijing\u2019s obligation as the major power in the region to safeguard maritime safety. China has insisted it is primarily interested in building facilities so it can better protect ships from piracy and fishermen during typhoon season, though it has acknowledged they would have some military use as well. In an editorial Thursday, the state-run Global Times said the U.S. threat to expand its patrols near the new islands was a provocation that could turn the South China Sea into \u201ca powder keg.\u201d \u201cIt should keep in mind that China is a major power with nuclear weapons, and there is no way that U.S. forces can take reckless actions in the South China Sea,\u201d it said, and added, \u201cBesides, the long-term chaos will eventually deprive the U.S. of its patronage to other countries in the region, which will only be victimized by the war.\u201d The top item on Kerry\u2019s agenda during his two-day visit to Beijing is laying the groundwork for a planned state visit by President Xi Jinping this fall. But his trip coincides with a series of sharp verbal salvos over the South China Sea, which half the merchant ships in the world traverse every year. The tensions stem from a huge land reclamation project that has China aggressively creating islands atop rocks, atolls and submerged reefs. Some of the new islands are large enough to support airstrips and military facilities, and the United States is worried that China, by extending its territorial claims, will also claim exclusive economic zones on the reclaimed islands in areas that are contested by five other nations. \u201cUltimately, no matter how much sand China piles on top of a submerged reef or shoal, it is not affecting its territorial claim,\u201d said a senior State Department official last week, speaking on the condition of anonymity under agency rules. \u201cYou can\u2019t build sovereignty.\u201d The official said that in his talks with top Chinese officials, including Xi, Kerry would stress the \u201cvery negative consequences\u201d of China\u2019s assertiveness in the disputed waters on its image, on its relationship with its smaller neighbors that also claim rights in the area where China is building \u201cand potentially on the U.S.-China relationship.\u201d That relationship already shows signs of strain since reports emerged last week that the Pentagon was considering expanding patrols in the South China Sea, venturing within a 12-nautical-mile radius of the islands rising from the sea. Kerry also planned to discuss issues on which Beijing and Washington can cooperate, including climate change and the Iran nuclear talks. As a member of the U.N. Security Council, China is one of the five countries that are negotiating partners with the United States as it seeks a deal that would curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program, although it has not been actively involved in talks. Kerry was to meet Sunday morning with Xi before departing for South Korea. **Read more:** How the South China Sea could help Beijing level the nuclear playing field Beijing's power play in the South China Sea may be killing coral reefs"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the role of Chinese fishermen in the South China Sea dispute, which aligns with the query.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most detailed account of Chinese fishermen's activities and their perspective on the dispute.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Chinese coast guard boats have been driving Philippine and Vietnamese fishing boats away from reefs and fishing grounds that China now claims control of."}, {"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the impact of the South China Sea dispute on Filipino fishermen, indirectly implying the role of Chinese fishermen.", "listwise_reason": "While it doesn't focus on Chinese fishermen, it provides valuable context about the dispute's impact on fishing activities in the region.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Gunmen in a Chinese speedboat drove Macario Forones, for instance, away from a favorite spot called Scarborough Shoal."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses China's territorial claims in the South China Sea, which indirectly relates to the role of Chinese fishermen.", "listwise_reason": "Although it doesn't directly discuss Chinese fishermen, it provides important context about the geopolitical tensions in the region.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Secretary of State John F.

New documents show otherwise. Content: A contractor for the controversial classifieds website Backpage.com has been aggressively soliciting and creating sex-related ads, despite Backpage\u2019s repeated insistence that it had no role in the content of ads posted on its site, according to a trove of newly discovered documents. The documents show that Backpage hired a company in the Philippines to lure advertisers \u2014 and customers seeking sex \u2014 from sites run by its competitors. The spreadsheets, emails, audio files and employee manuals were revealed in an unrelated legal dispute and provided to The Washington Post. Workers in the Philippine call center scoured the Internet for newly listed sex ads, then contacted the people who posted them and offered a free ad on Backpage.com, the documents show. The contractor\u2019s workers even created each new ad so it could be activated with one click. Workers also created phony sex ads, offering to \u201cLet a young babe show you the way\u201d or \u201cLittle angel seeks daddy,\u201d adding photos of barely clad women and explicit sex patter, the documents show. The workers posted the ads on competitors\u2019 websites. Then, when a potential customer expressed interest, an email directed that person to Backpage.com, where they would find authentic ads, spreadsheets used to track the process show.

Backpage argues it is a passive carrier of \u201cthird-party content\u201d and has no control of sex-related ads posted by pimps, prostitutes and even organized trafficking rings. The company contends it removes clearly illegal ads and refers violators to the police. The discovery could be a turning point in the years-long campaign by anti- human trafficking groups, and Congress, to persuade Backpage to stop hosting prostitution ads, which many teenage girls have claimed were used to sell them for sexual exploitation. Lawsuits and criminal prosecutions of Backpage in the United States have nearly all failed because Backpage cites in its defense the federal Communications Decency Act, which grants immunity to websites that merely host or screen content posted by others. An investigation by a Senate subcommittee revealed earlier this year found that Backpage was editing ads to remove language indicating underage girls were available, rather than removing the ads. \u201cBackpage has been righteously indignant throughout our investigation,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a subcommittee member, \u201cabout how we were infringing on their constitutional rights, because they were a mere passthrough.\u201d She noted, however, that Backpage was not only changing ads but also was also guiding posters in how to conceal their true intentions. \u201cBut that\u2019s nothing compared to this\u201d new information, McCaskill said after The Post described the data. \u201cThis is about as far from passive as you can get. This is soliciting. This is, really, trickery. . . . So I hope this opens the floodgates of liability for Backpage. Nobody deserves it more.\u201d The Post provided parts of the seized data to Backpage general counsel Liz McDougall for her review. She declined to comment after seeing it. Backpage has frequently noted that it cooperates with and has been thanked by numerous law enforcement agencies for providing investigators with connections to pimps and other criminals. McDougall has said that Backpage acts as \u201cthe sheriff of the Internet\u201d and that sex ads would be dispersed among sites in other countries if Backpage stopped posting them. Backpage, based in Dallas, is an online classified ad service similar to Craigslist, with sites operating in at least 97 countries and 943 locations, enabling users to buy and sell cars, audio equipment, concert tickets \u2014 and \u201cadult services,\u201d seemingly a smorgasbord of barely disguised prostitution ads. Though Backpage announced in January it was discontinuing its \u201cadult services\u201d page, the same types of ads still appear under the \u201cdating\u201d category. Backpage has said that content is protected by the First Amendment, a view which has been endorsed by the courts. Most ads on Backpage are free. But ads in the \u201cdating\u201d section cost at least $3, and they cost more for posting in more than one city or for periodically moving the ad to the top of the list. The Senate report said that more than 93 percent of Backpage\u2019s ad revenue in 2011 came from its adult section, leading to $135 million in gross revenue in 2014, with projected revenue of nearly $250 million by 2019. Among the sex ads posted on Backpage.com are those for underage boys and girls, authorities and advocacy groups say. The National Association of Attorneys General has described Backpage as a \u201chub\u201d of human trafficking, which involves children or adults who are forced or coerced into prostitution. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that 73 percent of the 10,000 child sex trafficking reports it receives from the public each year involve ads on Backpage. \u201cThis is the commercialization of this crime against children,\u201d said Yiota Souras, the center\u2019s general counsel. \u201cAnd it\u2019s what businesses do \u2014 they grow internationally; they have marketing plans to beat the competition and offer incentives to get more clients; they seek legal protections for their business interests. This is a traditional business model, but here the transaction too often is selling children for sex online.\u201d In January, Backpage\u2019s top officials appeared before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Chief executive Carl Ferrer, co-founders Michael Lacey and James Larkin and general counsel McDougall all invoked their Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate themselves and declined to answer any questions. Ferrer, Lacey and Larkin are facing criminal charges in California for pimping and money laundering, though a court there threw out similar pimping charges last year. And among eight civil suits filed against Backpage this year is a wrongful-death action in Chicago by the mother of 16-year-old Desiree Robinson, who was slain in December after repeatedly being sold for sex on Backpage. \u201cEvery single day, we\u2019re learning something new,\u201d said Yvonne Ambrose, Desiree\u2019s mother. \u201cNot just what\u2019s going on with Desiree, but what\u2019s happening with Backpage, what they\u2019re doing on this site. Everybody knows they\u2019re doing it, and they\u2019re not being held accountable.\u201d Backpage has not responded to the suit, which was filed in May. In late June, federal agents arrested the man who allegedly had been posting Backpage ads for Desiree, which described her as \u201cNicki,\u201d who was \u201cnew in town\u201d and \u201clooking for upscale Gentlemen to have a great time with.\u201d The FBI alleged that Joseph Hazley, 33, would drive her to appointments for \u201ccommercial sex\u201d and collected some or all of the money she was paid. \u201cI\u2019m in a situation where I\u2019m being pimped,\u201d Desiree wrote on Facebook days before her death. \u201cHe won\u2019t let me leave.\u201d Hazley was charged in federal court with sex trafficking of a minor. Hazley\u2019s lawyer, Michael Schmiege, said in an interview that Hazley didn\u2019t know that Desiree was a minor and had no role in her killing. The materials seized in December from the Backpage contractor, Avion BPO, a busy phone and online operation in Laoag City, Philippines, show workers focused on adding and promoting sexual ads. One manual apparently created for Avion employees provides step-by-step instruction on how to find ads on other websites and copy them (\u201cyou can now transfer the details of your advertisement from the other Classified Site to Backpage,\u201d the manual states). The manuals suggest that other types of ads, such as for jobs, are also targeted, but the spreadsheets seized from Avion focus largely on sex ads. Then, after creating a fake user profile on the other classifieds site, the worker fishes for the advertiser\u2019s email or phone number. Various translations of \u201cCan you meet today?,\u201d \u201cNice Pictures!,\u201d \u201cWant to have fun?\u201d and other messages are then sent in the appropriate language to the advertiser. When the advertiser responds to the message, the workers in the Philippines either call or email with an offer to post their ad on Backpage free of charge, with the ad already created and ready to go. In one email, a person with a Backpage.com email address reminded Avion workers to search its competitors\u2019 sites for the latest postings, noting that dozens can be added each day. In the email, the Backpage employee included a list of ads from Vivastreet, a similar classified ad website in Europe and Australia, including one titled \u201cHot and Sexy and Ready for You\u201d and another called \u201cSweet Christine New in North harrow - all service for you.\u201d The manuals also discuss creating and posting false ads on other sites. When potential customers respond, Avion workers responded with emails saying the poster had moved to Backpage. \u201cHey baby, Sorry i missed your email. I got locked out of my Vivastreet account,\u201d one email said, \u201cand just finally got them to open it back up for me . . . I have one on back page now too.\u201d A link to Backpage is included, though the phony ad is not posted. Instead, the redirected customer is now presented with Backpage\u2019s actual advertisers. There are also numerous spreadsheets that track the creation of fake profiles and fake ads on other sites and the responses to those ads, as well as a list of advertisers on other sites and their contact information. Backpage says it uses an automated program to strip objectionable words from ads, such as \u201clolita\u201d and \u201cteenage\u201d and \u201crape,\u201d the Senate subcommittee report found, while leaving the rest of the ad online. But Backpage also uses Avion to manually review ads, and the new documents show how Backpage strives to keep ads from being deleted. \u201cI was reviewing deleted ads,\u201d one Backpage employee wrote to Avion. \u201cHere are a few removals that I restored. Some only needed pics removed,\u201d meaning that Backpage republished ads that Avion agents had taken down. The discovery of the documents came about accidentally, as part of a lawsuit in Kansas City, Mo. A D.C.-based commercial real estate data firm, CoStar, claimed last year that a competing firm in suburban Kansas City, Xceligent, was delving into the CoStar website and stealing its data. Xceligent has denied the allegations in the pending case. CoStar said it believed that the actual alleged data theft was being committed by a contractor for Xceligent \u2014 Avion. In December, CoStar obtained a civil search order in the Philippines. CoStar executives say they assembled an 85-person team of Filipino officials, IT experts, lawyers and private security forces and raided Avion\u2019s three-building complex in Laoag City, seizing 35 terabytes of information comprising some 6.5 million files. All of Avion\u2019s computers were then bubble-wrapped and flown back to the United States to aid CoStar in its case. While analyzing the data about Xceligent, CoStar discovered huge amounts of Backpage data on the same computers. CoStar founder Andrew Florance started going through the files. \u201cThe word \u2018Backpage\u2019 was just all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found organizational charts showing Avion\u2019s two big clients are Xceligent and Backpage. So we googled \u2018Backpage.\u2019 \u201d CoStar turned over the Backpage data to the FBI. The FBI declined to comment on whether it is investigating. Xceligent officials said in a statement that \u201cwe do not own or control Avion\u2019s business, we are not affiliated with Backpage, and we have no way of knowing about Avion\u2019s purported work for Backpage.\u201d Avion chief executive Von Nagasangan and chief operating officer Joy Nagasangan did not respond to requests for comment. After Ambrose sued Backpage in Chicago over the death of her daughter, her lawyers subpoenaed the Backpage data from CoStar for their civil case. Ambrose\u2019s lawyers at Romanucci & Blandin then turned the data over to The Post. The documents include audio files of calls between Avion employees and people who have posted ads on other sites, apparently recorded for company purposes. \u201cHey Crystal,\u201d an Avion employee said in one recorded call. \u201cI just saw your ad you posted on Escorts South Africa and we would like to invite you to repost your ad for free at Backpage. All we need is your email address.\u201d Crystal declined, saying she had been warned about such inquiries, \u201cand don\u2019t ever call me again.\u201d But others agreed to the prospect of a free Backpage ad and provided their email addresses. Employee manuals and tracking spreadsheets show that in the follow-up email from Avion, a link is provided where the new advertiser can see what their ad will look like \u2014 Avion has already created it, having lifted the material from the original site, and it\u2019s ready to go with just one click. Invoices and call sheets indicate Backpage was pushing Avion to get as many new listings as possible, generating ads from competing sites including Locanto in Europe, Australia and South America, Eurogirlsescort.com, Privategirls.com, PrivateRomania, Gumtree and many others. Virtually every attempt by sex victims or law enforcement to stop Backpage from facilitating such action has been shut down by Backpage\u2019s reliance on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, written in 1996 during the Internet\u2019s infancy. The law protects website operators from being held liable for content posted by their users. In recent federal appeals court rulings in both Chicago and Boston, courts have sided with Backpage, as they have in numerous lower courts for years. \u201cUsers provide all the content for ads they post,\u201d Backpage lawyers wrote in the Boston case. \u201cThe website does not dictate or require any content.\u201d The lawyers went further: \u201cThe law under Section 230 is clear that if an online provider has _actual_ knowledge of illegal content posted on its site, the provider is immune even if it fails or refuses to delete the content.\u201d Congress is gearing up to try to amend Section 230, though it faces a powerful opponent in First Amendment proponents and websites wary of government regulation. Regardless of the law, Backpage has always claimed it has made \u201cextensive efforts to prevent, screen and block improper ads from users,\u201d as it wrote in one filing in federal court in Washington in 2015. \u201cBackpage.com does not create or develop any of the advertising or discussion content,\u201d it wrote in one presentation provided to Senate investigators, \u201cbut simply provides a forum for the online publication of users\u2019 content.\u201d Various authorities have tried different approaches to try to shut down Backpage\u2019s sex ads. In Chicago, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart issued a cease- and-desist order to Visa and MasterCard, telling them to stop accepting payment for Backpage. Backpage sued the sheriff and won. In Boston, three women who were sold on Backpage sued the site\u2019s owners, but a federal appeals court, with a panel featuring former Supreme Court Justice David Souter, ruled that the Communications Decency Act shielded Backpage from liability. But in Washington state, the state Supreme Court ruled that a suit by three victims of sex trafficking could proceed. Nacole S., whose daughter was trafficked on Backpage at the age of 15 for more than three months, was amazed by the new revelations. The Post is withholding her last name to conceal her daughter\u2019s identity. \u201cI find it morally disgusting,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only are they exploiting young women that are clearly vulnerable, but they\u2019re furthering their exploitation by putting them on another website. It just shows the lack of morality of this company, how little they care about the victims. Which child is going to be enough to make this end?\u201d _This article has been updated to reflect additional comment from Xceligent. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the ad offering \u201cfresh young sweet simple girl\u201d as a phony created by Avion workers to lure business. It was an authentic ad posted on a competitor\u2019s site, the documents show, and Avion sought to persuade the advertiser to post it on Backpage.com._ Read more: Hunting for sex-traffickers abroad \u2014 by posing as johns What life inside the Islamic State looks like for recruits Dirt-bike dealers battling brazen \u2018wheelie boys\u2019 in thefts", "Title: Backpage.com shuts down adult services ads after relentless pressure from authorities Content: Fighting accusations from members of Congress that it facilitated child sex trafficking, the classified advertising site Backpage.com abruptly closed its adult advertising section in the United States on Monday, saying years of government pressure left it no choice but to shutter its most popular and lucrative feature. The decision came shortly after a Senate panel released a report alleging Backpage concealed criminal activity by removing words from ads that would have exposed child sex trafficking and prostitution. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is scheduled to hold a hearing on the report Tuesday morning. Backpage\u2019s founders and executives will appear in the hearing but do not plan to testify, according to their attorneys. Backpage said in a statement that scrutiny of the site by government officials has made it too costly to keep operating the adult section. The company rejected the subcommittee\u2019s findings, saying the decision was the result of \u201cunconstitutional government censorship.\u201d \u201cFor years, the legal system protecting freedom of speech prevailed,\u201d Backpage said, \u201cbut new government tactics, including pressuring credit card companies to cease doing business with Backpage, have left the company with no other choice but to remove the content in the United States.\u201d Backpage has been the target of multiple lawsuits and investigations in recent years focusing on its adult ads, and its founders and executives are currently fighting money-laundering and pimping charges in California. The federal Communications Decency Act provides immunity to website operators that publish third-party content online, but multiple lawsuits have argued that the 1996 law does not protect Backpage because the site contributes to illegal activity \u2014 claims Backpage has vigorously denied. The Senate subcommittee raised similar concerns Monday. Its report alleged that Backpage knowingly hid child sex trafficking and prostitution by deleting incriminating terms from its ads before publication. The report found that the company used a feature that automatically scrubbed words such as \u201cteenage,\u201d \u201crape\u201d and \u201cyoung\u201d from some ads, while manually removing terms from others. The subcommittee also alleged that Backpage founders James Larkin and Michael Lacey still own financial stakes in the company, despite claiming that they sold their shares roughly two years ago. The panel has been investigating Backpage since June 2015. Initially, the company refused to turn over subpoenaed documents, but a federal court ordered the company to comply with the probe last summer. Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who spearheaded the investigation, said Backpage\u2019s decision to close the adult section showed that it was \u201ccomplicit\u201d in online sex trafficking. In a separate statement, Larkin and Lacey cited Backpage\u2019s list of legal battles, saying courts in multiple states have sided with the site in litigation over its adult ads. \u201cToday, the censors have prevailed. We get it,\u201d Larkin and Lacey said in a statement. \u201cBut the shut-down of Backpage\u2019s adult classified advertising is an assault on the First Amendment. We maintain hope for a more robust and unbowed Internet in the future.\u201d Backpage contends that its adult section has become a resource for law enforcement agencies and says the closing of its adult section will not reduce human trafficking. According to Backpage attorneys, local and federal authorities around the country have turned to the site for help tracking down people who have \u201cimpermissibly sought to use the internet as a platform to commit abhorrent crimes.\u201d The site has long collaborated with law enforcement officers, the attorneys said, and has donated to Children of the Night, an organization whose mission is to rescue children from prostitution. Children of the Night Founder and President Lois Lee called the site a \u201ccritical investigative tool\u201d that has helped authorities arrest pimps and recover missing children. \u201cThe ability to search for and track potentially exploited children on a website and have the website bend over backwards to help and cooperate with police the way Backpage did was totally unique,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cIt not only made law enforcement\u2019s job easier, it made them much more effective at rescuing kids and convicting pimps.\u201d", "Title: Members of Congress press Sessions to investigate sexual ads at Backpage.com Content: Five members of Congress who head anti-human-trafficking groups called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to launch a criminal investigation of Backpage.com after a trove of documents revealed that the website hired a company in the Philippines to lure advertisers and customers seeking sex. Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who lead a subcommittee that has investigated Backpage since 2015, along with Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) and Reps. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) and Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) demanded on Thursday that the Justice Department examine the classifieds site after information about the documents was reported by The Washington Post this week. Wagner and Maloney, co-chairs of a House task force on human trafficking, accused Backpage of \u201cknowingly advertising and financially benefiting from participation in sex trafficking.\u201d \u201cBackpage.com has long argued that it is a mere third-party platform with no responsibility for the sex trafficking ads that are posted on its website,\u201d the congresswomen wrote in a letter to Sessions. \u201cThis is an utter lie.\u201d The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Portman, found in January that Backpage was removing offensive terms from its sex ads but allowing the ads, some with possible child-trafficking content, to remain posted. The committee wrote to Sessions saying that it had \u201cdetermined that there is reasonable cause to believe that violations of law may have occurred.\u201d The newly revealed documents, obtained through an unrelated lawsuit, show workers at Avion BPO in the Philippines focused on adding and promoting sexual ads. In some instances the workers used language including \u201cLet a young babe show you the way\u201d and \u201cLittle angel seeks daddy\u201d in fake ads they posted on other sites to attract customers to Backpage. A Backpage attorney did not respond to a request for comment on the letter Thursday. In various court cases, Dallas-based Backpage has contended that it aggressively screens for improper ads and is legally protected by the federal Communications Decency Act, which shields website operators against liability for content posted by their users. Backpage has long claimed that it was not involved in the creation of content on its site. The company also has stressed that when police or federal agents request help with cases, it complies quickly. Backpage and some advocates say that having the ads in one location is preferable to having the ads dispersed to sites in countries with less enforcement. Wagner and Maloney have also proposed an alteration to the Communications Decency Act clarifying that the 1996 law \u201cwas never intended to provide legal protection to websites that facilitate traffickers\u201d and enabling \u201cvigorous enforcement\u201d under both criminal and civil law for websites with content \u201crelating to sexual exploitation of children or sex trafficking.\u201d The bill was introduced in April and has 30 co-sponsors. It would also allow states to pursue criminal cases and victims to seek civil remedies. The Senate, whose Homeland Security Committee issued a scathing report on Backpage in January, is expected to introduce its own legislation. Both bills are certain to face serious opposition from those fearing abuse of the law and First Amendment violations that would inhibit the freedom of the Internet. In a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, Portman said he supported the Communications Decency Act but that it was not intended to protect people engaged in criminal activity. He cited the Post report as evidence that \u201cBackpage workers were active co-creators of many of these sex advertisements including those that seek to traffic women and underage girls. I believe the legal consequences should be that they should lose their immunity under the Communications Decency Act. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve asked the Justice Department today to review this matter.\u201d The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Backpage is an online classified-ad site similar to Craigslist. In 2010, after Craigslist closed its \u201cadult services\u201d section under intense pressure, many of the ads migrated to Backpage. The ads now in Backpage\u2019s \u201cdating\u201d section are seen by many as thinly veiled offers of prostitution, and underage women who have been trafficked on the site have come forward in recent years to detail their ordeals. In their letter to the attorney general, Wagner and Maloney urged Sessions to go after Backpage under an existing criminal law banning sex trafficking of children. \u201cWe see no reason,\u201d the congresswomen wrote, \u201cwhy a criminal case should not be brought against Backpage.com for its criminal role in sex trafficking in America.\u201d Backpage has said that it uses automated filters and human moderators to remove ads potentially involving trafficking of minors and other illegal activity.", "Title: Here\u2019s how an anti-prostitution campaign could threaten free speech online Content: A New Jersey federal judge is scheduled to consider today whether federal law preempts a state statute designed to crack down on online classified ads for underage prostitution. ( **Update:** the judge has enjoined the law, holding that it likely conflicts with federal law and the First Amendment.) Some anti- prostitution activists charge that sites such as backpage.com are knowingly profiting from the practice. But free speech advocates argue that efforts to censor the sites will undermine online freedom of speech more broadly. *[WSU]: Wayne State University At the heart of the controversy is a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which made it a crime to send \"indecent\" communications to minors. Ironically, while the Supreme Court in 1997 struck down the provisions of the CDA that restricted online speech, it left standing Section 230, which immunizes Internet service providers from liability for content posted by their users. Section 230 is beloved by free-speech advocates because it lets people operate uncensored online forums without worrying about being sued for their users' posts. *[WSU]: Wayne State University But the attorneys general of the 50 states are frustrated by Section 230. State officials have been pressuring the classified service backpage.com to shut down its \"adult personals\" section, which is sometimes used to advertise underage prostitutes. Backpage has refused, and the courts have supported the site. In 2011, a judge cited Section 230 to dismiss a lawsuit against Backpage by a woman who had been forced into child prostitution. Last year, a court blocked a Washington state law requiring companies to verify the ages of the subjects of online prostitution ads, holding that the law was preempted by Section 230. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Two weeks ago, the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter to key members of Congress asking for Section 230 to be revised. Right now, Section 230 immunizes Web site operators against civil _and_ criminal liability for their users' speech. The NAAG wants to narrow that so Web site owners are protected only against civil lawsuits, not criminal prosecution. *[WSU]: Wayne State University The NAAG letter provoked a response from a broad coalition of civil liberties groups, high-tech investors and legal scholars. They worry that narrowing Section 230 will undermine freedom of speech online. \"Section 230 is the legal cornerstone of the Internet economy, enabling the unprecedented scope of lawful commerce and free expression that the Internet supports today,\" they wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. The coalition warned that modifying Section 230 would \"jeopardize the continued growth of the entire Internet industry and the free expression rights of Internet users everywhere.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University Without Section 230, they warn, \"online service providers would expose themselves to potential prosecution under literally thousands of criminal statutes on a state-by-state basis. Keeping up with the thicket of state criminal laws would be a significant burden, especially for start-ups and smaller companies.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University Kevin Bankston, an attorney at the Center for Democracy & Technology, argues that the states' focus on Backpage is misplaced. \"Backpage cooperates with law enforcement in helping them find these people,\" he says. He points to a recent 70-city raid that \"resulted in the rescue of 105 teenagers and the arrest of 159 pimps.\" That operation was made possible because Backpage supplied law enforcement with information about who had posted ads. *[WSU]: Wayne State University But Jill Habig, a legal adviser to California attorney general Kamala Harris, argues that merely cooperating with law enforcement isn't enough to exonerate Backpage for its role in child prostitution. \"In criminal law, you have liability for someone who is an accomplice to a crime,\" she says. \"Backpage is used to profit from the sale of human beings.\" Bankston counters that there's little reason to think Backpage would be found liable as an accomplice to prostitution even without Section 230 on the books. In his 2011 ruling holding that Backpage was protected by Section 230, Judge Thomas C. Mummert also found that the plaintiff did not \"describe the specific intent required for aiding and abetting.\" Bankston says that \"even if [CDA Section 230] hadn't existed, that case would have been dismissed.\" Similarly, Bankston said, the Washington age-verification statute probably would have been struck down on First Amendment grounds if Section 230 wasn't on the books. \"Although they characterize this as a narrow fix, this is an incredibly broad proposal for a very narrow, specific problem,\" Bankston says. \"We're talking about opening [online service providers] up to liability for a wide range of criminal defamation statutes, state privacy laws, a practically unlimited array of potential liability that would send any sensible investor running away from any kind of user-generated content play,\" Bankston warns. Most important, Banston argues, exposing Web sites to liability for their users' speech \"would be devastating to the free expression environment online.\" Section 230, he says, \"is as important to free speech online as the First Amendment.\"", "Title: Lies, damned lies and sex work statistics Content: ( _Maggie McNeill is a retired call girl. She writes at her blog,The Honest Courtesan.)_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University Imagine a study of the alcohol industry which interviewed not a single brewer, wine expert, liquor store owner or drinker, but instead relied solely on the statements of ATF agents, dry-county politicians and members of Alcoholics Anonymous and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Or how about a report on restaurants which treated the opinions of failed hot dog stand operators as the basis for broad statements about every kind of food business from convenience stores to food trucks to McDonald\u2019s to five-star restaurants? You\u2019d probably surmise that this sort of research would be biased and one- sided to the point of unreliable. And you\u2019d be correct. But change the topic to sex work, and such methods are not only the norm, they\u2019re accepted uncritically by the media and the majority of those who the resulting studies. In fact, many of those who represent themselves as sex work researchers don\u2019t even _try_ to get good data. They simply present their opinions as fact, occasionally bolstered by pseudo-studies designed to produce pre-determined results. Well-known and easily-contacted sex workers are rarely consulted . There\u2019s no peer review. And when sex workers are consulted at all, they\u2019re recruited from jails and substance abuse programs, resulting in a sample skewed heavily toward the desperate, the disadvantaged and the marginalized. *[WSU]: Wayne State University This sort of statistical malpractice has always been typical of prostitution research. But the incentive to produce it has dramatically increased in the past decade, thanks to a media-fueled moral panic over sex trafficking. Sex- work prohibitionists have long seen trafficking and sex slavery as a useful Trojan horse. In its 2010 \u201cnational action plan,\u201d for example, the activist group Demand Abolition writes,\u201cFraming the Campaign\u2019s key target as sexual slavery might garner more support and less resistance, while framing the Campaign as combating prostitution may be less likely to mobilize similar levels of support and to stimulate stronger opposition.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University But as sex worker rights organizations have repeatedly pointed out (as have organizations like UNAIDS, Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International), those who are truly interested in decreasing exploitation in the sex industry would be better off supporting decriminalization of prostitution. New South Wales, Australia, decriminalized sex work in 1995, and a subsequent government-sponsored 2012 study found \u201d . . . no evidence of recent trafficking of female sex workers . . . in marked contrast to the 1990s when contacted women from Thailand were common in Sydney . . . \u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University New Zealand legalized prostitution in 2003. A study by the New Zealand Ministry of Justice five years later found \u201cno incidence of trafficking,\u201d and sex worker advocates say the law has made it easier for sex workers to report abuse, and for law enforcement to make arrests for crimes against sex workers. Some anti-prostitution activists have tried to claim that Germany\u2019s liberal form of legalization has encouraged sex trafficking. But they actually cite coercion among _illegal_ sex workers (for example, those who are too young to legally work at a German brothel) and claim that their exploitation had somehow been caused by the legal framework from which those women had been excluded. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Despite plenty of evidence of the harm caused by criminalization, there\u2019s still a tremendous amount of money in representing it as the \u201ccure\u201d for a situation it actually exacerbates. In an interview last May, Michael Horowitz, a fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute who led efforts to pass the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that the anti-trafficking movement has become more about securing grants for research than protecting victims. \u201cNow it\u2019s just one big federal entitlement program,\u201d he said, \u201cand everybody is more worried about where they\u2019re going to get their next grant.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University Most of the scary articles about sex trafficking are larded with inflated figures and phony statistics that don\u2019t survive any serious analysis. For example, you will often read that the average sex worker enters the trade at 13, a mathematical impossibility which appears to have originated as a misrepresentation of the average age of first _noncommercial_ sexual contact (which could include kissing, petting, etc.) reported by _underage_ girls in one 1982 study as though it were the age they first reported selling sex. The actual average age at which they began prostitution was 16. And though the number was already dubious when applied to underage prostitutes, it became wholly ludicrous when applied to all sex workers. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Because prostitution is illegal in most of the world, the most reliable data on the proportion of sex workers that are underage will come from places where the industry is legal and it can be studied openly, like New Zealand. And there, estimates put the figure at about 3.5%. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Another common claim is that there are 100,000 to 300,000 children locked in sex slavery in the U.S. (For just a few examples, see here, here, here, here, and here. ) That number is a distortion of a figure from a 2001 study by Richard Estes and Neil Weiner of the University of Pennsylvania, which estimated that number of \u201cchildren, adolescents and youth (up to 21) **_at risk_** of sexual **_exploitation_**.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cSex trafficking\u201d was the _least_ prevalent form of \u201cexploitation\u201d in their definition. Other forms included stripping, consensual homosexual relations, and merely _viewing_ porn. Moreover, two of the so-called \u201crisk factors\u201d were access to a car and proximity to the Canadian or Mexican border. In a 2011 interview, Estes himself estimated the number of legal minors actually abducted into \u201csex slavery\u201d was \u201d very small . . . {w}e\u2019re talking about a few hundred people.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University Yet the myth persists. The Dallas Morning News recently took the figure to new levels of preposterousness, claiming in an editorial last November that, \u201cIn Houston alone, about 300,000 sex trafficking cases are prosecuted each year.\u201d As defense attorney Mark Bennett pointed out on his blog, the actual figure was two. Not 200,000. Just two. The paper did print a correction, though the correction simply deleted the original 300,000 figure from the editorial. The paper still didn\u2019t bother to mention the actual number, perhaps it didn\u2019t support the alarmism in the rest of the editorial. *[WSU]: Wayne State University And the distortions go on. One of the more comical incidents occurred in 2011, when an activist group called the Women\u2019s Funding Network put out a study alleging that ads for underage sex trafficking on websites like Craigslist and Backpage.com had \u201crisen exponentially in three diverse states.\u201d The claim was picked up by media outlets across the country, including USA Today, the Houston Chronicle, the Miami Herald, the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and the Detroit Free Press. The Village Voice, which owns Backpage.com, took a look at the methodology, a term that flatters what the study\u2019s authors actually did. They merely asked a small sample group of people to _guess_ the age of women pictured in ads for escort and erotic massage services. They then just assumed that the guesses were correct, and extrapolated the percentage of \u201cunderage\u201d women in their sample set of photos were indicative of online sex ads in general. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Not surprisingly, none authors of the \u201cstudy\u201d were credentialed academics. Still, it inspired not only a wave of media coverage, but outrage from state attorneys general and members of Congress, and promises for new laws. The activists knew exactly what they were doing. As the director of the group that conducted the study told the Voice, \u201cWe pitch {a study} the way we think you\u2019re going to read it and pick up on it. If we give it to you with all the words and the stuff that is actually accurate \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve tried to do that with our PR firm, and they say, \u2018They won\u2019t read that much.'\u201d There have been two more highly-publicized examples of this phenomenon in just the past few weeks. The first was a study funded by Cindy McCain and led by Dr. Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, an anti-prostitution crusader responsible for a controversial \u201cdiversion\u201d program in Phoenix, Arizona. It claimed to have \u201cproven\u201d an increase of \u201csex trafficking\u201d in northern New Jersey near the time of the Super Bowl, and was apparently conducted to counter the evidence that this annual story \u2014 that Super Bowls bring sex slaves\u201d \u2014 is largely hype. The researchers claim to have subjected sex workers\u2019 ads from Backpage.com to a \u201ctrafficking matrix.\u201d The report doesn\u2019t offer much explanation about how this \u201cmatrix\u201d was designed and tested, but the text in the report indicates that among its dubious premises are the claims that tattoos are a sign of trafficking, and the dubious claim that the term _kitty_ (a euphemism for female genitalia) is code for \u201cunderage.\u201d Despite the absence of methodological design data and the obvious lack of experimental controls, the authors nonetheless boldly assert that 83.7% of the ads \u201cshowed signs of trafficking.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University The other example is a study from the Urban Institute that was widely touted in the media last week (including here at The Washington Post). The researchers made bold statements about the \u201cU.S. sex economy\u201d based on interviews with law enforcement personnel, 73 men convicted as \u201cpimps,\u201d and only 36 incarcerated street workers. As the sex worker activist Melissa Gira Grant observed, the average sex worker activist follows more sex workers on Twitter than these researchers managed to find for a supposedly \u201clandmark\u201d study. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Furthermore, the report\u2019s bias is clear from the skewed proportion of its interviewees: Street workers represent less than 15 percent of the trade, but were _100 percent_ of the sex workers interviewed for the study. Moreover, fewer than half of street workers have pimps, and about half of the pimps are actually the employees of the women they manage, not the other way around. Yet the researchers interviewed twice as many pimps as sex workers, thus inflating their perceived importance remarkably. *[WSU]: Wayne State University To the extent that it exists, coerced sex work is of course abominable, and it should be prosecuted. But the media needs to be far more skeptical of the claims of anti-sex worker activists, including those that advocate from government perches. Uncritically repeating exaggerated claims and fabricated data may seem innocuous \u2014 after all, what harm could there be in drawing more attention to the issue? But when all sex work is illegal, consensual, of-age sex workers are far more reluctant to report coercion, abusive pimps, and underage prostitutes for fear of being arrested themselves. This makes actual sex trafficking more difficult to discover. These moral panic proclamations and exaggerated or fabricated statistics are coming from activists who want stricter laws to criminalize prostitution, thus pushing it further underground. Spreading their message will only make actual sex slavery more difficult to detect."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage directly addresses the query by explaining the legal protection that websites like Backpage.com have under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which immunizes Internet service providers from liability for content posted by their users.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to the other passages, this one provides the most comprehensive explanation of why websites where children are prostituted can be immune from prosecution.", "direct_answer_sentence": "At the heart of the controversy is a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which made it a crime to send \"indecent\" communications to minors.

The report recommended major changes to how the city pays charters, suggesting that payments reflect actual enrollment throughout the year rather than projected enrollment or one-time audits. It also called for the D.C. Council to consider legislation that would require private management companies to provide more information about their finances. \u201cHaving transparency in how we use all public school dollars is critically important,\u201d Jennifer Niles, deputy mayor for education, said in a news conference after the findings were released. \u201cWhile there has been great progress and, overall, significant transparency, there is still more work to do.\u201d The audit examined financial documents and transactions between fiscal 2011 and 2013, monitoring the flow of more than $1.5 billion in local tax dollars. Auditors looked at a broad scope of financial oversight functions, including how the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) certified summer-school enrollments and whether the D.C. Public Charter School Board was monitoring whether each charter school carried insurance. Concerns about financial transparency at charter schools have been amplified in recent years, with the D.C. attorney general filing two lawsuits related to payments made to for-profit management companies that run D.C. charter schools. In one suit, court documents show that the founder of Community Academy Public Charter School, Kent Amos, paid himself more than $1 million to lead the school via a management company. The other lawsuit involves three former leaders of Options Public Charter, a school for at-risk teens. They allegedly diverted funds to two for-profit management companies they ran. The charter board in both cases gave schools favorable ratings for their financial performance during oversight reviews. Charter board officials said their watchdog abilities were limited because they could not see the private company\u2019s financial records. To help with oversight, the report by the Office of the D.C. Auditor urged the D.C. Council to require that for-profit management firms provide the same level of financial information that nonprofit organizations provide. D.C. Council members David Grosso (I-At Large) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large) introduced a bill last month to achieve that goal. The report also recommended adjusting payments to charter schools for transfers that occur after the annual October enrollment audit. Per-pupil city funding is awarded to charters based on the October audit, while D.C. public schools receive funding based on projected enrollments. Critics say the system encourages traditional schools to inflate projections and charter schools to let go of students later in the year. Niles said she wants to adopt a system that offers positive incentives. \u201cWe want to reduce mobility during an individual school year as much as possible,\u201d she said. The report noted that the charter board has made significant improvements to its oversight, introducing an online database that makes it easier to file and track financial records. Early on, auditors could not find evidence that all annual financial and compliance reviews were conducted. The report also found missing documentation regarding charter school contracting; charters are required to enter a competitive bidding process for contracts of more than $25,000. The charter board said in a response to the report that it has improved its oversight of contracting since 2013 and hired a specialist last year to more thoroughly monitor charter school finances. In its review of OSSE, the audit found that the state-level agency was doing a good job of overseeing special education payments to schools and that students were receiving the level of service that their schools were being compensated to provide. But it said the agency did not verify summer-school payments to see whether schools were enrolling the number of students they were paid to serve.", "Title: Union-backed group calls for pause in federal money for charter schools Content: A labor-backed group is objecting to a U.S. Education Department proposal to expand federal funding for public charter schools, after the agency\u2019s inspector general issued a scathing report that found deficiencies in how the department handled federal grants to charter schools between 2008 and 2011. The inspector general discovered some charter schools received federal dollars but never opened their doors to students, and the agency could not say where the money went. The department has given $1.7 billion in grants to charter schools since fiscal 2009, according to an agency spokeswoman. In its budget request for 2016, the Obama administration is seeking $375 million for the program \u2014 a 48 percent increase over current funding levels. Public charter schools are funded by tax dollars but managed privately and often are not unionized. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has been a strong advocate for charter schools, a position that puts him at odds with teachers unions. The Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, which includes the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers and the Service Employees International Union, wrote to Duncan on Monday, asking how his agency could seek to expand the charter schools program \u201cdespite mounting evidence of significant fraud, waste and abuse within the charter sector, and despite the warnings of your own office of inspector general that federal charter start-up and expansion funds are not adequately monitored or accounted for.\u201d The inspector general found that the department had been lax in making sure federal dollars were spent in accordance with the law and failed to follow up when others flagged problems.For example, state officials in Florida found \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in 2008, but it took the federal agency 29 months to react. And when it did, it deemed the Florida problems \u201cresolved,\u201d but the inspector general later found those same problems persisted. Federal dollars find their way to charter schools through two routes. In most cases, the federal government awards money to a state, and the state hands out grants to charter schools. In some instances, the federal government directly awards money to a public charter school. But the inspector general found lax oversight in both categories of charter school grants, with the federal agency failing to review the fiscal activities of charter schools that received federal dollars. In addition, the staff at the department in charge of the charter schools program didn\u2019t have adequate training in fiscal and program monitoring, the audit found. \u201cThere is a heightened risk that grantees were not fully complying with program goals and objectives as well as federal laws and regulations,\u201d the inspector general found. \u201cAs a result, there is increased risk that department funds were not used for the intent and purpose of the program.\u201d The alliance is seeking a moratorium on new federal funding for public charter schools. Its letter to Duncan asks what specific actions the department has taken since 2012 to step up monitoring and accountability regarding charter school grants. Nadya Dabby, an assistant deputy secretary, said her agency has completed 14 of 17 corrective actions outlined by the inspector general and has added staff to the charter program to improve monitoring. Still, the federal role is largely focused on funding and not direct oversight of the grants, Dabby said. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of states to make sure they develop and submit plans for subgrantee monitoring,\u201d she said. The inspector general looked at three states \u2014 Arizona, California and Florida \u2014 and found multiple weaknesses in the ways those states oversaw federal dollars sent to charter schools. California state officials were \u201cunqualified to conduct onsite monitoring of charter schools,\u201d the inspector general found. Of 13 state employees responsible for visiting charter schools, seven did not have the necessary experience and the state could not provide qualifications for two more, the audit said. Some of those state employees told the inspector general\u2019s staff that they felt \u201cawkward\u201d conducting site visits because they didn\u2019t know much about charters and fiscal matters. In the three states that were audited, the inspector general found that 26 charter schools either closed during the audit period or never opened their doors to students. The schools had received a total of about $7 million in federal funds. In Florida and California, there was no record of what happened to the equipment, supplies or anything else purchased with the federal dollars for schools that never opened, the audit said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t holding states responsible for monitoring these programs,\u201d Dabby said. \u201cWe had to make our standards clear to them in respect to fiscal oversight and also have them thinking very clearly about the quality of education offered to their students.\u201d The Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools wants the Department of Education to maintain a public database of charter schools that receive federal grants, the students served and the operational and academic performance of each school. Dabby said the department collects only the names of charter schools that receive federal funds and that states are expected to maintain the other information. She said agency officials have not decided whether to create the public database requested by the alliance.", "Title: Charter love: Feds give $157 million to expand charter schools Content: The U.S. Department of Education announced Monday it would give $157 million to create and expand charter schools throughout the nation, despite criticisms by its inspector general in the past that the agency has done a poor job of overseeing federal dollars sent to charter schools. Education Secretary Arne Duncan made a passing reference to oversight problems during a media call with reporters. \u201cSome have had to fold, some are struggling to find their way,\u201d he said, referring to poor-performing charter schools. \u201cWe know we have to strengthen oversight\u2026 The good news is that the sector has proven it can improve.\u201d With the addition of Monday\u2019s grants, the department has awarded more than $3 billion to charter schools since fiscal 1995. Federal dollars find their way to charter schools through two routes. In most cases, the federal government awards money to a state, and the state hands out grants to charter schools. In some instances, the federal government directly awards money to a public charter school. But the federal government has not tracked how its dollars have been used by charter schools, nor has it studied their academic performance. Asked how taxpayers can be assured that federal dollars will be spent properly, Duncan said it was largely up to states and the public agencies that approve charter schools. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that from the academic side and the fiscal side that [charter school] authorizers and states hold charters accountable,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cAt the federal level, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of leverage. But we can really challenge states.\u201d The department sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to states, emphasizing the importance of financial accountability for charter schools receiving federal dollars. Duncan also said that his agency plans for the first time to publicly report some data, including the names of some schools that have received federal grants and their performance statistics. The agency\u2019s inspector general issued a scathing report in 2012 that found deficiencies in how the department handled federal grants to charter schools between 2008 and 2011. The inspector general discovered dozens of charter schools received federal dollars but never opened their doors to students. The schools received millions in federal funds, but there was no record of what happened to the equipment, supplies or anything else purchased with the federal dollars for schools that never opened, the audit said. Public charter schools are funded by tax dollars but managed privately and often are not unionized. Duncan has been a strong advocate for charter schools. \u201cWe need more great public schools of all kinds,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cToo often, charter school successes are isolated and don\u2019t have an impact beyond the walls of their own buildings...We\u2019re helping [charter] schools to scale.\u201d For Scott Given, the founder of the UP Education Network, which operates five charter schools in Massachusetts, the $2.2 million grant means his chain can grow to 20 schools by 2020. Unlike most other charters, UP Education takes over existing public schools that have been chronically underperforming, accepting all students. Up Education Network was among 12 charter organizations that won grants, including some well-known names such as Success Academy, the largest operator of charters in New York City, and the Noble Network of Chicago. Seven states and Washington, D.C. won grants, including Ohio, which got the largest single award of $32.5 million. Ohio has also been at the center of several recent charter school scandals, from the Ohio state auditor finding some charters had inflated enrollment figures to evidence that some state officials inflated evaluations of charters.

It may well succeed because of a convergence of exponentially advancing technologies, such as computing, artificial intelligence, sensors, and genomic sequencing. We\u2019re going to see more medical advances in the next decade than happened in the past century. We already wear devices, such as the Fitbit and Apple Watch, which monitor our physical activities, sleep cycles, and stress and energy levels and upload these data to distributed servers via our smartphones. And those smartphones contain countless applications to keep track of our vitals and gauge our emotional and psychological states. Then there is sequencing of the human genome, first completed in 2001 at a cost of about $3 billion. It\u2019s possible today for about $1,000, with costs falling so fast that, by 2022, genome sequencing may be cheaper than a blood test. Now that it has been mapped into bits that computers can process, the genome has become an information technology. With increasingly large sample sizes and tools such as IBM\u2019s A.I. system, Watson, scientists are gaining an understanding of how our genes affect our health; how the environment, the food we eat, and the medicines we take affect the complex interplay between our genes and our organisms. The next big medical frontier is on the horizon: our microbiomes, the bacterial populations that live inside our bodies. We may think we are just made up of cells, but in reality there are 10 times as many microbes in our body as cells. This is a field that I am most excited about, because it takes us back to looking at the human organism as a whole. The microbiome may be the missing link between environment, genomics, and human health. Within a few years, our genome, microbiome, behavior and environment will all be mapped and measured, and prescriptive-medicine systems based on artificial intelligence will help us feel better and live longer. Yes, it will take time for the inventions to get from the lab to people in need, and the technology elite will have these before the rest of us. But this will only be for a short period, because the way the tech industry builds value is by democratizing technology, reducing its cost and enabling it to reach billions. This is why I am so excited that companies such as IBM, Facebook, and Google are taking the mantle from the health-care industry. These companies have a motivation to keep us healthy: so that we download more applications rather than remain hooked on prescription medicines.", "Title: Why we should believe the dreamers \u2014 and not the experts Content: History is littered with the failed predictions of experts. Yet governments hire high-paid consultants to advise on policy; businesses use them to vet research and development projects; and venture capitalists have them make investment decisions. Experts excel in looking backwards, protecting their turf, and saying what their clients want to hear. Their short-term predictions are sometimes right, but they are almost always wrong in forecasting any more-distant future. Experts are the greatest inhibitors of innovation\u2014the ones who shouldn\u2019t be listened to. Peter Diamandis says it best: \u201cAn expert is someone who can tell you exactly how it can\u2019t be done.\u201d Look at some of the most famous historical examples: The problem with experts is that they think they know it all; ignore data that don\u2019t fit their points of view; and extrapolate from the past on a linear basis. If some disruptive technology hasn\u2019t come along in the past, the assumption is that it won\u2019t happen in the future. What\u2019s worse is that experts often try to block technologies that might up-end their roles. After all, if things change too fast, they will no longer be experts. You see these specialists in governments, businesses, and academia. Government experts usually have an agenda. Business experts are typically old-timers trying to protect their jobs. Academics specialize in digging deep into fields that most people would consider arcane or obscure. They gain tenure by writing academic papers and being extremely knowledgeable in a narrow area. They often remain in the same field for decades and can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Technology is, today, moving faster than ever. Advances that took decades, sometime centuries, such as the development of telephones, airplanes, and the first computers, now happen in years. Witness how smartphones and social media have come out of nowhere in the past seven years and changed the way we interact and communicate. We are always connected to each other and to our employers. Computing power is advancing at exponential rates and causing acceleration in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, sensors, and medicine. When advancing technologies converge, they lead to artificial intelligence\u2013based apps that analyze data from medical sensors, with the potential to disrupt the medical industry. Smartphones apps such as Uber and AirBnb are already threatening transportation and lodging. Amazon.com has made bookstores disappear and Apple has changed the music industry. Which experts ever predicted these disruptions? The experts are becoming more wrong\u2014and irrelevant\u2014than ever. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Silicon Valley\u2019s most respected venture capitalists can\u2019t see even the near future. Mary Meeker of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers produces a yearly report, Internet Trends, which is the tech industry\u2019s bible. Its May 2013 report analyzed the leading players in social media and made predictions on the future of mobile technologies. It did not even mention WhatsApp\u2014which Facebook acquired for $19 billion in February 2014. This was the largest acquisition in history of a venture-backed company and was not even on Meeker\u2019s radar. As an academic expert in advancing technologies, I may lack the credibility to write this article. When entrepreneurs come to me for advice, I tell them, as I am telling you, to take it for what it\u2019s worth. No one can accurately predict the future of business any more, because too much is happening too fast. At best, you can gain an understanding of the overall trends and the types of opportunities and obstacles that lie ahead. You can look backwards to understand what problems have already been solved, how others overcame hurdles, and what types of business strategies worked best. You can learn what questions to ask. You can realize yourself when your idea is either just plain silly or impractical. I tell entrepreneurs that if they really believe in their gut that they have a world-changing idea, then they should pursue it. They shouldn\u2019t let anyone stop them\u2014no one really knows more than they do. As Peter Diamandis also says \u201cThe day before something is a breakthrough, it\u2019s a crazy idea.\u201d", "Title: Culture warrior Rick Santorum joins the Republican race Content: RICK SANTORUM officially entered the GOP presidential race Wednesday, pitching himself as an economic populist in touch with working-class voters suspicious of both \u201cbig government and big business.\u201d So his candidacy may test how strong populist sentiment has become among the Republican rank and file \u2014 if, that is, he is seen as anything more than the Christian moralizer he has become famous for playing. Mr. Santorum has been among the sternest of culture warriors over the past three decades. His most notable legislative accomplishment in 12 years in the Senate was shepherding a bill that banned late-term abortions. He also successfully pushed restrictions on \u201cfetus farming\u201d for research or medical purposes. Part of his breakthrough in the 2012 GOP contest owed to his frank discussions about raising a child with a life-threatening disability; he brought her onstage Wednesday. He stresses the importance of family, pointing out that government can\u2019t read bedtime stories to children. Yet just as often he strikes a sour note, as when he recently said that he wouldn\u2019t attend a gay wedding. Mr. Santorum will face strong competition from Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and others for the evangelical Christian voters who propelled his 2012 campaign. He is therefore emphasizing his sympathies with working-class voters. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, this is a piece of coal,\u201d he said Wednesday, brandishing a chunk of black rock and explaining that his grandfather worked in the mines after fleeing fascist Italy. In his campaign book, \u201cBlue Collar Conservatives,\u201d Mr. Santorum argues that the GOP needs to woo \u201cmiddle- and lower-middle-income Americans from industrial and rural communities with generally conservative values,\u201d millions of whom stayed home in 2012. These \u201cblue-jeaned workers,\u201d he says, \u201chave been left behind and see little hope for the future.\u201d He supports raising the minimum wage and criticizes other Republicans\u2019 preoccupation with cutting taxes for the wealthy. Neither of these positions is outrageous. But they, along with seemingly everything else Mr. Santorum believes, emerge from a backward-looking traditionalism that esteems an imperfect past and condemns the reforms of the past several decades. \u201cDramatic, dangerous changes are taking place in America,\u201d he hyperbolically warns in his book, in which he laments the erosion of the U.S. manufacturing economy and the \u201ccoarsening\u201d of society. \u201cThe greatest threat to the average American\u2019s achieving his dream today is a dysfunctional culture,\u201d he insists. This line of thinking dismisses the progress of recent years, such as on gay and lesbian rights, and encourages overheated attacks on globalization and free trade. For now, Mr. Santorum\u2019s pitch doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating, either because it\u2019s not what rank-and-file Republicans want or because they don\u2019t believe he is the best exponent of these values. He might not even make it into the first GOP debate, scheduled for August, which will exclude candidates without decent poll numbers. He surprised many when he won 11 primary and caucus states in 2012. If his aggressive, populist touch works as well in the competitive 2016 environment, it will be far more unexpected. **Read more about this topic:** George F.

Lander is president and founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University. Eric E. Schmidt is the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google._ For more than a half century, the United States has operated what might be called a \u201cMiracle Machine.\u201d Powered by federal investment in science and technology, the machine regularly churns out breathtaking advances. The Miracle Machine has transformed the way we live and work, strengthened national defense and revolutionized medicine. It has birthed entire industries \u2014 organized around computers, biotechnology, energy and communications \u2014 creating millions of jobs. It\u2019s the reason the United States is the global hub for the technologies of the future: self-driving cars, genome editing, artificial intelligence, cancer immunotherapy, quantum computers and more. Our machine is the envy of the world. And yet, while other nations, such as China, are working furiously to develop their own Miracle Machines, we\u2019ve been neglecting ours. Though historically a bipartisan priority, science and technology funding has steadily eroded over the past decade. One example among many: Adjusted for inflation, the budget for the National Institutes of Health, the federal medical research agency, has fallen since 2003 by nearly 25 percent . If the Trump administration and Congress want to ensure that the United States remains the most powerful nation in the world, they should embrace and support our Miracle Machine. The spending bill that Congress passed this week represents a good step, but there\u2019s still a long way to go to recover lost ground and secure our leadership. The Miracle Machine can be traced back to a report during the closing days of World War II called \u201cScience: The Endless Frontier.\u201d The blueprint saw the power of bringing together two interlocking engines \u2014 the public sector and the private sector \u2014 to drive progress and innovation. The United States has the most dynamic private sector in the world, with entrepreneurs, investors, big companies and capital markets all eager to license technologies and launch start-ups. But those ventures are often driven by technologies that come from basic research. Few companies undertake such research because its fruits are typically too unpredictable, too far from commercialization and too early to be patentable. That\u2019s where government comes in. While investing in basic research typically doesn\u2019t make sense for a business, it has been a winning strategy for our nation. For 60 years, the federal government has invested roughly a penny on each dollar in the federal budget into research at universities and research centers. In turn, these institutions have produced a torrent of discoveries and trained generations of scientific talent, fueling new companies and spawning new jobs. For starters, investing in curiosity about the natural world has paid stunning dividends. Exploration of bacteria that thrive in geysers or salt flats led to breakthrough tools that can make millions of copies of DNA molecules, repair disease-causing mutations in living cells and use light pulses to fire nerve cells. Studies of fruit fly embryos led to drugs to treat skin cancer. Academic ideas inspired by neurons ultimately led to the artificial- intelligence revolution that is transforming industry today. Building powerful tools without worrying about precisely how they\u2019ll be used has also turned out to be a great public investment strategy. Fundamental physics studies, funded by public investment, gave us high-energy particle accelerators, which are now a mainstay in pharmaceutical drug development, and atomic clocks, which enable the Global Positioning System that guides travelers to their destinations. And we\u2019ve witnessed firsthand that creating and sharing mountains of scientific data can drive both exploration and commercialization. The $4 billion NIH investment in the Human Genome Project, which one of us (Lander) co-led, dramatically accelerated the understanding of human disease \u2014 and unleashed roughly $1 trillion in economic activity. That\u2019s like $5 in a savings account growing to $1,250. Finally, tackling novel engineering challenges has laid the foundation for new industries. In the late 1960s, federal grants to universities to explore message-passing among computers led directly to the Internet. A $4.5 million National Science Foundation grant to Stanford University in 1994, to explore the idea of digital libraries, helped contribute five years later to the creation of Google. Today, the U.S. taxes paid each year by the company and by its more than 40,000 domestic employees total in the billions \u2014 a good portion of the NSF\u2019s annual $7 billion budget. Crucially, when scientific breakthroughs spawn new industries and jobs, those benefits occur right here in the United States \u2014 because companies want to remain close to the flow of new discoveries and experienced workers. The Miracle Machine has been astoundingly successful. The problem is that too few people \u2014 in government or in the public \u2014 know how it works. As a result, we\u2019ve been letting it fall into disrepair. If we don\u2019t change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America\u2019s greatest advantages. To our lasting detriment, we may wake up to find the next generation of technologies, industries, medicines and armaments being pioneered elsewhere. **Read more on this topic:** Alan Townsend: Science might save my daughter.

So when patients are upset about a long wait in the emergency department, or a doctor\u2019s brusque manner, or a meal that never arrived in a room, Geisinger is doing more than apologizing. It\u2019s offering money back on their care, no questions asked. The hospital system is the first in the country to adopt what has long been a basic tenet of retail business: customer refunds. This focus on customer satisfaction is a relatively new concept for health care, in which doctors have typically called the shots. And it\u2019s one that Geisinger\u2019s staff questioned when president and chief executive David Feinberg came up with the refund idea last fall. But the novel approach is in keeping with health care\u2019s shift to improve the experience of patients. Under the Affordable Care Act, government payments are increasingly tied to the quality of care and patient satisfaction as opposed to the quantity of services provided. \u201cWe want to make sure we not only have the right care that is high quality and safe, but we also want to make sure our care is compassionate, dignified and delivered with a lot of kindness,\u201d said Feinberg, who took over Geisinger last May after running the UCLA health system. One 49-year-old patient received a $210 refund in February after an appointment left her in tears. \u201cPt felt like they didn\u2019t care and did not have her best interest at heart. Pt. stated she came to Geisinger b/c she trusted us, she has no trust now,\u201d according to the financial authorization for the refund. Karen Hull was upset, too, and not just over the chicken panini that took hours to be delivered after her successful surgery in January. Several weeks earlier, the Geisinger Medical Center finance department had blindsided the 46-year-old dental hygienist with a call for a \u201cdown payment\u201d on her operation, for a herniated disc that had caused crippling pain. \u201cI remember thinking, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to skip out on my back surgery,\u201d she said. She wound up paying $100 toward her $2,375 co-payment. __ After she got home, she asked for a $150 refund \u2014 an amount that reflected her distress but didn\u2019t make her look \u201choggish.\u201d Hers was among the 74 requests that Geisinger received between October and mid-March. In response to those requests, the system refunded or waived charges of nearly $80,000, officials said. Only co-payments and deductibles can be considered. When Feinberg first announced the program, which began as a pilot and then was expanded to all patients systemwide in early April, other industry executives told him it was \u201ca dumb idea,\u201d he said. But there is less skepticism now given how the feedback already has boosted patient satisfaction scores, a key metric the federal government uses to pay hospitals. Industry executives at a recent health-plan meeting were \u201cblown away\u201d after hearing the CEO\u2019s presentation, recalled Ceci Connolly, president and chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. The organization represents 22 health plans and provider groups, including Geisinger. \u201cIt is sad and ironic that a business that has decided to listen to its customers and be responsive and even occasionally refund some money is considered so out-of-the box,\u201d Connolly noted. At least one other system \u2014 University of Utah Health Care \u2014 is looking into a similar program. In recent years, hospitals nationwide have sought to make care more customer-friendly, with staff retraining and new programs. Yet Geisinger\u2019s move is perhaps the boldest innovation by a system long known for reinventing medical care. A decade ago, for example, Geisinger introduced a 90-day warranty for surgery patients. Its size and its integration of hospitals, doctor practices and insurance helps to make that possible. It is one of the country\u2019s largest health systems, with 10 hospitals serving more than 3 million residents in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, and it claims more than 500,000 members in a health coverage plan it offers. The refund program is in place only at the Pennsylvania facilities. \u201cThey can make the math work,\u201d compensating for short-term losses on refunds through longer-term relationships with the insurance customers, Connolly said. Skeptics\u2019 worries that greedy patients would abuse the system and cite any reason in demanding money back have not proved warranted. And Feinberg maintains that the refund process provides Geisinger with valuable information, spotlighting areas that need improvement. The amounts, which are limited to a patient\u2019s maximum co-pay or deductible, have ranged from $20 to a few thousand dollars. \u201cWe have a built-in secret-shopper program, and the patient is telling us when we get it right,\u201d he said. Most feedback has been positive. Refunds represent \u201cfamilies who had to wait in the emergency room for too long, or were treated by a doctor in an abrupt manner, or the nurse got too caught up in what she was doing and forgot to hold someone\u2019s hand,\u201d he said. Maureen Bisognano, president emerita at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement, agrees. \u201cIf you went out to get a consultant to teach you how to improve patient experience, it would be a lot more than [$80,000],\u201d she said. Plus, the system\u2019s approach gives it real-time feedback \u201cright at the moment of care about what needs to be fixed.\u201d Most important, she said, it sends a message to patients that Geisinger trusts them. ProvenExperience, as the program is called, allows patients to get refunds in a variety of ways. The quickest is through a specially designed mobile app \u2014 a free one \u2014 on which patients can rate their experience and put in for a refund for services that took place beginning last November. Requests are typically processed in three to five business days. __At the same time, any of Geisinger\u2019s 30,000 employees can reach out to patients who feel their service or experience is \u201cnot good.\u201d Employees can provide \u201cservice recovery\u201d with free lunch or dinner vouchers, parking passes or gift certificates for the hospital gift shop. That is also how the system deals with unhappy Medicare patients. The uninsured can get financial credit on a case-by-case basis, officials said. Though the ultimate goal is to improve patient experience, \u201cthe money piece gives us skin in the game,\u201d said neurosurgeon Jonathan Slotkin, who helped design the program. The top refund requests reflect issues common to many hospitals, including complaints about poor communication with the staff, parking, noisy hospital rooms and billing issues. Some requests come directly from Feinberg, who visits regularly with patients throughout the system and jots down his cellphone number when he hands out his business card. Feinberg said Geisinger is already making improvements, starting with a new corporate chef to come up with better menus at each hospital. Other changes will take a bit longer. To address emergency-room backlogs, he is working on a plan to eliminate all wait times within three years. That may involve new online registration and ER waiting rooms that could be turned into clinical space where doctors would treat non-emergency patients. To improve communication, all employees are getting new training to ensure they always introduce themselves to patients, ask permission before performing procedures and tell patients what is coming next. Within Geisinger, some staffers are afraid that there will be repercussions if a patient wants money back. \u201cIf a patient of mine asks for a refund, does that reflect I am a poor-quality physician? I have those own internal fears myself,\u201d Slotkin acknowledged. At a more fundamental level, he said, it is a cultural change for doctors who were trained to treat relationships with patients as \u201csacrosanct and precious\u201d \u2014 and certainly different from selling shoes or sofas. \u201cPeople don\u2019t respond to change well,\u201d said Anthony Petrick, who heads bariatric surgery at Geisinger. But he and others said they also understand that as patients pay an ever-greater share of the cost of their care, hospitals need to understand that they are customers who must be treated with dignity and respect. Kim Walsh didn\u2019t even know she could get money back. The pharmacist, 51, had undergone thyroid surgery in December. The operation was successful, but her stay was calamitous. At Geisinger\u2019s Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., Walsh was assigned a room with no toilet. She had to use a public bathroom, which meant asking staff for help to get out of bed and walk down a long hallway. She remembers one particularly rude aide. On her last trip, there was urine on the seat and no toilet paper. She called her husband in tears. The hospital\u2019s patient-advocate representative was appalled and assured Walsh she wouldn\u2019t have to pay the remaining $785 of her deductible. Walsh hopes hospital staffers have learned an important lesson. \u201cI would have rather been treated well and paid my 800 bucks,\u201d she said.\u201d **_Like our Health & Wellness page on Facebook for more science news about the ins and outs of the human body and mind, essays and advice.

Can new technology change that? Content: Summer is upon us, and with it peak U.S. airline travel: this July, more than 80 million passengers will cross American skies. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But what\u2019s good for vacation relaxation is terrible for the environment. According to the WWF, airline travel is the fastest growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions, leaving trucking and coal-burning power plants in their wake. Already, the 3 billion flights each year produce about 5 percent of the world\u2019s output from all sources. **** Every round-trip commercial flight between New York and L.A. generates the equivalent of two tons of carbon dioxide per passenger, as much as the average Nepalese family generates in five years. A Prius would have to travel 10,500 miles to have the same carbon impact. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Yet even those who want, urgently, to fight global warming have been slow to deal with the impact of air travel. (Think of those high-profile do-gooders who flew 550 private jets to confab at Davos about carbon dioxide levels in January. The Environmental Protection Agency only just declared that air travel contributes to global warming and that it will begin regulating greenhouse emissions by carriers under the Clean Air Act. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Why, when car travel is perennially in the hot seat, has this issue gotten so little attention? We\u2019ve got electric cars, smaller cars, cars with great gas mileage. Why haven\u2019t we seen the same technological evolution with planes? The answer is that airplanes pose a fundamentally different engineering problem. They have to do work to carry their fuel through the air, so are limited by the energy density of the storage medium. Increasing efficiency of aircraft engines and wings will help, but only to a point. And a lot of the \u201ceasy\u201d fixes have been made. Companies like Boeing and Airbus have been working for five decades to build planes that burn less fuel, innovating materials and making computer-aided tweaks to aerodynamic design. They\u2019ve increased use of strong, lightweight materials like carbon fiber laminates that now make up more than 50 percent of a modern passenger jet\u2019s airframe. They also developed sophisticated turbofan engines that are significantly more efficient than older models. Their newest aircraft (released in 2000) use half as much fuel per mile as the jets of a half-century ago (Cars and SUVs are about 40 percent more efficient today.) And engineers say there are few fixes left. \u201cThe present technology is already highly optimized,\u201d says writer and aircraft designer Peter Garrison. \u201cThe low-hanging fruit has been plucked.\u201d An alternative idea would be to write off conventional technology as a dead- end, and instead invest in radical approaches like solar-powered aircraft. The topic has been in the news lately, thanks to the photovoltaic-encrusted experimental plane Solar Impulse. The plane, currently in Japan, is part of a 12-year project by Swiss adventurers Bertrand Piccard and Andr\u00e9 Borschberg, who want to fly around the world. If successful, the plane is expected to return to its starting point in Abu Dhabi in August. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico If you squint, it\u2019s easy to see in Solar Impulse the dawn of the eco-friendly airliner. With four engines and wings as broad as a 747\u2019s, it physically resembles a commercial aircraft. But appearances deceive. To achieve its long-distance flights, Sunseeker not only uses advanced materials and design techniques, it also relies on extreme design choices. It is extremely light: At just 5,000 pounds, the 70-foot-long aircraft weighs less than a Chevy Avalanche. A fully laden 737, on the small side for a commercial jet, weighs about 150,000 lb or 30 times more than Solar Impulse. In order to carry the additional weight of passengers and their baggage, a commercial airliner built using the same technology would have to be impractically enormous. It would also be bare of all familiar amenities. To save energy, Solar Impulse is neither pressurized nor climate controlled, so that temperatures in the tiny cockpit swing between 86 F and -4 F. And it is slow. Solar Impulse cruises at a languid 56 mph, about one-tenth the speed of a typical commercial jet. The reason is simple aerodynamics. As it flies, a plane disrupts the air it moves through, and this takes power. The faster it goes, the more power it will consume. Very efficient airplanes, like gliders or human-powered airplanes, have long, thin wings designed to move slowly through the air. That\u2019s appealing for aeronautical engineers, but not to travelers on tight schedules. To get from Hawaii to Arizona for the eighth stage of its round-the-world journey Solar Impulse will require more than four days of continuous flight. Really, the only way for commercial aviation to become green would be for science to come up with a storage medium that\u2019s as energy dense as fossil fuel, but that doesn\u2019t release net carbon into the atmosphere. Someday, our descendants may find out a way to build super-batteries that can be charged using renewable energy sources or nuclear power. At present, however, the only technology that fits the bill is bio fuel: a hydrocarbon energy source that we make in the here-and-now, whether from crops or from recycled cooking oil and animal fats. Last year, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Embraer teamed up to open a biofuel research center in Brazil that will promote the development of sustainable aviation fuel. In December, Boeing carried out the first test flight of a 787 Dreamliner using \u201cgreen diesel.\u201d So far, this kind effort represents baby steps: the Dreamliner flight used just a 15 percent blend of green diesel with 85 percent conventionally derived fuel, and that only in one of its two engines. One problem with using higher percentages than that is that biofuel tends to freeze at typical airliner cruising altitudes. It\u2019s also more difficult to store, and can damage engine parts. We\u2019re a long way from running the world airline fleet on the stuff. So as you sling your beach duffel into the overhead bin in the summer, know that your fun in the sun this year will unavoidably play a role in making next\u2019s years summer even summerier. If you want to minimize your carbon footprint, there\u2019s really only one option. Just ask Slate writer Eric Holthaus. He\u2019s come up with an effective strategy \u2014 one that allowed him, he writes, to go \u201cfrom having more than double the carbon footprint as the average American to about 30 percent less than average.\u201d His trick? He gave up his 75,000-mile-a-year travel habit cold turkey. \u201cThis has to be the last flight I ever take,\u201d he tweeted as he boarded a plane last year. \u201cI\u2019m committing right now to stop flying.\u201d", "Title: Aviation is about to get its next Charles Lindbergh moment Content: In early May, two solar aviation pioneers at Solar Impulse are going to attempt what has never been done before \u2014 a coast-to-coast flight across America, from San Francisco to Washington (and then on to New York), powered only by sunlight. *[WSU]: Wayne State University They will not expend an ounce of fuel during the entire journey, and will be able to fly at both day and night, when the disappearing sun will effectively turn the one-seat plane covered with 12,000 solar cells into a subzero refrigerator.

Aircraft powered by alternative energy sources\u2014such as solar energy\u2014are a classic type of disruptive innovation in that they appear only on the low-end before the benefits in price and performance push the innovation higher up the value chain. Increases in solar performance over time could lead to even larger airplanes carrying more passengers at faster speeds over longer distances. Eventually, you may be able to book a flight on a solar-powered commercial airline.

After two months of setbacks, delay and dismay, the team aiming to accomplish the first ever solar-powered plane trip around the world wanted to start its longest and most difficult leg in secret. If they had to turn back yet again, Solar Impulse co-founder and pilot Bertrand Piccard explained in a video interview (he\u2019s not flying this leg), the team didn\u2019t want to disappoint their fans, or the news media. Better to take off from Japan and see what happens before making the flight public. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So they waited. And waited. And Monday morning, 10 hours after takeoff, Piccard\u2019s fellow pilot and founder Andre Borschberg tweeted an image from the air: the plane\u2019s wing silhouetted against the sunrise, pointing forward. \u201cVery strong emotions as I passed the point of no return: exploration starts here,\u201d he wrote. This is the project\u2019s the moment of truth, Piccard elaborated from the ground. Either Solar Impulse 2 makes it to Hawaii, or it doesn\u2019t make it at all. [ _Meet Solar Impulse 2, the solar-powered plane that never has to land_ ] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The five-day flight from Nagoya Airfield in Japan to Kalaeloa, Hawaii will be the ultimate test of Piccard and Borschberg\u2019s project, conceived more than a decade ago. If it\u2019s successful, the trip will be the longest ever made by crewed plane running entirely on solar power. The team is depending on 120 hours of good weather, good light and good luck to keep the tiny aircraft aloft. Solar Impulse has no fuel on board, other than the energy from the sun stored up in its batteries. But they believe it\u2019ll be enough to carry the plane through the five nights it\u2019ll take to get to the next runway. Borschberg is ready if it\u2019s not. He\u2019s equipped with a dinghy, enough supplies to last him several days, and the training to bail out of a failing aircraft. But neither he nor his partner is the type to dwell long on negative possibilities. Especially not Piccard, the grandson of a famed physicist and balloonist and the son of the undersea explorer Jaques Piccard. If nature didn\u2019t incline him toward this type of quixotic quest, nurture certainly did. Piccard said in 2013 that his household growing up was brimming with heady tales of discovery and discussions of mankind\u2019s endless potential for progress. He didn\u2019t realize there was any other way to look at a problem except as a possibility. \u201cAll the most incredible things seemed to be completely normal,\u201d Piccard told an audience at the NASA Ames Research Center in California, according to the New York Times. \u201cI thought this was the normal way to live and I was very disappointed to see that there are a lot of people who are afraid of the unknown, afraid of the doubts, afraid of the question marks.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In 1999, he and fellow aeronaut Brian Jones became the first people to complete a nonstop trip around globe in a balloon. But that journey was nearly cut short by a propane shortage. For the sake of exploration, and the environment, Piccard began dreaming of a way to fly without fuel. He and Jones launched a feasibility study in 2001 at the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale in Lausanne, Switzerland, bringing Swiss Air Force pilot and entrepreneur Borschberg on board as manager. They publicly launched the project two years later and began work on a prototype in 2003. Their original model, Solar Impulse 1, made its first flight in 2009 \u2014 a 350-meter \u201cflea hop\u201d that took it just one meter above the runway in D\u00fcbendorf, Switzerland. It was not the first time a solar-powered plane had ever left the ground, but it was the first time that a plane with the potential to fly through the night had done so. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[First leg completed in bid to pilot solar-powered plane around globe]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Solar Impulse 2, the plane attempting this year\u2019s round-the-world trip, is loaded with nearly 50 percent more solar cells than its predecessor but is incredibly lightweight. Though it has roughly the same wingspan as an Airbus A380, the world\u2019s largest commercial aircraft currently in service, it\u2019s less than 1 percent of the Airbus\u2019s weight \u2014 even when the A380 isn\u2019t carrying passengers. So long as the sunlight holds, the tiny plane could feasibly fly around the world forever. Really, Piccard jokes during speeches, the only thing that isn\u2019t sustainable about Solar Impulse 2 is its pilot. The telephone booth-sized cockpit fits only one person, and humans \u2014 unlike the plane \u2014 can only fly through the night for so long. That\u2019s part of the reason that this round-the-world trip is being undertaken in stages, with Piccard and Borschberg alternating time at the controls. The Nagoya to Hawaii trip is leg eight of a 13-part journey that began in Abu Dhabi in March. The numerous stops allow the pilots to trade off, gives crews a chance to inspect and repair the craft and provides an opportunity for Piccard and Borschberg to evangelize about clean, renewable technology. Their project is sponsored by Masdar, an Abu Dhabi clean-energy company; Omega; Google and Mo\u00ebt Hennessey, among others. The month-long layover in Japan was unplanned; Borschberg had originally intended to make the six-day flight from Nanjing, China to Kalaeloa in one go. But bad weather in early June grounded the plane, and a second flight attempt later in the month was cancelled because of concerns about weather conditions. Even Borschberg and Piccard began expressing doubts about their ability to complete the journey. \u201cIf we cannot finish this year, we will finish next year,\u201d Borschberg told CNN on June 19. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Finally this week the 150 meteorologists, flight experts and engineers behind the project found the right five-day weather window to set off on the plane\u2019s riskiest flight yet. Now Solar Impulse 2 moves noiselessly through the air at a modest 28 miles per hour, rising to 28,000 feet during the day to catch the sun\u2019s rays, and sinking to just 5,000 above the ocean while flying at night. There\u2019s no room in the tiny cockpit for standing or moving around \u2014 the toilet is simply a hole beneath a cushion on the pilot\u2019s seat. But Borschberg needs to keep his eyes on the controls. The lightweight plane responds to the slightest changes in weather and wind, meaning he must be constantly alert. He and Piccard trained themselves to sleep for a mere 20 minutes at a time, 12 times a day. During flight they wear goggles that flash lights to wake them up, and armbands beneath their flight suit will buzz if the plane isn\u2019t flying straight. In a livestream of the flight available on the Solar Impulse web Site Monday, sunlight poured through a window into the plane, glinting off the equipment and the thin plastic coils of Borschberg\u2019s oxygen mask tubes. The rhythmic scratch of his breathing was the only sound coming from the cockpit. He was just 13 hours into the 120 journey, with nothing but open ocean beneath him and no place to land should anything go wrong. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cIt was really a jump in the unknown,\u201d Piccard said in the video interview. \u201c\u2026 Until now we have been in a protected environment, in controlled airspace, with our references, with all our benchmarks. And here we lose everything at once.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That made the decision to take off difficult for the rest of the Solar Impulse team, Piccard explained. They almost didn\u2019t let Borschberg fly out into that risky unknown. But in his final Twitter dispatch before takeoff, Borschberg was determinedly optimistic about the endeavor. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cAll scientific breakthroughs start with a crazy idea and are first said to be impossible,\u201d it read.", "Title: This car may soon be the world\u2019s first street-legal vehicle powered by the sun Content: Hayden Smith and his racing team are euphoric.

Once certified, the Sunswift eVe, built by students hailing from Australia\u2019s University of New South Wales will reign as the fastest electric car to cover 500 kilometers (310 miles). More importantly, the achievement brings it one step closer towards becoming the world\u2019s first street-legal solar-powered car. The eVe debuted last year at the biannual World Solar Challenge, an event where scores of automotive engineers \u2014 hailing from some of the finest research institutions around \u2014 take part in a grueling long-distance race through the heart of the Outback. As the premier spectacle in solar-powered motor racing, the cross-country course runs from Darwin, located at the top of the continent, all the way down to Adelaide at the southern tip, a total distance of 1,877 miles. Since the inaugural race in 1987, the gathering has also given rise to a number of impressive achievements. For instance, the Sunswift team, a longtime participant, built an earlier model that, at an average speed of 55 mph, holds the title of fastest solar-powered vehicle. But even at a glance, it\u2019s easy to see why many say the technology still has a ways to go before making the grade as a serviceable means of transport. With wide, flat tablet-shaped frames, they\u2019re more reminiscent of a giant tic-tac on bicycle wheels than anything resembling conventional automobiles. The driver\u2019s cockpit, meanwhile, is little more than oval pod that starts to feel cramped, just by looking at it. This approach, however, allows teams to reduce weight and drag through aerodynamics while expanding the amount of surface area that can be decked out with solar cells. In essence, the event has become more of showcase for entries more akin to drivable solar panels than actual cars. All that changed last year with the addition of a separate \u201ccruiser class\u201d division to accommodate vehicles conceived in the mold of family-style sedans and two-seaters. The idea had been partly inspired by one team\u2019s audacious decision to show up at an event in 2009 with a peculiar entry called the BOcruiser. The car, designed by students from the Bochum University of Applied Sciences in Germany, was rather slow compared to the rest. But it stirred up intrigue amongst on-lookers with a classic four-wheel chassis, ample passenger room and a look nearly indistinguishable from that of a Volkswagen Beetle. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t even arrive on time, but that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d professor Friedbert Pautzke, of Bochum University of Applied Sciences told the German publication Deutsche Welle at the time. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really interested in is demonstrating that people can use these rather normal-looking cars to drive across Australia.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Much has been made of the foreseeable feasibility of bringing a \u201cpractical\u201d solar-powered commuter vehicle to the masses. A few years back, Japanese manufacturer Toyota Motors took a crack at integrating solar into its Prius model when they gave buyers the option of an energy-harvesting roof package that generated just enough power to run a ventilation fan during hot days. At the time, the deluxe package, costing $2,000 to $4,000, went on to become somewhat of a subject of ridicule, with detractors pointing out how the net boost from solar cells was so paltry, it simply wouldn\u2019t justify the expense. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday In 2012, William F. Banholzer, a chemical engineer and former executive vice president and chief technology officer at the Dow Chemical Company, penned an editorial in Forbes that cited the solar-powered Prius as a classic example as to why a solar-powered car \u201cisn\u2019t practical\u201d and \u201cnever will be.\u201d He wrote: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday In a way, the eVe can be thought of as an ambitious follow-up to the German team\u2019s initial efforts to prove that the very notion of a self-powered car can actually make a lot of sense in the real world. Besides standard seating for two, accompanied by front and side windows, the exterior is comprised of a NASCAR-inspired carbon fiber body that weighs only 661 pounds. Meanwhile, under the hood is a 132-pound Lithium-ion battery, which transfers power to a pair of DC motors installed within the hubs of the rear wheels, a setup that allows for a stated efficiency of 97 percent. \u201cWe take no prisoners when it comes to making sure the car is as efficient as possible,\u201d Smith says. \u201cEverything from the curves in the vehicle, to the tape we use, to the items we have in the car, is designed to keep it as efficient as possible.\u201d For the record-breaking feat, the car was brought to a racetrack in the southern Australian city of Victoria. The on-board solar panels were turned off for the duration of the run to showcase its capacity for extreme endurance and efficiency. At the course\u2019s end, the team would discover that the driver was able to maintain an average speed of 66 mph, eclipsing the previous speed record of 45 mph by a wide margin. \u201cBest of all,\u201d Smith added, \u201cwe just broke a world record using lower operational power consumption than your typical four-slice toaster.\u201d To put this in perspective, the eVe consumes less than a third of the electricity at 20 kilowatt-hours when traveling at a cruising speed of 66 mph than the Tesla Model S, which uses fuel at a rate of 67 kilowatt-hours as it moves at a lower speed of 55 mph, according to Smith\u2019s calculations. The caveat, which should be noted, is that the race car isn\u2019t loaded with the kind of standard options that make production models heavier, and consequently, less efficient. After the victory lap, Smith was sanguine. He feels that the hastening pace of technological advancement, while still having a ways to go, will soon make it possible for photovoltaic cells to serve as a viable range extender as cars become more efficient. Take, for instance, the solar panels on the eVe, which are capable of providing an estimated daily peak power net gain of approximately 800 watts. On a sunny day, this translates to an additional 300 kilometers (186 miles) on top of the car\u2019s 500 kilometer per-charge range. \u201cA lot of people drive 30-60 minutes to work each day and park in the sun,\u201d he explained. \u201cUsing eVe to commute would mean that, on most days, people would never have to recharge.\u201d Another encouraging sign for the technology may come from the Ford Motor Company, which announced earlier this year that they\u2019ve been prototyping an electric car with a unique rooftop PV system that they claim is capable of providing, on good days, an extra 8 kilowatts of power, roughly the equivalent to four hours of plugged-in charging. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday To meet the criteria for road registration by 2015, the Sunswift team plans to carry out a series of minor modifications like installing headlights, raising the vehicle\u2019s height and remodeling the interior. This includes, among other enhancements, adding dashboards, drink holders, a better steering wheel, de-misters, and a wider range of controls for the driver. \u201cLooking ahead, we\u2019re going to focus on working on refinements like ergonomics, comfort, and convenience,\u201d Smith says. \u201cWe want the drivers and passengers to feel like they\u2019re in a real car.\u201d"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the environmental impact of air travel and the slow progress in dealing with it.

But they decided to make their next home one that can accommodate their future needs better than their Falls Church townhouse-style condo, which has multiple flights of stairs. \u201cWe bought the Waverly model, a villa-style home at Stone Ridge by Van Metre Homes that has a first-floor bedroom with a full bath that we can use someday if we need to,\u201d says Healy. \u201cThere\u2019s only one staircase to the upper level and it\u2019s straight, so we could even add one of those stair lifts if we ever needed one.\u201d Unlike many empty nesters, Healy and Leonov upsized rather than downsized in their move to Loudoun County, but it was the open floor plan, the natural light and the option for one-level living in the future that attracted them. Baby boomers, who drove the first-time buyer market in the Washington area in the mid-to-late 1980s and the move-up market in the early 2000s, were the largest segment of home buyers in 2013. \u201cA major trend in the metro area last year was the number of non-family buyers,\u201d says Dan Fulton, senior vice president at John Burns Real Estate Consulting (JBREC) in Reston, Va. \u201cThe group we call mature couples, who are 45 and older without any kids age 18 and younger at home, represented the biggest group of buyers, with 23 percent of the market share or more than 19,525 home sales.\u201d \u201cMature singles\u201d \u2014 over 45 with no children \u2014 accounted for 12 percent of sales last year, and retirees over 65 represented 10 percent; combined with mature couples, these groups of buyers made up 45 percent of buyers in the District region in 2013. \u201cNever-nesters\u201d \u2014 JBREC\u2019s term for those without children \u2014 are beginning to look for a new type of home, typically with less maintenance, the option of one-level living with a first-floor bedroom or rambler-style home on one level, or an apartment-style condominium. Some empty nesters opt for an active adult community that\u2019s age-restricted to buyers 55 and older, but others are simply looking to downsize and to live in walkable communities. \u201cA common theme among mature couples and younger people without kids is to live within walking distance to shops and restaurants or public transportation,\u201d Fulton says. \u201cBuyers who make this lifestyle choice often choose location over size and are willing to pay a lot to be near a place like Reston Town Center.\u201d David Versel, a senior research associate with the George Mason University Center for Regional Analysis in Arlington, Va., says his studies are showing that while baby boomers prefer walkability, most are concentrated in the suburbs where they face the need to drive. GMU\u2019s research shows that 47 percent of homeowner households in the D.C. area in 2010 had at least one baby boomer owner (aged 45 to 64). \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of inertia among baby boomers, which we think is contributing to the low inventory of homes on the market,\u201d Versel says. \u201cThe biggest obstacle to getting baby boomers to move is the lack of the right types of housing. We have the push factor in place; boomers think their homes are too big, they don\u2019t want to climb stairs, or they want to drive less. But we don\u2019t have the pull factor of the type of home they\u2019re looking for. They can sell their house for $700,000, but they can\u2019t find an attractive housing type in a desirable area that\u2019s also affordable.\u201d Diana Keeling, a realty agent with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Bethesda, Md., not only works with many empty nesters looking to downsize, but she also is one. She and her husband, Nick Keeling, recently bought a one-level rambler in the Bannockburn section of Bethesda, an area where they\u2019ve lived since 1983. \u201cWe wanted to stay in the neighborhood, so we found this house and completely gutted the inside and turned it into a beautiful contemporary home,\u201d Keeling says. \u201cMost of my buyers in their 50s and 60s want to live somewhere where they can walk to things. They think they want a condo, but condos often turn out to be too expensive, especially if they want three bedrooms. There just aren\u2019t very many available, especially in Bethesda, so they can cost nearly $2 million.\u201d Keeling says some of her clients opt to stay where they are and wait, or they move to smaller homes but without first-level master suites. She says some buy townhouses and have elevators installed, but that can be a costly option and isn\u2019t always possible. \u201cA few buyers have just decided to wait until they\u2019re ready to move into an age-restricted community,\u201d Keeling says. \u201cSome people are moving into places like Fox Hill in Bethesda earlier because they have bigger condos, and that way they don\u2019t have to move again.\u201d Homeowners in their 50s and 60s often want to move out of their detached single-family homes and into condos so they don\u2019t have to do home maintenance, says Kevin Love, a real estate agent with Re/Max Allegiance in Arlington. These people also prefer to buy something newer and to avoid renovation projects, because they\u2019ve already experienced the pitfalls and stress of remodeling, he says. \u201cSome older buyers are looking at homes in the Gainesville area, where they have smaller detached houses and a golf course, but most want to stay in the area,\u201d Love says. \u201cIf they\u2019re in a single-family home in Arlington, they want to move to a condo in Arlington, and they\u2019ll compromise on the size or the age of the place in order to have less maintenance.\u201d Love says many of his buyers prefer to be in a mixed-age community rather than an active-adult community. \u201cThe trend seems to be to age in place, at least in the same Zip code, near friends and in a neighborhood they like,\u201d Love says. \u201cAlso, a lot of people are working longer, so they need to stay close to where they work.\u201d Fulton says that buyers who are interested in active-adult communities typically choose them for the lifestyle that includes recreational amenities and a grand clubhouse along with the social aspect of living near people of similar interests and ages. \u201cOutside of those communities, there aren\u2019t a lot of move-down homes available for empty nesters, so this is an opportunity for builders to introduce this,\u201d Fulton says. \u201cThe homes people are looking for don\u2019t exist much as resales in this market.\u201d Age-restricted developments such as Fox Hill in Bethesda are sprouting across the region, but a few builders also are designing for empty nesters in multi-age communities. At Willowsford in Loudoun County, Va., Arcadia Community, a company that started in California\u2019s Napa Valley, has introduced luxurious, single-story homes priced at $750,000 to more than $1 million. \u201cThese are big, single-level homes on three-fourths to 1.5-acre lots with a wide-open floor plan so you can see straight through from the front of the house to the back,\u201d says Brad Durga, chief operating officer for Arcadia Community in Leesburg, Va. \u201cThe bedrooms and kitchen and living areas are all on the main level, and then we have what we call a club level downstairs that\u2019s open to the main level with a wide staircase. . . . You can also add an elevator to each home.\u201d The houses have 3,000 to 6,700 finished square feet, so they\u2019re not meant for downsizing. Durga says the houses are popular with other buyers in addition to empty nesters because they\u2019re designed to be a better match for the way people live today. Van Metre Homes has several new designs geared to empty nesters, including detached single-family homes, villas and condos in a building with an elevator in the active-adult Villages community at Broadlands in Ashburn, Va. \u201cOur Vista collection of homes sold out at Raspberry Falls, and now we\u2019re selling them at Bull Run Golf Club in Haymarket,\u201d says Merle Phillips, vice president of sales and marketing at Van Metre Homes in Stone Ridge, Va. \u201cThe one-level homes have a big owner\u2019s suite . . . plus two more bedrooms on the main level.\u201d At Bull Run Golf Club, the houses start in the $700,000s. The condos at the Villages, priced in the $300,000s, offer walkability since they\u2019re across the street from the Broadlands Marketplace. At Brambleton, Van Metre Homes offers an optional first-floor master bedroom in its attached villa models, priced in the $400,000s. Phillips says these flexible floor plans appeal to empty nesters and others. The company also offers single-family homes with first-floor bedrooms and baths at Belmont Glen, Brambleton and Stone Ridge. Those are priced in the $500,000s. \u201cWe asked our sales team for comments from potential buyers and found that even when people didn\u2019t have multiple generations living with them year-round, they liked the idea of having a first-floor bedroom for extended visitors or in case they need it in the future,\u201d Phillips says. Fulton says that the existing homes in the D.C. area are geared to families with children, so he expects that builders will begin to focus on designing and developing new homes for empty nesters. \u201cThere will always be a market for family oriented new homes,\u201d Fulton says, \u201cbut builders are competing with existing homes for families. They\u2019ll face less competition when they build homes that match what empty nesters want.\u201d **Michele Lerner** is a freelance writer. \u25cfWalkability to restaurants, shops, public transportation \u2014 in the city or an inner suburb or in a community with a town center. \u25cfOne-level living \u2014 or an elevator. \u25cfBig windows that let in lots of natural light. \u25cfLess space \u2014 but lots of storage. \u25cfOpen floor plan with fewer formal spaces. \u25cfStairs \u2014 a two-level home is acceptable as long as the master suite is on the first floor. \u25cfRoutine home maintenance requirements such as shoveling snow, cutting grass and cleaning gutters. \u25cf A lot of space \u2014 too many rooms means more cleaning and more maintenance. \u25cf Location where they have to drive everywhere. \u25cf Older homes that need remodeling \u2014 empty nesters prefer a new or already renovated home rather than working on a place themselves.", "Title: Some aging Baby Boomers will upsize, not downsize, if they move at all, poll finds Content: We\u2019ve been warned that the multi-level homes with the sprawling lawns in the driving-dependent suburbs that are popular with baby boomers may not work so well for them as they age. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies and the AARP told us so in a report released last month, which concluded that today\u2019s homes generally lack the features that these aging boomers will need \u2014 such as extra-wide hallways and easy-to-reach light switches and door knobs. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Now, a survey by The Demand Institute suggests Baby Boomers simply don\u2019t care. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The nonprofit group, run by the Conference Board and Nielsen, polled nearly 4,000 Baby Boomer households (ages 50 to 69) last year about their future housing plans. It found that this generation won\u2019t \u201cstick to the script.\u201d Most of them don\u2019t plan to move, and if they do, they don\u2019t necessarily plan to downsize. As for mortgage debt, they\u2019ve still got it and they still see no problem with taking out a mortgage to finance the next home. **** In fact, they\u2019re confident they can qualify for a new one even though it\u2019s still tough to get a mortgage these days. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cThis survey simply reflects what people are telling us their plans are,\u201d said Jeremy Burbank, vice president at The Demand Institute. \u201cIn some cases, they\u2019re planning ahead and being realistic, and in other cases, they\u2019re not.\u201d Here are some of the poll results, which were released Thursday. **Most Baby Boomers plan to age in place.** The majority of them have lived in their homes for at least a decade, and when they retire, they plan to stay put. Some will be forced to stay due to personal circumstances, such as financial hardship. But most prefer to age-in-place if given a choice. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **For those who plan to renovate, age-friendly features are not a top priority.** Three-quarters of the people polled suffered from a chronic condition or had experienced a major health problem. Yet 40 percent of boomers plan to tackle a major home renovation in the next three years, and they aren\u2019t itching for handrails and such. Their wants are more closely aligned with those of the younger set. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Nearly half of Baby Boomers who plan move don\u2019t want to downsize.** Only 37 percent of those polled said they want to move. But a good chunk of them don\u2019t plan to scrimp on size or space. More than half of Baby Boomers (58 percent) said they want at least the same size home they have now, if not bigger, when they move. About 48 percent said they plan to spend the same amount or more when buying their next home. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **They want bigger and better.** Those who want pricier or larger homes are the \u201cupsizers.\u201d About 46 percent of Baby Boomers fall into that category. But they\u2019re not necessarily the most affluent of the generation. Rather, they\u2019re the people who put off buying their dream home when the economic downturn hit. Some of them rent, and now want to own. But when they make the jump, they\u2019re not going to spend lavishly. The median price of their next home will be $180,000. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **The \u201cdownsizers\u201d are the more affluent.** They are the Baby Boomers who\u2019ve been there, done that. They\u2019ve lived in pricey, large homes (about 2,000 square feet on average) and they want a smaller home or one that\u2019s less expensive than the one they\u2019re in. About 54 percent of Baby Boomers are identified as downsizers. The median price for the next home they purchase will be higher than for \u201cupsizers\u201d \u2014 about $200,000 versus $180,000. This is clearly the wealthier subset of the Boomer generation. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **City Life? Warmer climate? No way.** The Harvard/AARP study established that the vast majority of older adults live in single family homes in the suburbs. This survey found that Baby Boomers who plan to move won\u2019t go far. \u201cThere\u2019s no shift to or from the suburb or the city,\u201d Burbank said. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard that the suburbs are going to get greyer, and we see that reflected in our research.\u201d Only one-third of the older adults polled plan to move out of state. More than half will move within 30 miles of their current home. Very few (one in five) see senior-related housing or active adult communities in their future. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **They still want to live in single-family homes, but also single-story.** This generation still resists condominium life. Most Baby Boomers want to own a single-family home, though they\u2019d prefer it be one-story. \u201cSingle story is a practical decision, but they\u2019re not sacrificing style or other aspirations,\u201d like a yard or garden, Burbank said. More than two-thirds of them still want that. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **And the debt keeps piling up.** Citing data from a Federal Reserve survey, the Demand Institute said Baby Boomers are more laden with mortgage debt than earlier generations at the same stage of life. The median outstanding balance on their mortgages has shot up 142 percent since 1992. The Boomers watched their wealth grow until the recession hit. \u201cJust as they were expecting their wealth to accelerate, that\u2019s when things took a u-turn,\u201d Burbank said. If all had stayed on the pre-2008 track, the net worth of the typical Boomer household would be about 2.5 times what it is today. Still, Boomers who plan to move will account for $1 of every $4 spent on buying or renting homes in the next five years, when most of them will be retired. Half their assets are tied up in their homes. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Factories to baby boomers: Please keep working! Content: Minnesota-based Ultra Machining Co. has been around for more than 45 years and performs precision manufacturing and engineering services for the medical, aerospace, and other industries. Business is doing well but with growth comes challenges. Like many manufacturers around the country, this family-owned firm is challenged with finding experienced people to perform the kind of specialized work so valued by their customers. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, the industry will need 3.5 million more factory workers over and above what exists today. Many of my clients worry about where they will all come from. For now, management at Ultra Machining\u2019s strategy is simple, and growing in popularity: keep the older people working. Although millennials (those aged 18-34) make up almost half of the U.S. workforce, most manufacturers are still very reliant on baby boomers. Research shows that 27 percent of manufacturing workers are over the age of 55. Keeping those baby boomers productive is becoming a big priority nowadays for manufacturers of all sizes and who can blame them? Boomers have experience and knowledge. They tend to be loyal. Best of all, many want to work. And companies are happy to comply. About 19 percent of factory employers like Ultra Machining \u201cfloat the idea\u201d of phased-in retirements, according to the Society for Human Resources Management\u2013an increase of six percent from just four years ago. To meet the needs of the older generation, manufacturers are offering flexible schedules, reduced work weeks, job sharing, mentoring or consulting. Some companies are even retrofitting their shop floors to move materials to more reachable places so that there\u2019s less wear and tear on those geriatric knees and backs. A number of trucking firms have even made ergonomic changes to truck cabs so desperately needed drivers are comfortable and stick around, Jacquelyn James, a co-director at Boston College\u2019s Sloan Center on Aging & Work, told the Star Tribune. Finding good people to help your company grow is a huge challenge this year. Like some manufacturers, maybe a few of those 78 million baby boomers nearing retirement could be your solution to that problem.", "Title: Mapped: The oldest and youngest states in America Content: A few generations ago, most people lived out their lives in the places where they were born. Today, Americans are used to moving, often due to the pull of economic opportunity. Teenagers move across the country to go to college, 20- and 30-somethings flock to cities for jobs, and white-haired \"snow birds\" head to Florida or Arizona to escape the winter. So it makes sense that the population of different parts of the United States varies by age. Jishai Evers of Dadaviz has created a series of maps using U.S. Census data from the American FactFinder showing just what these differences look like. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Evers doesn't use the term \"Millennial,\" which commonly refers to the generation that came of age around the year 2000. Instead, he splits up America into the Greatest Generation (now 70 and above), Baby Boomers (50 to 69), Generation X (30 to 49), Generation Y (15 to 29) and Generation Z (0 to 14 years old). The animation below shows where different generations are concentrated by state. It probably won't surprise you that Florida has the largest Greatest Generation population. Arizona, Maine, Pennsylvania and West Virginia are also popular with the oldest Americans. Baby Boomers are spread more evenly around the country, but they show up more prominently in New England and Montana. Gen Xers appear to have sought out jobs in bigger cities, with a stronger presence in New York, Minnesota, Illinois, Texas, Colorado and the West Coast. Gen Yers and Gen Zers, who are under 30, especially show up in faster-growing states like North Dakota, Utah and California. The next map shows the largest generation by state. Gen Xers dominated in most states, including across the West and South. But Baby Boomers outnumber them in New England, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota, among others. Gen Yers are the biggest population in only one state, North Dakota. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the different populations by state. Utah has the most Gen Zers (0 to 14), while the District of Columbia (which is not actually a state) has the least. This map shows how generations break down at the county level. Again, you can see the concentration of older people in Florida and Arizona, among other places. Lots of urban areas, including Seattle, Chicago and D.C., appear big with Gen Xers. Finally, here's a static image of the most numerous generation by county. Baby Boomers still dominate much of the map, but Gen Xers are gradually taking over. _You might also like:_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico -How railroads, highways and other man-made lines racially divide America\u2019s cities *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico -The best places to be alone all over the world *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico -The college majors that are most likely to marry each other *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: How millennial homeowners are changing the look of kitchens Content: As millennials join the ranks of homeowners, they\u2019re making their mark on how those homes look, and in some cases bucking long-held preferences. Here are some of the trends popping up among the newest generation of homeowners found in Houzz\u2019s 2017 Kitchen Trends Study. Of the survey\u2019s 2,700 par\u00adticipants (all of whom had recently completed a kitchen remodel project or were in the process of doing so), between 10 and 12 percent were ages 25 to 34. \u201cMillennials are a lot more focused on making sure that the style, color palette and materials used in the major elements of the kitchen stay as relevant as long as possible because they\u2019re not planning another remodel any time soon,\u201d said Nino Sitchinava, Houzz\u2019s principal economist. Although gray was the most popular wall color across all ages (and up in popularity 4 percent from 2015), it was especially popular among millennial homeowners (43 percent of millennials vs. 22 percent of baby boomers chose it). Boomers, on the other hand, were more likely to try warmer colors, and 1 in 10 chose green walls. White cabinets topped all age groups, but millennials were nearly twice as likely to extend that color to the backsplash as well. Younger renovators tended to prefer decorative pendant lighting (67 percent), while older homeowners were more likely to choose more functional under- or in-cabinet lights (74 percent). \u201cThere\u2019s potentially a little more versatility with pendant lighting,\u201d Sitchinava said. \u201cIt\u2019s self- contained [and] a little more affordable. But some of it could also be preferences and style aesthetic.\u201d Lighting upgrades were part of 84 percent of the kitchen renovations surveyed. The most popular built-in features for millennials were pantry cabinets and islands, appearing in 2 of 5 renovated kitchens, and younger homeowners were much more likely to install an island than older homeowners (49 percent vs. 36 percent, respectively). \u201cThey are a must-have in a millennial kitchen,\u201d Sitchinava said. \u201cMillennials really do value that extra counter space.\u201d Although contemporary is the most popular style for kitchen remodels across all ages (26 percent among millennials and 24 percent among baby boomers), younger homeowners are more likely to try a modern (19 percent) or farmhouse style (14 percent) for their renovation as opposed to boomers, who are more likely to stick with a traditional style (14 percent compared with 8 percent of millennials). Millennial homeowners \u201care twice as likely to be driven by cost considerations than homeowners over age 35,\u201d per the survey\u2019s findings. Younger renovators are also more willing to get to their hands dirty when it comes to kitchen remodeling, with a majority favoring stock and ready-to-assemble cabinets. \u201cThey are less likely to hire a general contractor, architect or a designer and instead take on that process themselves,\u201d Sitchinava said. Still, about a third of the millennials surveyed splurged on custom cabinetry (vs. 42 percent of baby boomers). \u201cMillennials are going into their kitchen remodel with a sort of understanding that they want to make the kitchen as perfect as they possibly can,\u201d Sitchinava said, \u201cbecause they are going to be utilizing it for a long time.\u201d Look and feel (72 percent), and durability (53 percent) were the driving factors for choosing a countertop material, far ahead of cost (21 percent), and quartz and granite reign supreme as the most sought-after materials, across all ages. However, Gen Y is much more willing to experiment with an alternative, more budget-friendly countertop material, such as laminate or wood. **More fromLifestyle:** Top-tier bar carts for budgets big and small Restoring cabinet veneer may take more than elbow grease Renovating your home?

Content: Justice Department officials have known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people, but prosecutors failed to notify defendants or their attorneys even in many cases they knew were troubled. Officials started reviewing the cases in the 1990s after reports that sloppy work by examiners at the FBI lab was producing unreliable forensic evidence in court trials. Instead of releasing those findings, they made them available only to the prosecutors in the affected cases, according to documents and interviews with dozens of officials. In addition, the Justice Department reviewed only a limited number of cases and focused on the work of one scientist at the FBI lab, despite warnings that problems were far more widespread and could affect potentially thousands of cases in federal, state and local courts. As a result, hundreds of defendants nationwide remain in prison or on parole for crimes that might merit exoneration, a retrial or a retesting of evidence using DNA because FBI hair and fiber experts may have misidentified them as suspects. In one Texas case, Benjamin Herbert Boyle was executed in 1997, more than a year after the Justice Department began its review. Boyle would not have been eligible for the death penalty without the FBI\u2019s flawed work, according to a prosecutor\u2019s memo. The case of a Maryland man serving a life sentence for a 1981 double killing is another in which federal and local law enforcement officials knew of forensic problems but never told the defendant. Attorneys for the man, John Norman Huffington, say they learned of potentially exculpatory Justice Department findings from The Washington Post. They are seeking a new trial. Justice Department officials said that they met their legal and constitutional obligations when they learned of specific errors, that they alerted prosecutors and were not required to inform defendants directly. The review was performed by a task force created during an inspector general\u2019s investigation of misconduct at the FBI crime lab in the 1990s. The inquiry took nine years, ending in 2004, records show, but the findings were never made public. In the discipline of hair and fiber analysis, only the work of FBI Special Agent Michael P. Malone was questioned. Even though Justice Department and FBI officials knew that the discipline had weaknesses and that the lab lacked protocols \u2014 and learned that examiners\u2019 \u201cmatches\u201d were often wrong \u2014 they kept their reviews limited to Malone. But two cases in D.C. Superior Court show the inadequacy of the government\u2019s response. Santae A. Tribble, now 51, was convicted of killing a taxi driver in 1978, and Kirk L. Odom, now 49, was convicted of a sexual assault in 1981. Key evidence at each of their trials came from separate FBI experts \u2014 not Malone \u2014 who swore that their scientific analysis proved with near certainty that Tribble\u2019s and Odom\u2019s hair was at the respective crime scenes. But DNA testing this year on the hair and on other old evidence virtually eliminates Tribble as a suspect and completely clears Odom. Both men have completed their sentences and are on lifelong parole. They are now seeking exoneration in the courts in the hopes of getting on with their lives. Neither case was part of the Justice Department task force\u2019s review. A third D.C. case shows how the lack of Justice Department notification has forced people to stay in prison longer than they should have. Donald E. Gates, 60, served 28 years for the rape and murder of a Georgetown University student based on Malone\u2019s testimony that his hair was found on the victim\u2019s body. He was exonerated by DNA testing in 2009. But for 12 years before that, prosecutors never told him about the inspector general\u2019s report about Malone, that Malone\u2019s work was key to his conviction or that Malone\u2019s findings were flawed, leaving him in prison the entire time. After The Post contacted him about the forensic issues, U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. of the District said his office would try to review all convictions that used hair analysis. Seeking to learn whether others shared Gates\u2019s fate, The Post worked with the nonprofit National Whistleblowers Center, which had obtained dozens of boxes of task force documents through a years-long Freedom of Information Act fight. Task force documents identifying the scientific reviews of problem cases generally did not contain the names of the defendants. Piecing together case numbers and other bits of information from more than 10,000 pages of documents, The Post found more than 250 cases in which a scientific review was completed. Available records did not allow the identification of defendants in roughly 100 of those cases. Records of an unknown number of other questioned cases handled by federal prosecutors have yet to be released by the government. The Post found that while many prosecutors made swift and full disclosures, many others did so incompletely, years late or not at all. The effort was stymied at times by lack of cooperation from some prosecutors and declining interest and resources as time went on. Overall, calls to defense lawyers indicate and records documented that prosecutors disclosed the reviews\u2019 results to defendants in fewer than half of the 250-plus questioned cases. Michael R. Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor and the inspector general who investigated the FBI lab, said in a statement that even if more defense lawyers were notified of the initial review, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t absolve the task force from ensuring that every single defense lawyer in one of these cases was notified.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is deeply troubling that after going to so much time and trouble to identify problematic conduct by FBI forensic analysts the DOJ Task Force apparently failed to follow through and ensure that defense counsel were notified in every single case.\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said the federal review was an \u201cexhaustive effort\u201d and met legal requirements, and she referred questions about hair analysis to the FBI. The FBI said it would evaluate whether a nationwide review is needed. \u201cIn cases where microscopic hair exams conducted by the FBI resulted in a conviction, the FBI is evaluating whether additional review is warranted,\u201d spokeswoman Ann Todd said in a statement. \u201cThe FBI has undertaken comprehensive reviews in the past, and will not hesitate to do so again if necessary.\u201d John McCormick had just finished the night shift driving a taxi for Diamond Cab on July 26, 1978. McCormick, 63, reached the doorstep of his home in Southeast Washington about 3 a.m., when he was robbed and fatally shot by a man in a stocking mask, according to his widow, who caught a glimpse of the attack from inside the house. Police soon focused on Santae Tribble as a suspect. A police informant said Tribble told her he was with his childhood friend, Cleveland Wright, when Wright shot McCormick. After a three-day trial, jurors deliberated two hours before asking about a stocking found a block away at the end of an alley on 28th Street SE. It had been recovered by a police dog, and it contained a single hair that the FBI traced to Tribble. Forty minutes later, the jury found Tribble guilty of murder. He was sentenced in January 1980 to 20 years to life in prison. Tribble, 17 at the time, his brother, his girlfriend and a houseguest all testified that they were together preparing to celebrate the guest\u2019s birthday the night McCormick was killed. All four said Tribble and his girlfriend were asleep between 2 and 4:30 a.m. in Seat Pleasant. Tribble took the stand in his own defense, saying what he had said all along \u2014 that he had nothing to do with McCormick\u2019s killing. The prosecution began its closing argument by citing the FBI\u2019s testimony about the hair from the stocking. This January, after a year-long effort to have DNA evidence retested, Tribble\u2019s public defender succeeded and turned over the results from a private lab to prosecutors. None of the 13 hairs recovered from the stocking \u2014 including the one that the FBI said matched Tribble\u2019s \u2014 shared Tribble\u2019s or Wright\u2019s genetic profile, conclusively ruling them out as sources, according to mitochondrial DNA analyst Terry Melton of the private lab. \u201cThe government\u2019s entire theory of prosecution \u2014 that Mr. Tribble and Mr. Wright acted together to kill Mr. McCormick \u2014 is demolished,\u201d wrote Sandra K. Levick, chief of special litigation for the D.C. Public Defender Service and the lawyer who represents Gates, Tribble and Odom. In a motion to D.C. Superior Court Judge Laura Cordero seeking Tribble\u2019s exoneration, Levick wrote: \u201cHe has waited thirty-three years for the truth to set him free. He should have to wait no longer.\u201d In an interview, Tribble, who served 28 years in prison, said that whether the court grants his request or not, he sees it as a final chance to assert his innocence. \u201cMs. Levick has been like an angel,\u201d Tribble added, \u201c. . . and I thank God for DNA.\u201d Details of the new round of hair testing illustrate how hair analysis is highly subjective. The FBI scientist who originally testified at Tribble\u2019s trial, Special Agent James A. Hilverda, said all the hairs he retrieved from the stocking were human head hairs, including the one suitable for comparison that he declared in court matched Tribble\u2019s \u201cin all microscopic characteristics.\u201d In August, Harold Deadman, a senior hair analyst with the D.C. police who spent 15 years with the FBI lab, forwarded the evidence to the private lab and reported that the 13 hairs he found included head and limb hairs. One exhibited Caucasian characteristics, Deadman added. Tribble is black. But the private lab\u2019s DNA tests irrefutably showed that the 13 hairs came from three human sources, each of African origin, except for one \u2014 which came from a dog. \u201cSuch is the true state of hair microscopy,\u201d Levick wrote. \u201cTwo FBI-trained analysts, James Hilverda and Harold Deadman, could not even distinguish human hairs from canine hairs.\u201d Hilverda declined to comment. Deadman said his role was limited to describing characteristics of hairs he found. Kirk Odom\u2019s case shares similarities with Tribble\u2019s. Odom was convicted of raping, sodomizing and robbing a 27-year-old woman before dawn in her Capitol Hill apartment in 1981. The victim said she spoke with her assailant and observed him for up to two minutes in the \u201cdim light\u201d of street lamps through her windows before she was gagged, bound and blindfolded in an hour-long assault. Police put together a composite sketch of the attacker, based on the victim\u2019s description. About five weeks after the assault, a police officer was talking to Odom about an unrelated matter. He thought Odom looked like the sketch. So he retrieved a two-year-old photograph of Odom, from when he was 16, and put it in a photo array for the victim. The victim picked the image out of the array that April and identified Odom at a lineup in May. She identified Odom again at his trial, telling jurors her assailant \u201chad left her with an image of his face etched in her mind.\u201d At trial, FBI Special Agent Myron T. Scholberg testified that a hair found on the victim\u2019s nightgown was \u201cmicroscopically like\u201d Odom\u2019s, meaning the samples were indistinguishable. Prosecutors explained that Scholberg had not been able to distinguish between hair samples only \u201ceight or 10 times in the past 10 years, while performing thousands of analyses.\u201d But on Jan. 18 of this year, Melton, of the same lab used in the Tribble case, Mitotyping Technologies of State College, Pa., reported its court-ordered DNA test results: The hair in the case could not have come from Odom. On Feb. 27, a second laboratory selected by prosecutors, Bode Technology of Lorton, turned over the results of court-ordered nuclear DNA testing of stains left by the perpetrator on a pillowcase and robe. Only one man left all four partial DNA profiles developed by the lab, and that man could not have been Odom. The victim \u201cwas tragically mistaken in her identification of Mr. Odom as her assailant,\u201d Levick wrote in a motion filed March 14 seeking his exoneration. \u201cOne man committed these heinous crimes; that man was not Kirk L. Odom.\u201d Scholberg, who retired in 1985 as head of hair and fiber analysis after 18 years at the FBI lab, said side-by-side hair comparison \u201cwas the best method we had at the time.\u201d Odom, who was imprisoned for 20 years, had to register as a sex offender and remains on lifelong parole. He says court-ordered therapists still berate him for saying he is not guilty. Over the years, his conviction has kept him from possible jobs, he said. \u201cThere was always the thought in the back of my mind . . . \u2018One day will my name be cleared?\u2019 \u201d Odom said at his home in Southeast Washington, where he lives with his wife, Harriet, a medical counselor. Federal prosecutors declined to comment on Tribble\u2019s and Odom\u2019s specific claims, citing pending litigation. One government official noted that Odom served an additional 16 months after his release for an unrelated simple assault that violated his parole. However, in a statement released after being contacted by The Post, Machen, the U.S. attorney in the District, acknowledged that DNA results \u201craise serious questions in my mind about these convictions.\u201d \u201cIf our comprehensive review shows that either man was wrongfully convicted, we will promptly join him in a motion to vacate his conviction, as we did with Donald Gates in 2009,\u201d Machen said. ****Popularized in fiction by Sherlock Holmes, hair comparison became an established forensic science by the 1950s. Before modern-day DNA testing, hair analysis could, at its best, accurately narrow the pool of criminal suspects to a class or group or definitively rule out a person as a possible source. But in practice, even before the \u201c \u2018CSI\u2019 effect\u201d led jurors to expect scientific evidence at every trial, a claim of a hair match packed a powerful, dramatic punch in court. The testimony, usually by a respected scientist working at a respected federal agency, allowed prosecutors to boil down ambiguous cases for jurors to a single, incriminating piece of human evidence left at the scene. Forensic experts typically assessed the varying characteristics of a hair to determine whether the defendant might be a source. Some factors were visible to the naked eye, such as the length of the hair, its color and whether it was straight, kinky or curly. Others were visible under a microscope, such as the size, type and distribution of pigmentation, the alignment of scales or the thickness of layers in a given hair, or its diameter at various points. Other judgments could be made. Was the hair animal or human? From the scalp, limbs or pubic area? Of a discernible race? Dyed, bleached or otherwise treated? Cut, forcibly removed or shed naturally? But there is no consensus among hair examiners about how many of these characteristics were needed to declare a match. So some agents relied on six or seven traits, while others needed 20 or 30. Hilverda, the FBI scientist in Tribble\u2019s case, told jurors that he had performed \u201cprobably tens of thousands of examinations\u201d and relied on \u201cabout 15 characteristics.\u201d Despite his testimony, Hilverda recorded in his lab notes that he had measured only three characteristics of the hair from the stocking \u2014 it was black, it was a human head hair, and it was from an African American. Similarly, Scholberg\u2019s notes describe the nightgown hair in Odom\u2019s case in the barest terms, as a black, human head hair fragment, like a sample taken from Odom. Hilverda acknowledged that results could rule out a person or be inconclusive. However, he told jurors that a \u201cmatch\u201d reflected a high likelihood that two hairs came from the same person. Hilverda added, \u201cOnly on very rare occasions have I seen hairs of two individuals that show the same characteristics.\u201d In Tribble\u2019s case, federal prosecutor David Stanley went further as he summed up the evidence. \u201cThere is one chance, perhaps for all we know, in 10 million that it could [be] someone else\u2019s hair,\u201d he said in his closing arguments, sounding the final word for the government. Stanley declined to comment. The Tribble and Odom cases demonstrate problems in hair analysis that have been known for nearly 40 years. In 1974, researchers acknowledged that visual comparisons are so subjective that different analysts can reach different conclusions about the same hair. The FBI acknowledged in 1984 that such analysis cannot positively determine that a hair found at a crime scene belongs to one particular person. In 1996, the Justice Department studied the nation\u2019s first 28 DNA exonerations and found that 20 percent of the cases involved hair comparison. That same year, the FBI lab stopped declaring matches based on visual comparisons alone and began requiring DNA testing as well. Yet examples of FBI experts violating scientific standards and making exaggerated or erroneous claims emerged in 1997 at the heart of the FBI lab\u2019s worst modern scandal, when Bromwich\u2019s investigation found systematic problems involving 13 agents. The lab\u2019s lack of written protocols and examiners\u2019 weak scientific qualifications allowed bias to influence some of the nation\u2019s highest-profile criminal investigations, the inspector general said. From 1996 through 2004, a Justice Department task force set out to review about 6,000 cases handled by the 13 discredited agents for any potential exculpatory information that should be disclosed to defendants. The task force identified more than 250 convictions in which the agents\u2019 work was determined to be either critical to the conviction or so problematic \u2014 for example, because a prosecutor refused to cooperate or records had been lost \u2014 that it completed a fresh scientific assessment of the agent\u2019s work. The task force was directed to notify prosecutors of the results. The only real notice of what the task force found came in a 2003 Associated Press account in which unnamed government officials said they had turned over results to prosecutors and were aware that defendants had been notified in 100 to 150 cases. The officials left the impression that anybody whose case had been affected had been notified and that, in any case, no convictions had been overturned, the officials said. But since 2003, in the District alone, two of six convictions identified by The Post in which forensic work was reassessed by the task force have been vacated. That includes Gates\u2019s case, but not those of Tribble and Odom, who are awaiting court action and were not part of the task force review. The Gates exoneration also shows that prosecutors failed to turn over information uncovered by the task force. In addition to Gates, the murder cases in Texas and Maryland and a third in Alaska reveal examples of shortcomings. All three cases, in addition to the District cases, were handled by FBI agent Malone, whose cases made up more than 90 percent of scientific reviews found by The Post. In Texas, the review of Benjamin Herbert Boyle\u2019s case got underway only after the defendant was executed, 16 months after the task force was formed, despite pledges to prioritize death penalty cases. Boyle was executed six days after the Bromwich investigation publicly criticized Malone, the FBI agent who worked on his case, but the FBI had acknowledged two months earlier that it was investigating complaints about him. The task force asked the Justice Department\u2019s capital-case review unit to look over its work, but the fact that it failed to prevent the execution was never publicized. In Maryland, John Norman Huffington\u2019s attorneys say they were never notified of the findings of the review in his case, leaving them in a battle over the law\u2019s unsettled requirements for prosecutors to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence and over whether lawyers and courts can properly interpret scientific findings. In Alaska, Newton P. Lambert\u2019s defenders have been left to seek DNA testing of remaining biological evidence, if any exists, while he serves a life sentence for a 1982 murder. Prosecutors for both Huffington and Lambert claim they disclosed findings at some point to other lawyers but failed to document doing so. In Lambert\u2019s case, The Post found that the purported notification went to a lawyer who had died. Senior public defenders in both states say they received no such word, which they say would be highly unlikely if it in fact came. Malone, 66, said he was simply using the best science available at the time. \u201cWe did the best we could with what we had,\u201d he said. Even the harshest critics acknowledge that the Justice Department worked hard to identify potentially tainted convictions. Many of the cases identified by the task force involved serious crimes, and several defendants confessed or were guilty of related charges. Courts also have upheld several convictions even after agents\u2019 roles were discovered. Because of the focus on Malone, many questionable cases were never reviewed. But as in the Tribble and Odom cases, thousands of defendants nationwide have been implicated by other FBI agents, as well as state and local hair examiners, who relied on the same flawed techniques. In 2002, the FBI found after it analyzed DNA in 80 selected hair cases that its agents had reported false matches more than 11 percent of the time. \u201cI don\u2019t believe forensic science truly understood the significance of microscopic hair comparison, and it wasn\u2019t until [DNA] that we learned that 11 percent of the time, two hairs can be microscopically similar yet come from different people,\u201d said Dwight E. Adams, who directed the FBI lab from 2002 to 2006. Yet a Post review of the small fraction of cases in which an appeals court opinion describes FBI hair testimony shows that several FBI agents gave improper testimony, asserting the remote odds of a false match or invoking bogus statistics in the absence of data. For example, in testimony in a Minnesota bank robbery case, also in 1978, Hilverda, the agent who worked on Tribble\u2019s case, reiterated that he had been unable to distinguish among different people\u2019s hair \u201conly on a couple of occasions\u201d out of more than 2,000 cases he had analyzed. In a 1980 Indiana robbery case, an agent told jurors that he had failed to tell different people\u2019s hair apart just once in 1,500 cases. After a slaying in Tennessee that year, another agent testified in a capital case that there was only one chance out of 4,500 or 5,000 that a hair came from someone other than the suspect. \u201cThose statements are chilling to read,\u201d Bromwich said of the exaggerated FBI claims at trial. Todd, the FBI spokeswoman, said bureau lab reports for more than 30 years have qualified their findings by saying that hair comparisons are not a means of absolute positive identification. She requested a list of cases in which agents departed from guidelines in court. The Post provided nine cases. Todd declined to say whether the bureau considered taking steps to determine whether other agents intentionally or unintentionally misled jurors. \u201cOnly Michael Malone\u2019s conduct was questioned in the area of hair comparisons,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThe [inspector general] did not question the merits of microscopic hair comparisons as a scientific discipline.\u201d Experts say the difference between laboratory standards and examiners\u2019 testimony in court can be important, especially if no one is reading or watching what agents say. \u201cIt seemingly has never been routine for crime labs to do supervision based on trial testimony,\u201d said University of Virginia School of Law professor Brandon L. Garrett. \u201cYou can have cautious standards, but if no one is supervising their implementation, it\u2019s predictable that analysts may cross the line.\u201d A review of the task force documents, as well as Post interviews, found that the Justice Department struggled to balance its roles as a law enforcer defending convictions, a minister of justice protecting the innocent, and a patron and practitioner of forensic science. By excluding defense lawyers from the process and leaving it to prosecutors to decide case by case what to disclose, authorities waded into a legal and ethical morass that left some prisoners locked away for years longer than necessary. By adopting a secret process that limited accountability, documents show, the task force left the scope and nature of scientific problems unreported, obscuring issues from further study and permitting similar breakdowns. \u201cThe government has hidden behind the veil of secrecy to shield these abuses despite official assurances that justice would be done,\u201d said David Colapinto, general counsel of the National Whistleblowers Center. The American Bar Association and others have proposed stronger ethics rules for prosecutors to act on information that casts doubt on convictions; opening laboratory and other files to the defense; clearer reporting and evidence retention; greater involvement by scientists in setting rules for testimony at criminal trials; and more scientific training for lawyers and judges. Other experts propose more oversight by standing state forensic-science commissions and funding for research into forensic techniques and experts for indigent defendants. A common theme among reform-minded lawyers and experts is taking the oversight of the forensic labs away from police and prosecutors. \u201cIt\u2019s human to make mistakes,\u201d said Steven D. Benjamin, president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong not to learn from them.\u201d More specifically, the D.C. Public Defender Service, Benjamin\u2019s group and others said justice would be served by retesting hair evidence in convictions nationwide from 1996 and earlier. \u201cIf microscopic hair analysis was a key piece of evidence in a conviction, and it was one of only a limited amount of evidence in a case, would it be worthwhile to retest that using mitochondrial DNA? I would say absolutely,\u201d said Adams, the former FBI lab director. The promised review by federal prosecutors of hair convictions in the District would not include cases before 1985, when FBI records were computerized, and would not disclose any defendant\u2019s name. That approach would have missed Gates, Odom and Tribble, who were convicted earlier. Representatives for Machen, the FBI and the Justice Department also declined to say why the review should be limited to D.C. cases. The Post found that 95 percent of the troubled cases identified by the task force were outside the District. Avis E. Buchanan, director of the D.C. Public Defender Service, said her agency must be \u201ca full participant\u201d in the review, which it has sought for two years, and that it should extend nationwide. \u201cSurely the District of Columbia is not the only place where such flawed evidence was used to convict the innocent,\u201d she said. **Read more fromThe Washington Post:** Shuttle Discovery heads to D.C. area Changes made in discipline polices evident in Fairfax Coffee battle brews at farmers markets For homeless dad, nothing is easy", "Title: Review of FBI forensics does not extend to federally trained state, local examiners Content: Thousands of criminal cases at the state and local level may have relied on exaggerated testimony or false forensic evidence to convict defendants of murder, rape and other felonies. The forensic experts in these cases were trained by the same elite FBI team whose members gave misleading court testimony about hair matches and later taught the local examiners to follow the same suspect practices, according to interviews and documents. In July, the Justice Department announced a nationwide review of all cases handled by the FBI Laboratory\u2019s hair and fibers unit before 2000 \u2014 at least 21,000 cases \u2014 to determine whether improper lab reports or testimony might have contributed to wrongful convictions. But about three dozen FBI agents trained 600 to 1,000 state and local examiners to apply the same standards that have proved problematic. None of the local cases is included in the federal review. As a result, legal experts say, although the federal inquiry is laudable, the number of flawed cases at the state and local levels could be even higher, and those are going uncorrected. The FBI review was prompted by a series of articles in The Washington Post about errors at the bureau\u2019s renowned crime lab involving microscopic hair comparisons. The articles highlighted the cases of two District men who each spent more than 20 years in prison based on false hair matches by FBI experts. Since The Post\u2019s articles, the men have been declared innocent by D.C. Superior Court judges. Two high-profile local-level cases illustrate how far the FBI training problems spread. In 2004, former Montana crime lab director Arnold Melnikoff was fired and more than 700 cases questioned because of what reviewers called egregious scientific errors involving the accuracy of hair matches dating to the 1970s. His defense was that he was taught by the FBI and that many FBI-trained colleagues testified in similar ways, according to previously undisclosed court records. In 2001, Oklahoma City police crime lab supervisor Joyce Gilchrist lost her job and more than 1,400 of her cases were questioned after an FBI reviewer found that she made claims about her matches that were \u201cbeyond the acceptable limits of science.\u201d Court filings show that Gilchrist received her only in- depth instruction in hair comparison from the FBI in 1981 and that she, like many practitioners, went largely unsupervised. Federal officials, asked about state and local problems, said the FBI has committed significant resources to speed the federal review but that state and local police and prosecutors would have to decide whether to undertake comparable efforts. FBI spokeswoman Ann Todd defended the training of local examiners as \u201ccontinuing education\u201d intended to supplement formal training provided by other labs. The FBI did not qualify examiners, a responsibility shared by individual labs and certification bodies, she said. Michael Wright, president of the National District Attorneys Association, said local prosecutors cannot simply order labs to audit all or even a sample of cases handled by FBI-trained examiners, because such an undertaking might be time- and cost-prohibitive for smaller agencies. The chairman of the laboratory accreditation board of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors said it is gathering information to guide members. \u201cIt is something we take seriously, and we are going to address it accordingly,\u201d said Pamela Bordner, the chairman. The announcement in July of the Justice Department review of federal cases marked a turnabout from the mid-1990s, when an inquiry looked at a limited number of cases and, in the area of hair comparison, focused on the work of one examiner at the FBI lab. In its April investigation, The Post found that Justice Department officials failed to tell many defendants or their attorneys of questionable evidence and that the results of the review remained largely secret. In addition, Justice Department officials have for years blamed errors on isolated failures by rogue examiners, careless prosecutors or inept defense lawyers. But former chiefs of the FBI lab\u2019s hair and fiber unit now acknowledge that the problems were more widespread. Some federal examiners, testifying in cases across the country, overstated the importance of hair evidence and responded to questions about the scientific accuracy of hair matches by citing amorphous statistics drawn from their experience. Moreover, they said, examiners should have been trained to accurately portray their findings in court. When local lab examiners went to the FBI for training, they received the same inadequate instruction. Myron T. \u201cMike\u201d Scholberg, hair unit chief from 1978 to 1985, and Alan T. \u201cAl\u201d Robillard, chief from 1988 to 1990, said that in hindsight, they were not properly trained to answer a crucial question for jurors: How often might the hairs of different people appear to match? The truth is that there was no scientific way to know. Instead of simply acknowledging the uncertainty, agents at times drew statistics from their cases without explaining why that was an incomplete or even misleading answer, Scholberg and Robillard said. Harold A. \u201cHal\u201d Deadman Jr., a top hair unit scientist who trained more than 600 examiners from 1972 to 1987, said he always explained to jurors why his case experience gave an incomplete picture of the accuracy of hair comparisons. But Deadman said DNA testing should be done in all convictions that were based mainly on visual hair comparison, because of weaknesses in trial testimony and examiner results. Interviews with the former unit chiefs, as well as more than 20 practitioners, scientists and legal experts, and a review of court records, training notes and transcripts of meetings indicate that some FBI lab examiners tried to skirt the limitations of their scientific findings in testimony and that they were encouraged to do so by their trainers. As warnings about the problems mounted \u2014 through DNA exonerations, whistleblower complaints, court rulings \u2014 bureau managers implemented stronger protocols, but they limited disclosure of the problems they found. More forthcoming disclosure could have jeopardized convictions. \u201cIf the FBI is going to be a role model, we need to see this federal audit lead to wider audits of labs across the country,\u201d said Myrna S. Raeder, a Southwestern University law professor who is leading an American Bar Association effort to improve forensic evidence. \u201cIf you had even the elite FBI analysts out there crossing the line and exaggerating the forensics, that sent a terrible message that \u2018anything goes.\u2019 \u201d In a letter this month to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department acknowledged that FBI examiners \u201cmay have exceeded the limits of the science by overstating . . . conclusions\u201d in some cases. \u201cThe Department and the Bureau believe it is necessary and appropriate that defense counsel and defendants are informed of any inappropriate testimony by FBI Laboratory examiners,\u201d Acting Assistant Attorney General Judith C. Appelbaum wrote. Before DNA profiling, testimony of a hair match was a powerful way for prosecutors to boil down an ambiguous case to a single, incriminating piece of physical evidence left at the scene of a crime. No other agency in the United States performed as many hair examinations or believed as much in the technique as the FBI lab\u2019s 10-member unit of hair examiners. But The Post\u2019s investigation earlier this year showed how agents, prosecutors or both sometimes exaggerated the significance of the evidence they had. For example, in a 1980 Indiana robbery case, one agent told jurors that he was unable to distinguish between the hair of different people just once in 1,500 cases he had analyzed. In one of the District cases, federal prosecutors claimed that the agent had been unable to tell hair samples apart only \u201ceight or 10 times in the past 10 years, while performing thousands of analyses.\u201d In another, the prosecutor said in closing arguments, \u201cThere is one chance, perhaps for all we know, in 10 million that it could [be] someone else\u2019s hair.\u201d That defendant was declared innocent this year. The problem is, as an expert peer review panel wrote in Melnikoff\u2019s case, \u201cThere is not \u2014 and never was \u2014 a well established probability theory for hair comparison.\u201d As noted in 2009 by the chief of the FBI hair team, the proper answer to the question of how often hairs from different people might match is, \u201cWe do not know.\u201d Peter Neufeld, co-founder of the Innocence Project, said hair analysis practitioners should end their resistance to putting scientists in charge of setting clear, consistent standards for lab reports and testimony. \u201cWhen the stakes involve life and liberty, those scientific parameters and standards should be set by scientists, not by law enforcement,\u201d said Neufeld, whose organization advocates for people trying to prove their innocence through DNA testing. The Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers were consulted by the FBI on the national review. The FBI has known for decades that hair found at a crime scene is a valuable piece of evidence. Before DNA testing, agents would use a microscope to compare the evidence with a sample of hair from a suspect. A visual analysis can tell animal hairs from human hairs; human hairs by race and body part; whether hairs were dyed or otherwise treated; and how hairs were removed from the body. Visual comparison, at its best, also can accurately narrow the pool of criminal suspects to a class or group or definitively rule out a person as a possible source. But it was not possible to declare an absolute match. So the FBI had a problem. Hair comparisons could yield good evidence. But agents struggled to explain to a jury how good. Morris Samuel \u201cSam\u201d Clark was the head of the FBI\u2019s hair unit when it began training state and local analysts in 1973. He said he long believed that examiners could trace hairs from a crime scene to a particular person with a high degree of probability \u2014 even though there is no scientific proof that is possible. But Clark, who did graduate work in biology at Harvard and retired in 1979, said laboratory experience should not be discounted. He did \u201chundreds and hundreds of comparisons\u201d over nearly 20 years, and he believes that he was a qualified court expert, he said in an interview from his home in Spotsylvania County. The FBI\u2019s training regimen, which required agents to compare hairs side-by-side under high-powered microscopes for a year before working on live cases, gave lab veterans confidence that they could tell the difference between individuals\u2019 hairs just as an ordinary person could distinguish between their faces. They embraced a set of vague standards. In written lab reports, FBI agents would include the caveat that hair examination was not a basis for positive identification. In court, however, they could suggest that it would be highly unlikely for an examiner\u2019s match to be wrong. The bureau left it up to individual labs and examiners to explain matters to jurors. Agents were trained to say that in their \u201cpersonal experience\u201d they had rarely seen hairs from different people that looked alike. That evolved into jurors\u2019 hearing numbers that had a huge impact even if they lacked scientific grounding. After a slaying in Tennessee in 1980, an FBI agent testified in a capital case that there was one chance in 4,500 or 5,000 that a hair came from someone other than the suspect. But as experts from around the world would later note, the FBI-taught answer was misleading. In reality, FBI examiners did not compare every hair to every other hair they had ever examined. They simply compared crime-scene hairs and hair samples from individuals relevant in each case. Examiners kept no \u201cdatabase\u201d of samples, which went back to police evidence files. And differences between hairs are so fine that a person can generally keep only a handful of hairs in mind at any time. \u201cThe claim you could keep all those hairs in your head and sort them in your mind, that would be hard to do,\u201d said Mark R. Wilson, a 23-year FBI veteran who helped develop DNA testing for hair in 1996. \u201cAfter about three or four [hairs], it gets confusing.\u201d The claim was called into question at an international conference hosted by the FBI in 1985, but the training was not overhauled for at least a dozen more years. \u201cIt was not promoted, put it that way,\u201d to give juries a more accurate picture of the limits of the technique, said John W. Hicks, who spent about five years in the hair unit in the 1970s and who directed the FBI lab from 1989 to 1994. Robillard, the former hair unit chief, said that he always waited for a defense attorney to challenge his claims about the accuracy of hair analysis but that neither they nor judges usually caught the logical sleight of hand. \u201cYou would expect a defense attorney to say, \u2018Wait \u2014 are you, Robillard, saying you compared every person\u2019s hair to every other one?\u2019 That\u2019s the screaming question for cross-examination,\u201d Robillard said. \u201cI can\u2019t off the top of my head remember ever having a defense attorney say that.\u201d Like the other agents interviewed, Robillard, now a private expert who lives on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, in Massachusetts, said FBI experts were not trying to mislead but to convey in layman\u2019s terms why they were confident in their hair associations. Not all former chiefs agreed that examiners should have testified differently. Edward L. \u201cEd\u201d Burwitz, who led the unit from 1985 to 1988, called that \u201ca legal question that I don\u2019t feel confident to answer.\u201d Like others, Burwitz said he never got complaints about examiners\u2019 testimony. He called the recent criticism a matter of \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking.\u201d Clark also defended his work, including the FBI training. \u201cThis was not fly-by-night stuff, not idle conclusions on our part. I think we made a very significant contribution to the criminal justice system,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIf [examiners] made a mistake, it\u2019s a personal mistake, and it\u2019s not a matter of [our] training them . . . nor the whole science of microscopic hair exams, because we did our best.\u201d The FBI lab began training state and local hair examiners in 1973, as the bureau worked with the nation\u2019s crime lab directors to expand forensic methods. Deadman said he trained about 600 examiners from outside the FBI between 1973 and 1987, and others estimated that an additional 450 examiners were trained over the next dozen years. No one knows how many cases local and state hair examiners handled. Estimates of their collective caseload vary from 20 percent to more than half of all hair exams during the period under review. Most of the rest were federal cases. Yet, FBI agents and others say they doubt the quality of the training, even as they acknowledge that it was a valued credential for state and local labs. Instead of working with hairs for an entire year before starting trial work, some local trainees spent a week at the FBI Academy at Quantico and then went back to labs where they were one of one or two designated \u201ccriminalists,\u201d analyzing everything from hair to paint chips to glass, Robillard said. They might handle a handful of hair cases a year, using substandard equipment while under constant pressure from investigators. With 200-plus crime labs serving 18,000 police agencies in the early 1990s, DeForest said, \u201cThere was no monitoring of people. . . . That whole thing for something this complex was ill-conceived, and maybe [the FBI] should have recognized that.\u201d In 2004, Melnikoff lost his crime lab job in Washington because of errors whose discovery led to three overturned convictions in Montana. One of those cases was the child rape conviction of Jimmy Ray Bromgard, who served more than 15 years in prison before DNA tests showed he didn\u2019t commit the crime. At Bromgard\u2019s 1987 trial, Melnikoff said he found head and pubic hairs \u201cmicroscopically indistinguishable\u201d from Bromgard\u2019s, and he told the jury that there was less than one chance in 10,000 of a coincidence. He based this assertion on his case experience, multiplying by 100 the 1 in 100 frequency with which he claimed to have seen head and pubic hairs he could not tell apart. After Bromgard was exonerated in 2002, a five-member panel that included Deadman said Melnikoff made \u201cegregious misstatements not only of the science of forensic hair examinations but also of genetics and statistics.\u201d Melnikoff\u2019s defense in a civil suit brought by Bromgard was that he simply acted as he was trained. Michael A. Howard, a 24-year Oregon State Police veteran who also took the Quantico course, noted that Melnikoff\u2019s examination and lab report followed FBI practices. \u201cI took the [FBI] class in 1982 and was not advised to avoid the use of probabilities. . . . We were taught that our own experience was most important, and that is what Mr. Melnikoff was doing,\u201d Howard told a federal court in Montana in 2007. In an interview, Howard elaborated. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say, \u2018Use it,\u2019 and they didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t use it,\u2019 \u201d he said. Instead, he said, the FBI\u2019s position was, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to decide for yourself, based on your experience, how strong you can state it.\u201d Gilchrist also was accused of misidentifications, misleading testimony and withholding or destroying evidence. In 2001, she was fired from the Oklahoma City Police Department, and authorities set out to reexamine more than 1,400 assigned cases, including a dozen death row cases. In one case, David Johns Bryson spent 16 years in prison for a 1982 rape, but he was freed in 1999 after DNA results showed another man committed the crime. Gilchrist testified that she found four hairs that were like Bryson\u2019s and that she never saw hairs from different people with the same characteristics. She said, \u201cI would think it would be impossible not to be able to distinguish hairs from two different individuals.\u201d But in April 2001, Douglas W. Deedrick, then head of the FBI unit, found that Gilchrist\u2019s matches were wrong and that by implying hairs were \u201cunique,\u201d Gilchrist \u201cmisrepresent[ed] the science.\u201d Again, Gilchrist took her cue from bureau training. In her files, she kept a certificate of completion from her January 1981 class, including a session on \u201cDiscussion of the significance of hair comparisons, testimony matters and pertinent literature.\u201d In her notes, she copied the FBI caveat that one cannot conclusively determine the source or origin of a hair. But, the notes also showed that instructors were teaching their students how to sidestep the limits of the science \u2014 by pointing out their experience. \u201cCan conclude source \u2014 point out however in my experience, have rarely seen hairs from diff. people exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics,\u201d the notes say. FBI veterans pointed out that the hair unit gave up members who helped the agency pioneer forensic nuclear and mitochondrial DNA testing. As DNA testing became more common, the limits of microscopic hair comparison became clearer. Max Houck, who was the unit\u2019s first civilian, non-agent examiner, said he changed the way he testified in the late 1990s after consulting an old statistics textbook. Training of examiners also shifted away from citing numbers, probabilities or statistics by 2001, Houck said, as the lab gained outside accreditation and replaced agents with civilian scientists. Asked why it took until now to correct errors, Houck, the head of the new D.C. Department of Forensic Science, cited a variety of reasons: The \u201cconservatism\u201d of forensic science, the legal system\u2019s dependence on precedence and, finally, government bureaucracy and the FBI\u2019s proud culture. \u201cCould it have happened sooner? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWould it have cost more money? Yes. Would it have been more disruptive? Probably. Would we have gotten a better answer? I don\u2019t know.\u201d To his list, Houck added one more question. \u201cDoes that mean justice was served? Not necessarily.\u201d", "Title: U.S. reviewing 27 death penalty convictions for FBI forensic testimony errors Content: ****An unprecedented federal review of old criminal cases has uncovered as many as 27 death penalty convictions in which FBI forensic experts may have mistakenly linked defendants to crimes with exaggerated scientific testimony, U.S. officials said. The review led to an 11th-hour stay of execution in Mississippi in May. It is not known how many of the cases involve errors, how many led to wrongful convictions or how many mistakes may now jeopardize valid convictions. Those questions will be explored as the review continues. The discovery of the more than two dozen capital cases promises that the examination could become a factor in the debate over the death penalty. Some opponents have long held that the execution of a person confirmed to be innocent would crystallize doubts about capital punishment. But if DNA or other testing confirms all convictions, it would strengthen proponents\u2019 arguments that the system works. ****FBI officials discussed the review\u2019s scope as they prepare to disclose its first results later this summer. The death row cases are among the first 120 convictions identified as potentially problematic among more than 21,700 FBI Laboratory files being examined. The review wasannounced last July by the FBI and the Justice Department, in consultation with the Innocence Project and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL). The unusual collaboration came after The Washington Post reported last year that authorities had known for years that flawed forensic work by FBI hair examiners may have led to convictions of potentially innocent people, but officials had not aggressively investigated problems or notified defendants. At issue is a once-widespread practice by which some FBI experts exaggerated the significance of \u201cmatches\u201d drawn from microscopic analysis of hair found at crime scenes. Since at least the 1970s, written FBI Laboratory reports typically stated that a hair association could not be used as positive identification. However, on the witness stand, several agents for years went beyond the science and testified that their hair analysis was a near-certain match. The new review listed examples of scientifically invalid testimony, including claiming to associate a hair with a single person \u201cto the exclusion of all others,\u201d or to state or suggest a probability for such a match from past casework. Whatever the findings of the review, the initiative is pushing state and local labs to take similar measures. For instance, the Texas Forensic Science Commission on Friday directed all labs under its jurisdiction to take the first step to scrutinize hair cases, in a state that has executed more defendants than any other since 1982. Separately, FBI officials said their intention is to review and disclose problems in capital cases even after a defendant has been executed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do this to be a model for anyone \u2014 other than when there\u2019s a problem, you have to face it, and you have to figure how to fix it, move forward and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d FBI general counsel Andrew Weissmann said. \u201cThat tone and approach is set from the very top of this building,\u201d he said, referring to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III. David Christian \u201cChris\u201d Hassell, director of the FBI Laboratory, said the review will be used to improve lab training, testimony, audit systems and research, as it has done when previous breakdowns were uncovered. The lab overhauled scientific practices when whistleblowers revealed problems in 1996 and again after an FBI fingerprint misidentification in a high-profile 2003 terrorism case, he said. \u201cOne of the things good scientists do is question their assumptions. No matter what the field, what the discipline, those questions should be up for debate,\u201d Hassell said. \u201cThat\u2019s as true in forensics as anything else.\u201d Advocates for defendants and the wrongly convicted called the undertaking a watershed moment in police and prosecutorial agencies\u2019 willingness to re-open old cases because of scientific errors uncovered by DNA testing. Peter J. Neufeld, co-founder of the Innocence Project, which supports inmates who seek exoneration through DNA testing, applauded the FBI, calling the review historic and a \u201cmajor step forward to improve the criminal justice system and the rigor of forensic science in the United States.\u201d Norman L. Reimer, executive director of the NACDL, also praised the effort, predicting that it would have \u201can enormous impact on the states\u201d and calling on the defense bar to represent indigent convicts. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a very big job as this unfolds,\u201d said Reimer, whose group has spent 1,500 hours identifying cases for the second round of review. Under terms finalized with the groups last month, the Justice Department will notify prosecutors and convicted defendants or defense attorneys if an internal review panel or the two external groups find that FBI examiners \u201cexceeded the limits of science\u201d when they claimed to link crime scene hair to defendants in reports or testimony. If so, the department will assist the class of prisoners in unprecedented ways, including waiving statutes of limitations and other federal rules that since 1996 have restricted post-conviction appeals. The FBI also will test DNA evidence if sought by a judge or prosecutor. The review will prioritize capital cases, then cases in which defendants are imprisoned. Unlike DNA analysis, there is no accepted research on how often hair from different people may appear the same. The federal inquiry came after the Public Defender Service helped exonerate three D.C. men through DNA testing that showed that three FBI hair examiners contributed to their wrongful convictions for rape or murder in the early 1980s. The response has been notable for the department and the FBI, which in the past has been accused of overprotecting its agents. Twice since 1996, authorities conducted case reviews largely in secret after the scientific integrity of the FBI Lab was faulted. Weissmann said that although earlier reviews lawfully gave prosecutors discretion to decide when to turn over potentially exculpatory material to the defense, greater transparency will \u201clessen skepticism\u201d about the government\u2019s motives. It also will be cheaper, faster and more effective because private parties can help track down decades-old cases. Scientific errors \u201care not owned by one side,\u201d he said. \u201cThis gives the same information to both sides, and they can litigate it.\u201d The review terms could have wide repercussions. The FBI is examining more than 21,000 federal and state cases referred to the FBI Lab\u2019s hair unit from 1982 through 1999 \u2014 by which time DNA testing of hair was routine \u2014 and the bureau has asked for help in finding cases before lab files were computerized in 1985. Of 15,000 files reviewed to date, the FBI said a hair association was declared in about 2,100 cases. Investigators have contacted police and prosecutors in more than 1,200 of those cases to find out whether hair evidence was used in a conviction, in which case trial transcripts will be sought. However, 400 of those cases have been closed because prosecutors did not respond. On May 7, Mississippi\u2019s Supreme Court stayed the execution of Willie Jerome Manning for a 1992 double homicide hours before he was set to die by lethal injection. FBI cases may represent only the tip of the problem. While the FBI employed 27 hair examiners during the period under review, FBI officials confirmed for the first time this week that records indicate that about 500 people attended one-week hair comparison classes given by FBI examiners between 1979 and 2009. Nearly all of them came from state and local labs. State and local prosecutors handle more than 95 percent of violent crimes. In April, the accreditation arm of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors declined to order state and local labs to conduct reviews, but issued a public notice recommending that each laboratory evaluate the impact of improper statements on past convictions, reminding them of their ethical obligation to act in case of a potential miscarriage of justice. FBI Lab officials say they have not been contacted by other labs about their review or who completed the FBI classes.", "Title: FBI lab failures should lead to reform Content: KIRK L.ODOM was incarcerated for 20 years and Donald E. Gates for nearly 30 for crimes they did not commit. Santae A. Tribble spent 28 years behind bars, even though DNA evidence now shows he almost undoubtedly was not the culprit. All of the men were erroneously convicted in the District, in part, on the basis of forensic evidence analyzed by the FBI. Problems within the FBI lab, particularly with hair-sample analysis, were well known to the agency and the Justice Department; a task force spent some nine years reviewing cases after a whistleblower revealed possible shortcomings. In a series of articles, The Post\u2019s Spencer S. Hsu and a team of reporters documented how the Justice Department failed to notify lawyers representing prisoners whose fate hinged on the FBI analysis. Some prisoners spent years behind bars before becoming aware of the lab issues. The problem continues to this day. The full results of the Justice Department task force\u2019s investigation have not been made public. Even when the task force discovered flaws in a case, the information was turned over only to prosecutors, who were then left to decide whether the results needed to be brought to the attention of defense lawyers. In addition, the task force reviewed only cases involving one FBI analyst whose work was called into question; The Post identified cases where other analysts\u2019 work resulted in convictions of innocent defendants. The FBI argues that hair-sample analysis \u2014 in which samples from a suspect are analyzed microscopically and compared with samples found on a victim or crime scene \u2014 is a vital and legitimate tool. Advances in DNA testing, which allows for genetic analysis of evidence, \u201cshould not be perceived as diminishing the value of prior practices and testimonies,\u201d according to an FBI statement. Administration law enforcement officials say that all hair samples collected after 1996 have been subjected to DNA testing, when possible; they point out that such testing is sometimes off limits because of the size or condition of the sample. \u201cIn cases where microscopic hair exams conducted by the FBI resulted in a conviction, the FBI is evaluating whether additional review is warranted,\u201d the statement said. This does not go far enough. The agency should not be considering \u201cwhether additional review is warranted\u201d but how such a review should be conducted; members of the defense bar should be part of these discussions. Any review should, as a start, include DNA testing of hair samples in all cases that ended in conviction \u2014 regardless of which analyst performed the work \u2014 for which the defendant is still imprisoned or on parole. The Justice Department should make its task force results public; if such broad disclosure presents privacy or security problems, the department should at least make all FBI forensic analysis and task force material available to defense lawyers. The failings documented by The Post point to the need for better scientific standards in forensic testing and a more open process for the disclosure of evidence and information in criminal proceedings. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) is weighing legislation to expand the role of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology to set such standards. Congress also should change the law regarding discovery. Prosecutors should not be deciding which pieces of evidence seem exculpatory and must be turned over to the defense. They should be required to open their files to defense lawyers, with exceptions for witness protection or national security. ****", "Title: Prosecutors criticize D.C. crime lab\u2019s handling of some DNA evidence Content: D.C. prosecutors have stopped sending DNA evidence to the city\u2019s new state-of-the-art crime lab after they said they discovered errors in the way analysts determined whether a sample can be linked to a suspect or a victim. Prosecutors have hired two outside DNA experts to review 116 cases, including rapes and homicides, and have been notifying defense attorneys. In one federal case, prosecutors said, the D.C. lab concluded that a defendant\u2019s DNA could have been on the magazine of a gun seized as evidence. But an expert who reviewed the data said the lab should have interpreted the results to mean that the defendant was not the source of the DNA. In other cases, prosecutors said, the lab either understated or overestimated the likelihood that a particular person\u2019s DNA was left at a crime scene. Officials at the Department of Forensic Sciences, which is located in a $220 million facility that opened in 2012, defend their work and say disagreements among scientists in the field are not uncommon. The dispute has essentially created a standoff between the city-run lab and federal prosecutors in the nation\u2019s capital. U.S. Attorney Ronald C. \u00adMachen Jr. said that his office has been paying to send evidence for testing at outside labs and that so far an additional 102 cases have been farmed out. At the same time, independent experts are taking a fresh look at the cases analyzed by the District\u2019s lab. \u201cTo date, we have not found any evidence to suggest any wrongful conviction and have not acted to dismiss any cases,\u201d Machen said in a statement. \u201cHowever, in an abundance of caution, we are conducting a rigorous review of the analysis done in current and older cases to ensure that criminal defendants are treated fairly.\u201d Max M. Houck, director of the Department of Forensic Sciences, said that the lab follows the same protocols in place at many city and state labs across the country and that experts may disagree on how to interpret evidence. The lab has made recent improvements, he said, but he stands by the work done before those changes. \u201cThis is an estimate \u2014 an estimate of probability,\u201d said Houck, a former FBI supervisor who worked in the agency\u2019s anthropology and trace evidence unit. \u201cThe issue is that their experts would do the analysis differently. Differently isn\u2019t wrong,\u201d Houck said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a financial planner doing a financial assessment of someone\u2019s net worth in U.S. currency and in Japanese yen. They\u2019re both correct, just different measurements.\u201d Houck said he could not explain why the outside experts sometimes reached very different conclusions, because he does not know which methods they used. The issue involves the analysis of combinations of genetic material from more than one person \u2014 such as samples collected from weapons, cars or a victim\u2019s body. The scientists try to tease out who left the DNA behind. Although TV dramas such as \u201cCSI\u201d make DNA testing look simple, experts said, such disputes are not uncommon and the industry does not have a single accepted method for interpreting DNA mixtures. John M. Butler, special assistant to the director for forensic science at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, based in Gaithersburg, Md., recently wrote a 600-page book on the topic. \u201cYou can have the same data, and scientists at different labs \u2014 or even within the same lab \u2014 can interpret that data differently,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe are trying to help standardize things. We are in the process of working on that.\u201d Prosecutors said they first became concerned in September, when they asked an outside expert to look over the DNA evidence in an upcoming case, a practice they said is not uncommon. Tavon Barber was accused of two 2013 burglaries, prosecutors said. In one case, laptops and car keys were taken from a home while two people slept inside, and the thief used the keys to steal a car. In the other case, a robber woke a sleeping couple and sexually assaulted the woman while holding her husband at gunpoint. The expert found errors in the interpretation of six pieces of evidence analyzed by the Department of Forensic Sciences, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. The biggest mistake involved the analysis of DNA found on the stolen car\u2019s gearshift, prosecutors said. D.C. analysts looking at the evidence found that the car owner\u2019s DNA could have been on the gearshift and said the chance that a randomly selected person had the same genetic traits was 1 in 3,290. The outside experts said the more accurate finding was 1 in 9. Lab officials noted that the evidence was not key to the case \u2014 it did not involve linking a suspect to a crime. But prosecutors say they worry generally about systemic problems. \u201cWe examined this case in the lead-up to the trial. We weren\u2019t looking for this error,\u201d Vincent H. Cohen Jr., principal assistant U.S. attorney, said in an interview. \u201cThe test was done correctly, but the analysis was incorrect.\u201d Barber ultimately was convicted. His trial lawyer did not return phone calls, and his current attorney declined to comment. Once prosecutors began notifying defense attorneys this year about the concerns, some cases were delayed. Although most of the affected cases are in D.C. Superior Court, some are in federal court. Prosecutors began sending new cases to two outside labs for testing. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t say how much that costs. Prosecutors and defense attorneys say the dispute could trigger a wave of appeals or civil lawsuits. The impact ultimately will depend on how important DNA evidence was in each case, and what other evidence linked a defendant to a crime. \u201cThis could be devastating for some of the cases where convictions have already been made and helpful to those defendants whose cases relied on DNA calculations,\u201d defense attorney Kevin Mosley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. attorneys or DFS have a handle on the breadth of this problem.\u201d Mosley said prosecutors sent a letter alerting him there was a problem with DNA evidence in a client\u2019s burglary case. Mosley\u2019s client was convicted of several charges including unlawful entry and tampering with evidence and was sentenced to 22 1/ 2 years in jail. But Mosley said DNA evidence was not used in the trial and prosecutors relied on other evidence, so he doesn\u2019t think his case would be affected. Prosecutors said they did use DNA evidence, but it has not been called into question. After prosecutors raised their concerns, lab officials created a four-member advisory panel selected from the industry to review their procedures. In November, the panel suggested enhancements for when and how to evaluate DNA mixtures, and how decisions are made about each analysis. Houck said the changes refine the way the lab reaches its conclusions but are not overhauls. \u201cYou can improve things without there being an error or problem,\u201d he said. The lab, Houck says, still conducts DNA evidence examination for agencies including the U.S. Park Police and the D.C. attorney general\u2019s office. In a statement, D.C. police Chief Cathy L. Lanier noted that the lab is accredited, and she said that anyone with issues should go to the board that granted the accreditation. One pending case that got conflicting results is that of George Cocroft, who is accused of a 2012 sexual assault. The District lab concluded that Cocroft\u2019s DNA could have been at the scene and said that the chance of finding a random person with similar genetic traits was 1 in 318. But when prosecutors had an outside DNA expert perform a different calculation, which they say was consistent with the lab\u2019s protocols, the odds shifted to 1 in 900 million. Cocroft\u2019s attorney, Craig N. Moore, said he was informed about the inconsistent findings two weeks ago. He said he was not sure what he was going to do with the information because his client says the sex was consensual, so the DNA may not relevant. The trial is set to begin this month, but Moore said he is considering asking for a delay to examine the findings. Moore says his biggest concern now is not knowing the full impact of the DNA dispute for Cocroft\u2019s case and others, or which conclusions to believe. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. **Read more:** Federal review stalled after finding forensic errors by FBI How the courts trap people who were convicted by bad forensics How accurate is forensic analysis?

The allegations involved various kinds of fraud in diverse areas of health care, ranging from prescription drugs to home health care to physical therapy. \"They submitted dishonest claims, they charged excessive fees and they prescribed unnecessary drugs,\" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said at a news conference. \"As this takedown should make clear, health-care fraud is not an abstract violation. It\u2019s not a benign offense. It\u2019s a serious crime.\" Among the alleged fraud uncovered: More than 60 people were charged with fraud related to the prescription drug benefit portion of Medicare. The Medicare Fraud Strike Force began its work in 2007 and has charged more than 2,900 people with health-care fraud, who have billed Medicare for $8.9 billion.", "Title: Government arrests 243 in largest crackdown on health-care fraud Content: In Miami, the owners of a mental-health treatment center allegedly billed Medicare for tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of intensive therapy that actually involved just moving people to different locations. Some of them had dementia so severe that they couldn\u2019t even communicate. In Los Angeles, prosecutors say, one doctor collected $23 million for more than 1,000 power wheelchairs and other equipment his patients didn\u2019t need \u2014 which he often didn\u2019t even provide. And in Michigan, another physician allegedly prescribed unnecessary narcotic painkillers in return for the use of his patients\u2019 IDs to generate additional false billings. When they tried to escape the scheme, authorities say, he threatened to cut off the medications, to which his patients were addicted. It turns out that the government was checking on these and other doctors, nurses and providers of psychotherapy, home care, drugs, physical therapy and medical equipment. In the single largest crackdown in an eight-year campaign against health-care fraud, the Justice Department charged 243 people Thursday with $712 million in false billings to Medicare \u2014 the medical insurance program for the elderly \u2014 and Medicaid, which serves the poor. Some of the schemes were so brazen that FBI Director James B. Comey likened health-care providers to \u201cATMs\u201d for the unscrupulous. \u201cIf you want to find criminals, you follow the money,\u201d Comey said at a news conference to announce the charges. \u201cIn this case, we followed the money and found criminals who were attracted to doctor\u2019s offices, to clinics, to hospitals, to nursing homes in search of what they viewed as an ATM, an ATM that was a freebie to them but is actually filled with taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d The alleged fraud spanned the country, from Miami \u2014 where 73 of the accused worked \u2014 to Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, New Orleans, Detroit and beyond. A sizable number allegedly targeted Medicare Part D, the prescription-drug benefit that is the fastest-growing part of the huge program. Since it was put together in 2007, the government \u201cstrike force\u201d that focuses on health-care fraud has charged more than 2,300 people accused of falsely billing Medicare for more than $7 billion. Its efforts have been expanded with $350 million provided under the Affordable Care Act. Medicare has long been an enticing target for fraud. Last year, The Washington Post reported, a power wheelchair scam netted perpetrators untold amounts of the program\u2019s money over 15 years. In 2011, a Miami health-care executive was sentenced to 50 years in prison for submitting more than $205 million in phony claims. As in the past, many of the current cases involve people who allegedly recruited patients, the beneficiaries themselves and others who allegedly received kickbacks for their involvement, the government charged.", "Title: Texas doctor charged in $375 million Medicare scam Content: A Texas doctor and five owners of home health-care agencies were arrested Tuesday on charges that they fraudulently billed Medicare and Medicaid nearly $375 million in what authorities described as the largest case of its kind. The doctor, Jacques Roy, 54, of Rockwall, was charged with masterminding a Medicare fraud conspiracy over the past six years. The alleged fraud involved classifying as homebound 11,000 patients recruited by a network of more than 500 agencies, then billing Medicare for services and home visits that were either not medically necessary or were not provided, according to the indictment, filed in the Northern District of Texas. Roy\u2019s alleged scheme resulted in more than $350 million being fraudulently billed to Medicare and more than $24 million to Medicaid. The indictment called it the largest home health-care fraud ever committed and the biggest health-care fraud case brought against a single doctor. \u201cDr. Roy and his co-conspirators for years ran a well-oiled fraudulent enterprise . . . making millions by recruiting thousands of patients for unnecessary services and billing Medicare for those services,\u201d said Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division. Tuesday\u2019s indictment marks the latest in a series of federal Medicare fraud cases, which have become a centerpiece of the Obama administration\u2019s push to bring down health-care costs. In 2011, health-care-fraud prevention and enforcement efforts recovered nearly $4.1 billion that had been stolen or improperly taken from federal programs, the highest annual amount ever recovered, according to a recent report by the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services. \u201cWe are demonstrating to those who would commit health-care fraud that it won\u2019t be worth it,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General James Cole. \u201cIf you do this, we will track you down and prosecute you.\u201d Investigators from the Department of Health and Human Services targeted Roy after analyzing Medicare billing data and finding a disproportionate number of home health claims for which he was the certifying physician. Between January 2006 and November 2011, authorities say, Roy and his company, Medistat Group Associates, created a fraudulent \u201ccottage industry\u201d in the Dallas-Fort Worth area that brought in millions of dollars, according to court records. Roy certified more Medicare beneficiaries for home health services and had more purported patients than any other medical practice in the country. \u201cUsing sophisticated data analysis, we can now target suspicious billing spikes,\u201d said Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. The analysis found that in 2010, Roy \u201ccertified\u201d more than 5,000 patients for home health care; 99 percent of physicians certified no more than 104 people for such care, Levinson said. As part of his business, Roy allegedly maintained a \u201c485 Department,\u201d named after the number on the Medicare form on which the care plans were documented. He instructed his employees to complete the 485s by signing his name by hand or using his electronic signature. In what prosecutors called a \u201cboiler room,\u201d employees worked all day placing his signature on approvals for home health services, according to the indictment. When investigators searched Roy\u2019s home, they found evidence of overseas bank accounts and fake identification cards. Also in his house were the books \u201cHide Your Assets and Disappear: A Step-by-Step Guide to Vanishing Without a Trace,\u201d and \u201cThe Offshore Money Manual,\u201d suggesting 23 worldwide locations favorable to offshore banking, according to court records. The documents also show that Roy owns a sailboat named \u201cOne Trick Pony.\u201d Roy, a native of Canada, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health-care fraud and nine counts of substantive health-care fraud. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. Along with the indictment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the suspension of payments to an additional 78 home health agencies associated with Roy, based on credible allegations of fraud against them. Roy\u2019s office manager was also charged. Owners of the agencies working with Roy would recruit people so Medistat could bill unnecessary home visits and medical services, the indictment said. They would go door to door in neighborhoods to recruit patients. The home health agencies not only allegedly took advantage of the elderly, they preyed on the disadvantaged, authorities say. One of the agency owners who was charged, Charity Eleda, 51, of Rowlett, Tex., allegedly sent recruiters to the Bridge homeless shelter in Dallas, paying them $50 for each person they signed up. \u201cThis case and our new detection tools are examples of our growing ability to stop Medicare fraud,\u201d said Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Bill Corr. Staff researcher Julie Tate contributed to this report.", "Title: \u2018Junkie hunters\u2019 lured addicts to scam \u2018sober home\u2019 in $58 million fraud, feds say Content: But more was happening inside than treatment. In December 2014, state and federal investigators raided the offices\u2019 of the sober home\u2019s chief executive, Eric Snyder, as part of a larger fraud investigation. Two and a half years later, on Tuesday, the sober home entrepreneur was arrested with another former employee, Christopher Fuller. According to federal prosecutors, the operators used the sober home and a related abuse treatment facility as piggy banks, bilking insurance companies for $58 million in fraudulent claims. The operators fed their enterprise by aggressively recruiting residents, resorting to bribes, strip club trips, and even drugs to keep the beds full, prosecutors said. Both men are charged with conspiracy to commit health-care fraud. Snyder\u2019s attorney, Bruce Zimet, told the Post his client has had numerous discussions with investigators since the 2014 raid. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they decided to file a complaint this week, but we anticipate having additional conversations where we will present information which we believe will mitigate against them going forward with an indictment,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really fit your profile of a fraudster. He has literally saved scores of lives.\u201d Fuller\u2019s attorney did not reply to an email requesting comment on this week\u2019s complaint. The charges come as scrutiny tightens around South Florida\u2019s sober home industry, a business accounting for $1 billion of annual revenue in Palm Beach County alone. The laundry list of bad acts alleged in an FBI affidavit filed this week in federal court is considerable. According to the report, shortly after the September 2014 raid, a high-ranking staffer with the sober home contacted the FBI. The informant \u2014 who is not named in the document \u2014 told investigators Snyder would regularly overbill clients\u2019 insurance. \u201cFor example, if a patient was discharged\u201d on the first day of a given month, the home would \u201ccontinue to bill that client\u2019s insurance company for treatment through the end of the month.\u201d Within a few weeks, investigators also spoke to patients who reported their insurers were billed for services they didn\u2019t receive: One former resident reported never going to treatment sessions on the weekend, yet once being billed $2,754 for a Sunday session; another patient recalled being billed for daily treatments while the patient couldn\u2019t possibly have been at the house \u2014 he was serving a jail sentence for a probation violation. The urine tests were another well-greased scam at the homes, investigators allege. The affidavit notes former employees said Snyder\u2019s businesses would routinely collect urine samples \u201cmultiple times a week.\u201d They could all be billed to the insurance. But to run up the dollar signs, the employees were instructed to pour one sample into two different cups \u2014 doubling the profit. Different samples were also mixed together to create more. And instead of using in-house easy tests, the homes would ship the samples out to labs, increasing a $5-$10 expenditure to a much more pricey option. The drug tests also were worthless \u2014 if a resident failed, they were not forced to leave. Volume was key to the fraud, investigators say, and Snyder allegedly was willing to go to extreme \u2014 and illegal \u2014 lengths to keep feet walking through the door. Under Florida and federal law, patients and residents in treatment facilities and sober homes cannot receive kickbacks or bribes for their attendance. But Snyder, the affidavit says, would knock down the weekly $200 rent for residents if they went \u2014 and were then billed \u2014 for a set number of treatment sessions. According to the affidavit, the owner allegedly told one employee he would rather \u201ceat $200 to make $5000.\u201d Finding residents fell to \u201cjunkie hunters,\u201d including Christopher Fuller. The affidavit describes these as essentially headhunters who were paid off the books to keep new residents coming. Witnesses told investigators Fuller would troll around AA meetings for susceptible addicts, and also had tipsters among the staffs at shady motels where addicts regularly got high. Fuller also allegedly \u201cwas known to give clients drugs or alcohol as an enticement to attend\u201d the programs, the affidavit says. Former employees told investigators that when they informed Fuller the addicts he was dropping off couldn\u2019t enter the program when they were still high or using, Snyder intervened, enrolling them anyway. Fuller, witnesses also told investigators, would \u201cfrequent strip clubs, casinos, and hotels and restaurants with patients and employees.\u201d Investigators say Snyder was bilking the system from his earliest days in the business. \u201cFrom at least January 1, 2011 through September 30, 2015,\u201d the affidavit says, Snyder \u201csubmitted claims of approximately $58,209,385 to these Insurance plans.\u201d In turn, investigators say, insurers gave Snyder $18,656,743.

As Brian Vastagreported:_ Fast on the heels of a solar storm that delivered a glancing blow over the weekend \u2014 triggering bright auroras in Canada and Scandinavia \u2014 the sun released an even more energetic blast of radiation and charged plasma overnight that could disrupt GPS signals and the electrical grid Tuesday, especially at high latitudes, space weather experts warned Monday. Already, the storm could be affecting satellite communications as streams of radiation from the sun bounce across the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which extends above the surface into space. With the radiation storm in progress now, satellite operators could be experiencing trouble, and there are probably impacts as well to high-frequency [radio] communications in polar regions,\u201d said Doug Biesecker, a physicist at the Space Weather Prediction Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo. Such radio blackouts can force airlines to reroute flights between North America and Europe or Asia. Biesecker said any rocket launches scheduled for Monday probably would have to be scrubbed, although he said he was unaware of any. The solar storm is the biggest since 2005, he added. The storm will peak Tuesday when a speeding cloud of plasma and charged particles blasts past Earth, distorting the planet\u2019s magnetic field with impacts possibly ranging as far south in latitude as Texas and Arizona. _The solar storm created light shows called northern lights over England and Canada on Tuesday, with more expected in days to come. As APexplained:_ The northern lights have lit up the skies above Scotland, northern England and northern parts of Ireland \u2014 and more light shows are expected in the next few days. The northern lights are sometimes seen from northern Scotland but they were also visible Monday night from northeast England and Ireland, where such sightings are a rarity. Ken Kennedy, director of the Aurora section of the British Astronomical Association, said the northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, may be visible for a few more days. The Canadian Space Agency posted a geomagnetic storm warning Tuesday after residents were also treated to a spectacular show in the night sky. Monday night\u2019s auroras were likely just variations in normal background solar wind, not the solar storm that erupted Sunday, said physicist Doug Biesecker at the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. That was the biggest solar storm in more than six years. He said a geomagnetic storm Tuesday that came from that solar storm seemed to mostly miss Earth, going a bit north, so it was unlikely that auroras would extend too far south Tuesday night. _While scientists have rated this solar storm below an extreme event, some warn of more powerful solar storms in the next few years. As Melissa Bell reported:_ Streaming toward Earth right now is a blast of radiation and charged plasma the sun released Sunday night. Space weather experts warned about possible damage to the electrical grid when the charged particles hit Earth with full force midday Tuesday. Despite the warnings that the solar storm would be the biggest since 2005, the National Weather Service is rating the storm a 3 on a scale of 1 (minor) to 5 (extreme). Prof. W. Jeffrey Hughes, director of the Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling at Boston University, said that the storm was significant only in relation to the past six years, but when put into historical perspective, it was probably not going to be a major storm \u2014 and that far larger storms will most likely occur over the next two years. \u201cIn the last six years, we\u2019ve gone through the quietest solar period in more than a 100 years,\u201d Hughes said. Next year will be a maximum peak for sun activity, so Hughes says the solar disturbances are predictable. \u201cActivity should pick up over the next few years. This is the biggest taste of what\u2019s going to come next year and 2014.\u201d Solar activity waxes and wanes on a roughly 11-year cycle. Hughes says the sun has been relatively quiet since 2002. **More fromThe Washington Post ** Some may benefit from global warming Astronomers seek photo of black hole \u2018Leap second\u2019 will stay to keep clocks aligned with earth\u2019s rotation", "Title: Solar storm causes spectacular aurora borealis; is there more to come?

As Melissa Bellreported:_ The largest solar flares since 2005 blasted past Earth on Tuesday. Despite warnings from space experts of possible interference to GPS signals, the solar storm turned out to be a mild 2 on a scale of 1 to 5. Even so, it created some spectacular aurora borealis the past few nights. _As the Associated Pressreported, the sun is likely to be more active in the next few years:_ U.S. space weather experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday evening that so far they had heard of no problems from the storm that triggered the auroras, which made it as far south as Wales, where the weather often doesn\u2019t cooperate with good viewing. It was part of the strongest solar storm in years, but the sun is likely to get even more active in the next few months and years, said physicist Doug Biesecker at the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cTo me this was a wake up call. The sun is reminding us that solar max is approaching,\u201d Biesecker said. \u201cA lot worse is in store for us. We hope that you guys are paying attention. I would say we passed with flying colors.\u201d Even before particles from the solar storm reached the Earth on Tuesday, a different aurora Monday night was dancing across the sky as far south as Ireland and England, where people rarely get a chance to catch the stunning light show. Those northern lights were likely just variations in normal background solar wind, not the solar storm that erupted Sunday, Biesecker said. _Outer space weather can have large and disruptive effects on electronic devices and GPS at high altitudes even during a mild solar storm. As Brian Palmerreported _:_ _ Solar weather experts, or heliophysicists, refer to the expulsion of large amounts of particles from the sun as a coronal mass ejection. They can involve as much as 220 billion pounds of charged material. While these incidents aren\u2019t going to blow up Earth or even noticeably alter the Washington region\u2019s weather on a given day, they can be a very serious problem. \u201cSolar weather events have been occurring for millions of years, but they didn\u2019t directly affect humans until recently,\u201d says Madhulika Guhathakurta. She\u2019s the head scientist for NASA\u2019s Living With a Star project, which is helping astrophysicists better understand solar weather. \u201cHundreds of years ago, technology was too primitive to be disturbed by space weather. Today, we rely on countless devices that are vulnerable to a solar storm.\u201d Think of all of the material you use that requires an electrical current: computers, televisions, cellphones, etc. Every one of those things is susceptible to a massive blast of ions from the sun. Planes flying over the poles are vulnerable to coronal mass ejections. Satellites can go haywire, and even collide, as a result of solar weather events. And astronauts on the international space station are cautioned to stay inside during solar incidents to avoid a massive blast of radiation. **More fromThe Washington Post ** Some may benefit from global warming Astronomers seek photo of black hole \u2018Leap second\u2019 will stay to keep clocks aligned with earth\u2019s rotation", "Title: Photos: Gorgeous aurora paint high latitude skies; Repeat performance possible tonight Content: A stream of solar wind bombarded the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere Monday and Tuesday nights, producing beautiful aurora over the northern tier of the U.S. and Canada.

Coronal holes are basically large \u2018nozzles\u2019 on the Sun for high-speed solar wind They don\u2019t erupt suddenly like solar flares, but rather emit a constant and fast solar wind. Solar wind typically flows at about one million miles per hour, but through coronal holes it can be twice as fast. NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issued a geomagnetic storm watch for possible \u201cstrong\u201d storming Tuesday night, but the event ended up being more in the \u201cminor\u201d range. SWPC says minor storming remains possible into tonight and may briefly spike into the moderate range. Thus, another evening of aurora watching is possible in some of the same areas where it was visible the last two nights. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And the sun is continuing to generate space weather activity likely to impact Earth over the coming days. Positioned near the center of the solar disk, NOAA sunspot region 2443 is large and dynamic. It produced a solar flare, technically an R1 (Minor) Radio Blackout, earlier today. There are early indications of a coronal mass ejection (CME), or plasma wave, too pending further satellite imagery. An attribute of the flare was the solar radio noise emitted at 1415 MHz, very near to the frequencies used by GPS. This interference may have affected some GPS users, typically those doing those most precise positioning. The sun is a powerful radio transmitter, and can overwhelm satellite transmissions when it erupts. _[The devastating potential of an extreme solar storm and what the White House is doing about it]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Forecasters will watch this region closely as it sits in a prime spot for disruptions at Earth.

But most interesting often means most troublesome for technologies, so it makes for a double-edged sword. Space weather events can be ranked using NOAA\u2019s three scales, which quantify the severity of radio blackouts (R-scale), solar radiation storms (S-scale) and geomagnetic storms (G-scale). All of these things affect our technology and skies here on Earth. One way to rank the activity is to use the NOAA Space Weather Scales. Similar to meteorological rankings, they go from category 1 (minor) to 5 (extreme). *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A sizable space weather event with impacts to critical technologies will likely register on all three scales. Heuristically, the event includes an eruption at the Sun (R scale), followed quickly by energetic protons near the earth (S scale), and then finally the Geomagnetic Storm (G scale) when the CME launched during the initial solar eruption turns earth\u2019s magnetic field \u201chead over heels.\u201d The time sequence of the whole thing ranges from a few minutes after the solar burst for the radio blackout, to days later for the magnetic storm. [ _This is still the hardest space weather problem, and it\u2019s a huge threat to infrastructure_] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico There was just one event that rang the bell on all three scales in 2015 \u2014 June 22. Multiple eruptions from the surface of the sun contributed to this event. It registered an R2-moderate radio blackout, an S3-strong solar radiation storm and a G4-severe geomagnetic storm \u2014 the second-highest severity on the 5-point scale. Another way to look at it, this event was characterized as a nine out of 15, the sum of all three scales. An S3-strong solar radiation storm fills the polar caps with charged particles. In storms of this magnitude, high-latitude flights may make the decision to use a more southerly route to avoid any impacts. [ _June 22:Solar eruptions trigger severe geomagnetic storm on Earth_] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The solar wind was streaming fast toward our planet June 22, and contained a southward-oriented magnetic field, which tends to product the largest geomagnetic storms \u2014 and most intense auroras \u2014 on Earth. The June 22 event triggered a magnificent aurora that was seen all the way south into Virginia and Texas. Mid to late June was the stormiest period of the year for the sun. Fittingly, it was around the summer solstice when many cultures historically stop to mark the significance of the sun.

The geomagnetic storm peaked at G4-severe, and was caused by the combination of two coronal mass ejections from an active sunspot region. Combining all three scales, the storm was ranked as a five out of 15. Vivid aurora were seen as far south as the Midwest on St. Patrick\u2019s Day.", "Title: Strong geomagnetic storm lights up the sky with beautiful aurora (Photos) Content: A surprisingly strong geomagnetic storm swept over Earth\u2019s magnetosphere on Sunday, sparking a beautiful green and purple aurora that was visible as far south as the Northeast. On Friday, the Space Weather Prediction Center was calling for a G1-minor geomagnetic storm. But the solar wind came in hot and fast, and G3-strong storming was observed Sunday evening. The driver of the disturbance was a fast, magnetized solar wind flowing from a coronal hole. Typically, the strongest geomagnetic storms and the associated aurora are caused by eruptions from the surface of the sun called coronal mass ejections. But the sun is now in the waning part of solar cycle 24, which means solar eruptions are becoming much less common, and storming from coronal holes more so. Coronal holes are long-lived voids in the solar corona that can persist for weeks to months. They rotate in step with the bright photosphere \u2013 the sun as we see it. Over the past few days, a potent coronal hole has rotated toward Earth like a fire hose of unimpeded solar wind.

The writer tells all. Content: One of the most wrenching cases involved a woman whose obvious stomach problems were repeatedly brushed off \u2014 until doctors discovered she had advanced appendix cancer. One of the most memorable was a man whose six-year itching stumped two dozen specialists, a case solved by an astute young physician who kept pushing for an answer. And one of the most frustrating was a woman whose multiple health problems clearly seemed related to her faulty artificial hip, a case I had to drop because of her doctor\u2019s stubbornness. Seven years ago, I began writing The Post\u2019s \u201cMedical Mysteries\u201d column, which each month recounts a puzzling case from the perspective of someone who was intimately involved: the patient, a parent, a spouse and sometimes the doctor who made the correct diagnosis. While medical diagnosis may seem straightforward, the column illustrates how complicated and difficult it can be, illuminating the often opaque process by examining where and why it went awry and how easy it is for mistakes to snowball. Sometimes serendipity plays a key role, as it did when a patient\u2019s deep tan reminded a doctor of photographs of a former president with the same unusual illness. Medical Mysteries also document the impact on families of the search for answers, a process that can take decades and involve considerable pain, anxiety and uncertainty. Over the years, diagnoses have ranged from the prosaic \u2014 a Washington lawyer whose raging case of head lice was missed by three dermatologists \u2014 to the exotic: life-threatening conditions so rare that most doctors will never see them. Among these was a New York nurse whose daring cardiac treatment became the basis for a recent episode of the hit television series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d Other Medical Mysteries cases have been featured on ABC News, \u201cMystery Diagnosis\u201d and an Animal Planet show called \u201cMonsters Inside Me.\u201d The column has inspired many reader questions, some of which recur perennially in online comments. The new year seems like a good time to answer some of them. Consider this an appeal as well: I\u2019m always looking for interesting cases that meet the column\u2019s specs. I regularly hear from readers or their desperate relatives seeking help for a debilitating illness that has confounded numerous doctors. I would love to hear from these patients after they have an answer, but I can\u2019t help them find one. I\u2019m a medical journalist, not a medical doctor, and unfortunately I can\u2019t make referrals. Some people are convinced they solved their mystery themselves, often by avoiding a particular substance or food they deem toxic or by ingesting megadoses of over-the-counter supplements. Others swear by treatments for which there is no scientific evidence, often provided by a specialist in alternative medicine. These cases don\u2019t work, in part because their outcomes are impossible to prove. To be considered for the column, patients must be willing to use their real names, submit relevant medical records or allow me access to them, and permit the doctor who made the correct diagnosis (or, if that person is unavailable, the current treating physician) to discuss details of their case. There are no age limits: I\u2019ve written about a 6-week-old boy and an 87-year-old woman. And the problem need not be unusual; columns have focused on a teenage boy who turned out to have whooping cough, a college student who suffered for years from textbook gallbladder disease and a Fox news reporter with a common, painful eye condition. Medical records are a must. Some patients insist that their doctor never mentioned the diagnosis that years later turned out to be correct or failed to order a crucial test. I\u2019ve found that records sometimes tell a different story, contradicting those assertions. But records alone are not enough. Sometimes a doctor and patient have such different perspectives that it is impossible to proceed. One Maryland woman was convinced that the systemic ailments that had plagued her for several years were caused by her artificial hip \u2014 a flawed device that emitted metal particles and for which the manufacturer recently settled a multibillion-dollar class action suit. Her voluminous medical records seemed to confirm the link. But her internist adamantly refused to attribute any of her problems to the device, which had been recalled by its manufacturer, and her orthopedist could not be reached. Case \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 closed. Many are submitted by patients or their relatives, others by doctors or hospitals; some stem from articles in medical journals. Regardless of the source, all require a subject who is willing to speak candidly. Most patients say their purpose in recounting sometimes harrowing experiences is to spare others a similar ordeal; some want to shed light on a little-known disease or condition. At times there is a happy ending \u2014 treatment in the form of a drug or surgery that provides a fix \u2014 but that is far from the rule. Jamie Fear, a former editor at the National Academy of Sciences who died in 2011 of a malignancy that had been repeatedly misdiagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome, talked about what it was like to be dismissed as a hypochondriac by skeptical doctors. Jan Weymouth, a manager at the National Institutes of Health who died in 2012, said she was ultimately grateful for the years before doctors figured out she had an unusual form of lung cancer, news that forced her to confront a terminal illness. And engineer Jeff Williams, whose cirrhosis was wrongly attributed to alcoholism, not a genetic disease, is on a crusade to raise awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis caused by the dangerous accumulation of iron in the blood. Williams also struggles with anger about the callous way he was treated by doctors and nurses and remains convinced that his liver might be less severely damaged had the doctors who dismissed him as a drunk followed up on the results of a telltale lab test he later discovered buried in his medical records. I am especially interested in cases that advance knowledge about public-health issues, particularly controversial ones. I regularly read (okay, skim) major medical journals, which sometimes suggest possible columns. One of the most memorable was a 2011 case report in Pediatrics about five children whose seizures and other neurological problems were believed by their parents to have been triggered by the DPT vaccine. Years later, testing revealed that they actually had a rare genetic mutation present at birth that caused a severe form of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. The vaccine, doctors reported, had nothing to do with the seizures. Because the symptoms of Dravet typically surface at 6 months, the age at which children receive a DPT shot, the vaccine had been erroneously blamed. I contacted one of the report\u2019s authors, who secured permission to provide the names of some affected families. Two refused to participate, but Laura Cossolotto, who heads a group composed of families whose children have Dravet, agreed to tell the story of her daughter\u2019s decade-long ordeal and eventual diagnosis at the Mayo Clinic. Until a genetic test revealed the errant gene, Cossolotto said she, too, had blamed the vaccine for her daughter\u2019s life-threatening problems. The column is meant to illuminate the diagnostic process, not affix blame \u2014 even when it might seem well deserved. Naming those who flubbed the case \u2014 sometimes a long list \u2014 doesn\u2019t advance the larger story. But having the doctor who figured it out explain how he or she did so and why things might have gone wrong provides information that might be useful to readers. In one instance a doctor who made an incorrect diagnosis based on evidence available at the time \u2014 telling parents their young son had mild cerebral palsy instead of a far more serious degenerative disorder \u2014 discussed what made her question her diagnosis and change her mind, suspecting something that was, sadly, correct. Her reasons included emotional factors, which can affect the diagnostic process in unexpected ways. And in one unexpected twist, a respected specialist who missed a relatively easy diagnosis in one mystery was the same person who made the right call in a far more difficult case published months later. Some, like the vaccine case, take months, while others, especially those proposed by a hospital\u2019s media relations staff, typically proceed far more quickly: The patient has signed whatever release the hospital requires, the doctor has agreed to cooperate, and obtaining records is a relative snap. Because delays are inevitable and a mix of cases \u2014 age, sex, profession and illness or condition \u2014 is essential, I juggle several cases simultaneously. After 80 columns, finding maladies that haven\u2019t been covered or don\u2019t echo previous cases becomes more difficult. **Why isn\u2019t the answer revealed in the first few paragraphs?** Seriously?

Read previous columns at wapo.st/medicalmysteries.", "Title: Our kids caught a $1,000 cough. Be careful: Yours can get it, too. Content: They told us it was allergies. One winter week, my 7-year-old twins started with stuffed noses and sore throats. We did what parents typically do: We broke out the throat spray, the cough syrup, the decongestant. Instead of going away, the problem got worse. The pediatrician did a test for strep, which came back negative. After that, he just shrugged and told us it was a viral infection, probably stemming from an allergy to dust and pollen. It\u2019s very difficult to test for a virus, he told us. Pinning down an exact diagnosis would require blood work, and for many children the trauma of having blood drawn to diagnose a condition for which nothing can be done outweighs knowing the actual condition. And with most cases of viral infection, all you can do is wait it out. There is nothing more frustrating for a parent than to hear the words \u201cjust wait it out,\u201d but according to Michael Brady, a spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, waiting it out is basically all anyone can do when dealing with a virus. \u201cParents want to be part of trying to help their child get better,\u201d he said, \u201cbut sometimes doing nothing is better than doing something, particularly when the treatment could be worse than the virus itself.\u201d Brady, an Ohio pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases in children, emphasized that cold medicines do nothing to cure a virus. They don\u2019t even treat the symptoms they are meant to treat. \u201cJust say no to cold medicines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not work, and they have some medications in them that make kids irritable and upset. They are more dangerous than helpful. All the over-the-counter meds are discouraged for children of any age.\u201d Brady said that most such medications fall into two camps: antihistamines and decongestants. \u201cAntihistamines do nothing for colds, because there has been no increase in histamines to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd decongestant syrup is meant to clear the nose and sinuses, but it must go through the patient\u2019s bloodstream first, meaning in order to get enough to be effective, you\u2019d have to ingest way too much of it.\u201d Even worse, he said, are cold medicines that include fever reducers, because the mixture makes it difficult for parents to know exactly how much fever reducer their child has taken. \u201cIf you need to give Motrin or Tylenol, give it by itself,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t waste time or money on combination cold medicines.\u201d Of course, it was already too late for my family. I had my kids take anything they could, hoping something would help. By the next week, their stuffiness had turned into wracking coughs. We went back to the doctor. This time we were given prescription cough syrup, prescription allergy medication and an inhaler to be used four times a day to decrease the inflammation in the lungs. We were sent home with the same diagnosis: a virus stemming from allergies. None of that regime worked. My husband and I watched helplessly as the twins coughed and hacked and struggled to breathe each day and night. Our frustration turned to anger. We were going to doctors for this. We had tried to catch it early. We had already spent more than $200 fighting it. Why was nothing helping us? \u201cA lot of insurances make patients pay co-pays, and as a result, parents come in and pay, and they want to know more than \u2018it\u2019s just a virus, wait it out,\u2019 \u201d Brady said. \u201cThey feel like they paid for more than that, but really, they got quite a bit because they got someone to confirm that they shouldn\u2019t spend money on expensive tests and medicines.\u201d But surely a virus can morph and change and become more severe as time goes on, right? By the third week, our children had shown no improvement, and their breathing was still more difficult. This time the doctor prescribed a nasal allergy spray and told us to invest in a humidifier. The diagnosis remained the same. We now sat at $400. Brady said that honey works best for coughs and that Vicks VapoRub is better for decongesting than any syrup. He said that while sprays work better than over-the-counter medications, parents should use them for only a few days. Otherwise, they risk damaging the nasal passages. He said the time to really start taking note of symptoms is when a child stops eating regularly, has a fever of higher than 101 or is no longer alert while awake. But even then, he said, call the pediatrician before going to an urgent care or emergency room. \u201cSo many times, the symptoms will worsen at night and the family feels like they don\u2019t have access to their normal doctor\u2019s office, but many pediatricians are happy to talk to parents over the phone during off hours,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThey can advise from off-site and make an appointment for the morning, which saves a lot of time and money on the part of the family. Remember, the pediatrician knows their patient better than an emergency room ever could.\u201d For us, the phone call wasn\u2019t an option late one night well into the third week. Suddenly, over dinner, one of my daughters could no longer breathe in without coughing continuously. Her lungs were so busy trying to expel whatever was irritating them that they were not allowing any intake of air. She seemed to be suffocating right in front of us. We raced her to the ER. They rushed us to the front of the line. Four X-rays, five hours and an intense nebulizer treatment later, she was breathing normally and sleeping on her cot with the rough ER blanket pulled around her shoulders. They sent us home with instructions to buy a nebulizer of our own, a prescription for antibiotics (just in case) and steroids to calm the inflammation. They told us to follow up with an allergist. This time the diagnosis was bronchospasms brought on by a virus brought on by allergies. But why, with all of our attention to the symptoms and all our care, had we not been able to prevent her distress from getting worse? We were at wits\u2019 end. And now we had $800 in medical bills and countless hours in waiting rooms, all for a diagnosis of \u201csorry, there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d My emergency room co-pays came to $150 each. The co-pays for doctor visits were $20 per daughter. Nebulizers aren\u2019t cheap, and the costs of over-the-counter medicines were steadily rising. Over the next week, we used the nebulizer often because the girls\u2019 lungs were so irritated they simply couldn\u2019t breathe without it. \u201cSometimes when a virus gets into the lower airways, those airways become narrowed, and the patients wheeze,\u201d Brady said. \u201cBut even under those circumstances, unless they have the flu, there is no specific therapy that can treat the virus. You can only treat the symptoms.\u201d Brady said that when a virus starts growing in the upper respiratory tract \u2014 meaning the nose and throat \u2014 most of the time it ends there. Sometimes, however, it moves into the lower airways. It infects the top layers of cells and kills them. Because those are the cells that clean out the lungs, patients begin to cough, and that coughing inflames the lungs. And there is nothing you can do about it. \u201cParents truly need to know that there is nothing they can do to stop this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cA virus is going to run its course, no matter what. Treat the symptoms like wheezing and fever early, but understand that you didn\u2019t cause your child to get worse, and you can\u2019t help your child get better.\u201d Here\u2019s what I have learned if this ever happens again. Instead of focusing on stopping the entire thing immediately, I will pay closer attention to the smaller signs and what they mean. Instead of flooding my daughters with cough syrup, I will listen. Does it sound as if it\u2019s moving into their lungs? Are they starting to wheeze or crackle at all? At those signs, I will act, getting the medication and treatments we need to help those airways stay clear and avoid the near-shutdown of the lungs we experienced this time. By going to the doctor less but paying more attention, we could save ourselves a lot of money and a lot of heartache. As for this time, we followed up with an allergist, two months later \u2014 a visit with a price tag of $250. The kicker? My girls don\u2019t have allergies. They had a $1,000 cough. **Read more:** She thought it was only a 24-hour bug. What she really had almost killed her.", "Title: This woman\u2019s labored breathing alarmed her friends. Doctors were startled to find the cause. Content: \u201cWhat\u2019s _wrong_ with you?\u201d Dianne Hull remembered her friend Vicky Weinstein asking, alarm evident in her voice. The two women had just finished lunch in December 2012, and Hull breathed heavily as she walked across the kitchen of her friend\u2019s home. Hull\u2019s audible breathing \u2014 and increasing breathlessness \u2014 had been shoved aside in her constellation of pressing concerns. For months, Hull had been focused on a medical crisis affecting her young son. But now Weinstein \u2014 a nurse \u2014 was delivering a forceful reminder: It was past time for Hull, then 38, to pay attention to her own health. After Hull left that day, Weinstein, unconvinced that Hull would heed her warning, picked up the phone. \u201cYou have to do something,\u201d Weinstein told her husband, Philadelphia lung specialist Michael Weinstein. \u201cSomething is really wrong with Dianne.\u201d A month later, after Michael Weinstein\u2019s intercession, Hull\u2019s unusual and rare problem was diagnosed and treated. Nine months after that, she ran her first 5K race with no problem. \u201cIt was very frustrating, because for more than a year, nobody could really figure out what was wrong,\u201d Hull said, which made her symptoms easier to ignore once her son got sick. \u201cI needed people to say, \u2018Something\u2019s really not right.\u2019 \u201d During a routine appointment in July 2011, Hull\u2019s primary-care doctor remarked that she seemed slightly short of breath. Hull, who lives in Swarthmore, Pa., and works in the career services department at the University of Pennsylvania, said she didn\u2019t think much about it, especially because the doctor didn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cAt that point it had probably been going on for a few years,\u201d Hull recalled. Although she exercised regularly, Hull was pushing 40. Maybe, she thought, she needed to step it up athletically. A month later, she mentioned the problem to Weinstein\u2019s husband, Michael, whom Hull had known since college. He suggested she come to his office. Michael Weinstein did not detect wheezing, but he thought Hull might have developed exercise-induced asthma, which is not uncommon in middle age. He suggested she try using inhalers and an antihistamine before exercising. Over the next year, Hull said, she periodically tried the medicines but noticed no difference. She had never smoked and took Jazzercise classes, walked and swam regularly \u2014 but noticed that increasingly she felt winded even when she exerted herself only mildly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t walk up a flight of stairs and talk on the phone at the same time,\u201d Hull recalled. In July 2012, she caught strep throat from her young daughter and saw her internist. \u201cDo you always wheeze?\u201d Hull remembers her doctor asking. She told Hull she should have a chest X-ray and lung function tests after she recovered from strep. Wheezing can be a sign of an obstruction, asthma or vocal cord dysfunction. The tests, performed a month later, were normal. Hull said the most notable aspect was the attitude of the technician who \u201cimplied there was nothing wrong with my breathing and it was all in my head.\u201d But Hull noticed that whenever she swam her customary 50 laps, she needed to stop after each to catch her breath. Weinstein was puzzled because he had thought the tests would indicate that Hull had asthma. He urged Hull to schedule the gold standard of asthma tests: a methacholine challenge, which evaluates how the lungs react to inhaled substances. A negative test is believed to definitively rule out asthma. Hull scheduled the test. Before it could be performed, her attention was commandeered by a far more pressing problem: Her 7-year-old son was hospitalized with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes, and managing his disease became the primary focus of Hull and her husband. \u201cAny concern about my breathing just sort of went away,\u201d recalled Hull, who canceled the test. \u201cI had two kids and I was overwhelmed. There was no time for me to be sick.\u201d Several months later, Hull\u2019s son had stabilized, but her breathing had worsened dramatically. She cleared her throat continously, coughed frequently and struggled through exercise classes; her breathing sounded like a high- pitched whistle. Her primary-care doctor told her she had stridor, an abnormal high-pitched sound that typically indicates a partially blocked airway. The doctor suggested allergy testing. \u201cI was confident I didn\u2019t have allergies,\u201d Hull said, but scheduled an appointment for January. A few weeks later, she had lunch with Vicky Weinstein. At his wife\u2019s urging, Michael Weinstein called Hull, who told him about her upcoming appointment with the allergist. The allergist was extremely thorough \u2014 and visibly alarmed, Hull said. He agreed that something was seriously wrong with her breathing and sent her down the hall for another round of lung function tests, which were normal. He then placed his stethoscope on Hull\u2019s throat, not over her lungs. When she breathed, she recalled, he \u201crecoiled, with a scared look on his face.\u201d \u201cNot what you want to see,\u201d she remembers. She asked the doctor what he had heard, and he told her he thought there might be an obstruction in her throat. \u201cA tumor?\u201d she remembers asking. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the allergist replied, kindly putting a hand on her shoulder. He referred Hull to an ear, nose and throat specialist, and called on her behalf for an expedited appointment. The ENT, Hull said, was the polar opposite of the allergist: a brusque man of few words and even less reassurance. He told Hull he didn\u2019t know what was wrong but that she needed a CT scan and possibly a bronchoscopy, a procedure that enables a doctor to inspect a patient\u2019s airway using a flexible scope. He told Hull he suspected that her problem was not a tumor, but more likely paradoxical vocal cords, which open in the wrong way. He gave her an order for a CT scan. Uncertain about what this meant, or what to do next, Hull turned to Weinstein. To Weinstein, the paradoxical vocal cord hypothesis was puzzling. It didn\u2019t explain the stridor, which was his greatest concern. In adults, stridor is often caused by trauma to the airway from a breathing tube or smoke inhalation, but Hull hadn\u2019t experienced either of these things. Nor did she appear to have a tumor or obstruction. Way down on the list of possible causes of stridor, Weinstein said, was a very rare disorder called subglottic tracheal stenosis. For reasons that are unclear, nearly all of those affected are white women between the ages of 30 and 50. The disorder involves a narrowing of the windpipe just below the vocal cords. If there is no known cause \u2014 as occurs in about 15 percent of cases \u2014 the condition is deemed idiopathic. The incidence and prevalence of the disorder is not known. Cases are often misdiagnosed as asthma or, less often, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is no specific test for the disorder, but the narrowing can be seen on a CT scan of the neck. Medications and surgery have been used to treat the stenosis, but because the condition is so rare, it isn\u2019t known what works best. Weinstein told Hull that he suspected she had subglottic stenosis, although he had never seen a case. When he saw the CT scan order, he noticed it was for a lung CT, not a neck scan, and intervened to have the order changed. He also referred Hull to an interventional pulmonologist at Penn\u2019s Lung Center who specializes in treating subglottic stenosis. Hull said she was told that Penn sees about 10 cases annually. The scan showed what Weinstein suspected: a narrowing of Hull\u2019s trachea. The pulmonologist confirmed the diagnosis. He said \u201cI was essentially breathing through a straw,\u201d Hull said. \u201cBut it was such a relief for someone to say what was wrong.\u201d A month later, Hull underwent a bronchial dilation, which involves expanding the airway, often through use of a balloon. More-severe cases and those that don\u2019t respond to dilation may involve delicate and difficult surgery to remove the diseased sections and reconnect the trachea. Some patients require multiple dilations, while others need only a single procedure. \u201cThe more narrow the neck gets, it\u2019s harder to dilate,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThen you need a resection, which is a very big operation.\u201d Hull said the procedure restored her trachea to about 90 percent functioning \u201cwhich is good enough for me.\u201d So far, she said, she has not needed a second procedure, although she knows from online patient groups that this remains a possibility. \u201cThe first year out, there was a lot of anxiety,\u201d she said, wondering if the procedure would work. \u201cI know there are people who\u2019ve had 12 of these\u201d dilations. In addition to coughing and clearing her throat more often than normal, Hull said she notices that colds linger. Recovery from the last one took three weeks. Hull said she is especially grateful to her friend for helping to manage her case and steering her to the right expert. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky I know Mike,\u201d she said. To Weinstein, Hull\u2019s experience illustrates the importance of persistence. Most people with symptoms like Hull\u2019s have asthma and \u201cget treated and feel better,\u201d he said. But when that doesn\u2019t happen, \u201cit\u2019s important to stay on it until you get an answer.\u201d Submit your solved medical mystery to sandra.boodman@washpost.com. No unsolved cases, please.

However, it\u2019s __ one of those shows that was so packed with plot that if you haven\u2019t watched it in almost a year, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be very lost during the upcoming premiere. *[WSU]: Wayne State University _[RELATED: Hank Stuever reviews the new season of \u201cOrphan Black\"]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University If you don\u2019t have time to read lengthy, in-depth recaps, theories and explanations about genetic coding, or thinkpieces about why Tatiana Maslany _really_ deserves the Emmy, here\u2019s a quick look at everything you probably forgot from last year that you\u2019ll need to remember for Season 2. Or, if you\u2019re a newcomer to the show, consider this to be the basic summary that can get you somewhat up to speed. *[WSU]: Wayne State University (Season 2 trailer) *[WSU]: Wayne State University **THE GIST** *[WSU]: Wayne State University Sarah Manning (Canadian actress Tatiana Maslany) was just your average British grifter living in unidentified-North-American-city-that\u2019s-probably-Toronto until a chance encounter on the subway platform with a woman who looked exactly like her \u2014 then she watched as the woman committed suicide by walking into the path of an oncoming train. Sarah grabbed the woman\u2019s purse and then proceeded to steal the woman\u2019s identity, and got ready to clean out her bank accounts and go on the run with her young daughter, Kira, and foster brother, Felix. That is until Sarah learned the woman, named Beth Childs, was more than just a doppelganger; and that Sarah herself (along with at least nine others, all played by Maslany) was part of a clone experiment gone awry. Actually, from the perspective of the clone creators, it didn\u2019t really go awry until someone started trying to kill off all the clones. For a while, things were just great: We were introduced to \u201cneolution\u201d specialist Dr. Aldous Leekie, part of the mysterious Dyad Institute (a big believer in \u201cself-directed evolution\u201d), who is behind the cloning experiment. Dr. Leekie put the clones in various spots across the world, but kept careful tabs on them. He assigned a monitor to each subject, someone that would report on the clone\u2019s behavior \u2014 and let doctors perform illegal experiments and medical testing on them while they were asleep. Everything was going just fine until a group of anti-cloning religious extremists who hate science (known as the Prolethians, led by a guy named Tomas) captured Helena, one of the clones living in Ukraine. They brainwashed Helena and told her that she was the \u201coriginal,\u201d and sent her on a killing spree against the other clones, convincing her that the clones were an abomination against society and they were not human. That\u2019s how Sarah got involved \u2014 when she took over Beth\u2019s life, she started getting calls from mysterious people asking if she \u201cgot the briefcase\u201d and other weird things. Turns out, those people were her fellow clones, Alison and Cosima, who were on a mission to find the clone killer and discover who was behind the clone experiment. Beth was a cop, and we\u2019re told that six months earlier she got a call from a clone, Katja, saying that her genetic identicals were being hunted across Europe. Using her police expertise, Beth used facial recognition software to find her other clones in North America (Alison and Cosima), and they teamed up to try and find the killer. Then Beth killed herself, and Sarah had to take her place as a police officer. Eventually, the new trio tracked down Helena, which was only made slightly more complicated by the fact that in the finale, Sarah\u2019s birth mother, Amelia, appeared and told her that Sarah and Helena were not just clones, but twins separated at birth. But after Helena put Sarah\u2019s daughter in danger, Sarah wound up shooting her, anyway. While that was going on, Dr. Leekie and his mysterious colleague, Rachel Duncan (yet another clone) were trying to convince all the remaining clones (Sarah, Alison, Cosima) to sign papers that would \u201crelease\u201d them from being monitored by the institute, provided they come in for yearly medical testing. Alison signed. Sarah didn\u2019t, and arrived home to find her daughter and foster mother, Mrs. S., had disappeared. Cosima didn\u2019t sign, but discovered the papers were all a lie; because Dr. Leekie had put a patent on the clones, they were all his intellectual property and he technically owns them. (See below for more lingering questions from the finale.) **THE CLONES, ranked from alive to dead** *[WSU]: Wayne State University Sarah Manning, U.K.: (Alive) The main character clone who took over Beth Childs\u2019s life, is by far the most mysterious because she has a daughter \u2014 and clones can\u2019t reproduce. Or can they? We don\u2019t really know the identity of Sarah\u2019s monitor, but when she took over Beth\u2019s life, it was Beth\u2019s boyfriend, Paul. Despite all odds in the insane situation, Sarah and Paul have since hit it off and seem to have a tentative relationship. Cosima Niehaus, North America: (Alive) The \u201cscience geek\u201d getting her PhD, she handled the technical research part of the clone club. She ended up falling in love with her monitor, Delphine, who was only using her to steal information to give to Dr. Leekie. Cosima wound up heartbroken, and was also coughing up blood in the finale. Alison Hendrix, North America: (Alive) The pill-popping, heavy drinking soccer mom became considerably less uptight last year when she banded together with her other clones, and went on a self-destructive bender at the end of the season. Unbeknownst to Alison, her monitor is actually her seemingly simple husband, Donnie. Rachel Duncan, North America: (Alive) We don\u2019t know much about Rachel except that she\u2019s \u201cpro-clone\u201d and works closely with Dr. Leekie, and very much believes in the neolution and cloning experiments. She may have also kidnapped Sarah\u2019s daughter and foster mother, but that is unclear. Helena, Ukraine: (Dead) The craziest and scariest clone of all, Helena was raised in a Ukranian orphanage and adopted by religious brain-washing extremists, so she never really had a chance. Still, she murdered a bunch of clones, so it\u2019s a relief that she can\u2019t do any more damage. She did have some good one-liners, though. Elizabeth Childs, America: (Dead) She\u2019s the cop who had her identity taken over by Sarah Manning. After killing Maggie Chen \u2014 a Prolethian who infiltrated Dr. Leekie\u2019s ranks and was on a mission to kill the clones \u2014 Beth couldn\u2019t take the madness anymore, so she killed herself. Her monitor was her boyfriend Paul (see above), who helped with some illegal contract killing in Afghanistan during his time in the military, and was being blackmailed by Dr. Leekie to be involved in his operation. Katja Obinger, Germany: (Dead) Showed up briefly in the first episode to deliver information on her fellow European clones to Beth, only to be shot in the head by Helena. Janika Zingler, Austria: (Dead) Never met her, presumably killed by Helena. Danielle Fournier, France: (Dead) Ditto. Aryanna Giordano, Italy: (Dead) Ditto. **LINGERING QUESTIONS FROM THE SEASON 1 FINALE** *[WSU]: Wayne State University _What happened to Kira and Mrs. S?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University The season ended as Sarah refused to sign Dr. Leekie\u2019s \u201cpeace treaty\u201d and subject herself to voluntary medical testing for clones in exchange for freedom. After sending an e-mail to Dr. Leekie\u2019s colleague/her clone Rachel Duncan that said \u201cUP YOURS, PRO-CLONE,\u201d she arrived home to find the house ransacked and that Kira and Mrs. S., had disappeared. Was it Rachel? Was it Mrs. S., who started to grow increasingly mysterious as the season went on, refusing to tell Sarah anything about her past? _What was Amelia about to say about Sarah\u2019s foster mom, Mrs. S?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University You know when characters say, \u201cI need to tell you something\u201d and then get interrupted or put it off until later and it\u2019s incredibly frustrating because obviously they\u2019ll get killed off before they get a chance to reveal the crucial information? That\u2019s exactly what happened to Amelia, the woman who had in vitro fertilization years ago and was impregnated with twins, Sarah and Helena. Amelia randomly showed up in the finale and promised Sarah she had important information to share about Sarah\u2019s foster mother, Mrs. S. She was about to spill all the details, but Helena (dressed in a Sarah wig) stabbed her first. _What is Project LEDA?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University The one clue Amelia managed to give was a mysterious photo dated 1977 that said \u201cProject LEDA\u201d \u2014 it showed two scientist-types in lab coats, but their names were blurred out. Expect to hear more about that this season. _What\u2019s up with the discovery that the clones are the intellectual property of Dr. Leekie?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University Doing research about her genetic material, Cosima discovered that Dr. Leekie had included a clause in the code that the clones were \u201crestricted intellectual property.\u201d Who knows if that\u2019s enforceable, but Cosima was especially horrified because that means that Leekie legally owns all of them, and by extension, Kira. _Is Cosima sick?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University There was chatter throughout the season that the German clone, Katja, was suffering from a respiratory disease before she was shot. While trying to gain more information about the clone genetic coding, Cosima also researched this \u2014 and then to her horror, started having coughing attacks where she hacked up blood. _What\u2019s going to happen with Alison after she watched Aynsley die?_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University Alison, who started out as an uptight suburban soccer mom, started to completely lose it as she grew especially paranoid about the identity of her monitor. At first, she assumed it was her sweet-but-dumb husband, Donnie, and tortured him with a hot glue gun trying to get him to confess. He swore it wasn\u2019t him, so Alison then assumed it was her busybody neighbor, Aynsley.

During the next 36 hours, 11 more cases were identified across Montgomery. Then one surfaced in Fairfax County. By the second week of school, Montgomery had 15 cases among students from 9 to 18 years old, in both public and private schools. What all but one of those cases had in common was a Jewish overnight camp popular with Washington-area families \u2014 Capital Camps \u2014 located near Waynesboro, Pa., roughly 60 miles from Rockville. After the camp\u2019s last session ended Aug. 10, camp officials learned that one teenage camper\u2019s cough was more troubling than they knew: It was diagnosed by a doctor as whooping cough, a highly contagious disease that often spreads through coughing and sneezing. The spate of cases has left Montgomery health officials working long hours to contain it. Letters have been sent home to parents at seven Montgomery public schools \u2014 most recently Walter Johnson High School in Bethesda \u2014 advising them to be on the lookout for symptoms. Whooping cough, or pertussis, begins with cold-like symptoms, but it can lead to coughing fits that include a \u201cwhoop\u201d sound at the end. Though treatable with antibiotics, the illness is most dangerous in infants and those with weak immune systems. Most children are vaccinated as infants, and a booster is recommended at age 11 or 12. Nationally, whooping cough has been on the rise in recent years. This year, there have been more than 17,300 cases reported, a 30 percent increase compared with the same time a year ago, according to figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Alison Albert of the CDC said the disease is cyclical, with cases rising and falling, but noted that the recent increase might be the result of increased diagnosis and reporting or a move in the 1990s to a safer vaccination that might not be protective as long. She said research is underway on the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness with a new strain of pertussis that health officials have seen in the past few years. Albert said the outbreak related to the Pennsylvania camp does not appear surprising. The disease is not uncommon, she said, and vaccinations don\u2019t provide endless protection. \u201cThe sooner we get on top of these, the better we can limit the spread,\u201d said Ulder Tillman, Montgomery County\u2019s health officer, who urged parents of students starting seventh grade to make sure they have received a Tdap booster, which includes a vaccination against whooping cough. Maryland now requires the booster for all children in public and private schools. Capital Camps chief executive Jonah Geller said immunizations are required for campers to attend the camp and said the camp was quick to follow the guidance of health authorities as soon as the diagnosis was made. \u201cWe care very deeply about the health and safety of every single camper and every single staff member,\u201d Geller said. Montgomery health officials confirmed last week that all of the campers who developed whooping cough were vaccinated against it. That they fell ill anyway is likely a reflection of the waning of protections from previous immunizations, which means students in school with those who were infected could still be at risk. The health department has not identified any cases spread by campers after they returned from camp. But those vaccinations are important in any case, health officials said. \u201cIt may have kept these kids from getting any sicker,\u201d said Cindy Edwards, senior nurse administrator for communicable disease and epidemiology with Montgomery\u2019s health department. Montgomery had 40 whooping cough cases last year, but health officials in Montgomery and in the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said they could not recall the last outbreak of associated cases. \u201cThis is probably the first one we\u2019ve had in a while, in terms of a number of cases associated with a specific event,\u201d said Kurt Seetoo, immunization epidemiologist at the state health department. At Capital Camps, based in Rockville, Geller said perhaps 50 percent of the 1,000 summer campers each year come from the Washington region, many of them from Montgomery. The student who was diagnosed with the disease saw the camp\u2019s medical staff but did not show signs of whooping cough then, Geller said. A Montgomery County father whose daughter developed the illness said the cough surfaced a week after camp ended. It sounded bad, he said, but at first no one \u2014 including the family\u2019s doctor \u2014 thought of whooping cough because they did not know of any possible exposure. That changed after Aug. 25, when the family received an e-mail from the camp, which forwarded a letter from Pennsylvania health officials. The family\u2019s doctor then did a test, which turned out positive. Right away, the girl stopped attending school \u2014 she had gone to classes for just one day \u2014 and started a course of antibiotics, said her father, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to protect the girl\u2019s privacy. She is now doing well, he said. Thinking back, he said, \u201cthe cough did have that weird sound to it, that whooping sound.\u201d The father said he does not blame the camp. \u201cIt\u2019s something that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are going to be sick. It could have happened anywhere.\u201d The whooping cough case in Fairfax involved a student at Gesher Jewish Day School, which started classes Tuesday, eight days after Montgomery. By then, the student had been treated and was not contagious, said school spokeswoman Lisa Stern. Stern said parents were notified. About a dozen of the school\u2019s students attended the camp, and no one else was diagnosed, she said. \u201cWe were fortunate in that it all came about before school started,\u201d she said. Other Washington-area public school systems said they had not seen cases of whooping cough this school year, including in Alexandria and Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince George\u2019s and Prince William counties. D.C. health officials have not seen a camp-associated outbreak and have had 12 cases since January. In Montgomery and other areas, immunization clinics have been held to help get students vaccinated. Montgomery\u2019s clinics will continue this week, as a deadline of Sept. 12 approaches to show proof of vaccinations."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "The passage discusses medical mysteries and the process of diagnosing complex cases.

The overall birthrate decreased by 8 percent between 2007 and 2010, with a much bigger drop of 14 percent among foreign-born women. The overall birthrate is at its lowest since 1920, the earliest year with reliable records. The 2011 figures don\u2019t have breakdowns for immigrants yet, but the preliminary findings indicate that they will follow the same trend. The decline could have far-reaching implications for U.S. economic and social policy. A continuing decrease could challenge long-held assumptions that births to immigrants will help maintain the U.S. population and create the taxpaying workforce needed to support the aging baby-boom generation. The U.S. birthrate \u2014 63.2 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age \u2014 has fallen to a little more than half of its peak, which was in 1957. The rate among foreign-born women, who have tended to have bigger families, has also been declining in recent decades, although more slowly, according to the report. But after 2007, as the worst recession in decades dried up jobs and economic prospects across the nation, the birthrate for immigrant women plunged. One of the most dramatic drops was among Mexican immigrants \u2014 23 percent. The fall didn\u2019t occur because there are fewer immigrant women of childbearing age but because of a change in their behavior, said D\u2019Vera Cohn, an author of the report, which uses data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. Cohn added that \u201cthe economic downturn seems to play a pretty large role in the drop in the fertility rate.\u201d Although the declining U.S. birthrate has not created the kind of stark imbalances found in graying countries such as Japan or Italy, it should serve as a wake-up call for policymakers, said Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe\u2019ve been assuming that when the baby-boomer population gets most expensive, that there are going to be immigrants and their children who are going to be paying into [programs for the elderly], but in the wake of what\u2019s happened in the last five years, we have to reexamine those assumptions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you think of things like the solvency of Social Security, for example . . . relatively small increases in the dependency ratio can have a huge effect.\u201d The average number of children a U.S. woman is predicted to have in her lifetime is 1.9, slightly less than the 2.1 children required to maintain current population levels. The falling birthrate mirrors what has happened during other recessions. A Pew study last year found that the current decline in U.S. fertility rates was closely linked to hard times, particularly among Hispanics. \u201cThe economy can have an impact on these long-term trends, and even the immigrants that we have been counting on to boost our population growth can dip in a poor economy,\u201d said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. He noted that Hispanic women, who led the decline, occupy one of the country\u2019s most economically vulnerable groups. Historically, once the economy rebounds after a recession, so does the birthrate, Cohn said. But other factors may also be affecting the decline and may not change much once the economy recovers. Almost half of all immigrants to the United States are of Hispanic origin. But in recent years, immigration from Mexico, the biggest contributing country, has dried up; for the first time since the Great Depression, the net migration from Mexico has been zero. Latino immigrants who have been here longer tend to adopt U.S. attitudes and behavior, including having smaller families, Suro said. He added that the decline in the birthrate among Mexican immigrants is probably so sharp because the rate was so high that there was more room for it to fall. Although the Hispanic birthrate may never return to its highest levels, immigrants who have babies will probably continue to boost overall fertility rates, said Frey, who considers the current decline a \u201cshort-term blip.\u201d Immigrants from Asia, he said, continue to move to the United States, although their birthrates are not likely to approach that of Hispanic immigrants at their peak. The recent birthrate decline among Latino women may also be related to enhanced access to emergency contraception and better sex education in recent years, said Kimberly Inez McGuire, a senior policy analyst at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health. At Mary\u2019s Center, an organization in the District that provides social services to low-income people, the waiting room on a recent morning was filled with immigrants, many with swollen bellies. But not all were planning large families. Elsa Mendez, 22, a single Guatemalan immigrant who lives in Petworth, is set to give birth to her first child in December, but she said that after this one, she plans to go on birth control because she wants a better life. \u201cSometimes [Hispanic] people \u2014 they have a lot of kids, and no talk about family planning,\u201d she said. \u201cI have neighbors who have nine kids \u2014 they come from El Salvador and are all together in the same room.\u201d But Mendez, a sales clerk, said she sees American families with fewer children and wants to emulate them. \u201cI want to have more money for her,\u201d she said, referring to her unborn child. Mindy Greenside, director of midwifery at Mary\u2019s Center, said many more immigrant women are asking about contraception than did so five years ago. One of them is Elizabeth Rosa, 37, a Salvadoran who lives in Langley Park. Pregnant with her third child, she said it will be her last. \u201cTo have more babies, it costs more,\u201d she said as her 2-year-old son Emanuel played nearby. Pointing to her belly, she said she plans to have her tubes tied after giving birth. \u201cThe factory is closing,\u201d she said with a smile.", "Title: Teen birthrate is higher in small U.S. towns than in cities Content: The teen birthrate in America\u2019s small towns is 63 percent higher than in its biggest cities, a new government report reveals. In 2015, there were 18.9 births for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 19 living in counties with large urban areas, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That compares with 30.9 births per 1,000 women in the same age group who lived in rural counties, the report said. In between were counties with small- and medium-size cities and suburbs. There, the birthrate was 24.3 babies per 1,000 women ages 15 to 19. Although the teen birthrate varied widely among cities, towns and hamlets, municipalities of all sizes had one thing in common: All experienced steady declines between 2007 and 2015, federal data show. Large urban counties recorded the biggest drop over those eight years. In 2007, the birthrate for 15-to-19-year-olds was 38.1 per 1,000 women. It has since plunged by 50 percent. Next came counties with smaller urban areas, where the teen birthrate is now 44 percent lower than the 43.1-per-1,000 rate seen in 2007. Rural counties started out with the highest birthrate \u2014 49.1 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 19 \u2014 and saw it fall 37 percent over eight years. Here\u2019s another way to appreciate the change: Urban counties in every state (along with the District) recorded a decline in the teen birthrate between 2007 and 2015. In 17 states, the rate in urban areas was cut at least in half. These states included Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Likewise, the teen birthrate for rural counties fell in all 46 states that reported reliable data. Two states \u2014 Colorado and Connecticut \u2014 recorded a decline of at least 50 percent between 2007 and 2015. (New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District do not include any rural counties.) Across racial and ethnic groups, the researchers consistently found that the more urban a county, the lower the teen birthrate. For non-Latina white women, the 2015 teen birthrate in rural counties (26.8 per 1,000) was 2.5 times as high as the rate in large urban counties (10.5 per 1,000). For non-Latina black women, the rate in rural counties (39.6 per 1,000) was 36 percent higher than in large urban counties (29.1 per 1,000). And for Latina teens, the birthrate in rural counties (47 per 1,000) was 50 percent greater than in large urban counties (31.4 per 1,000), according to the report. The authors of the report don\u2019t know why the teen birthrate was lower \u2014 and falling faster \u2014 in large urban areas than in rural ones. They did not study abortion rates between 2007 and 2015, nor did they examine whether schools in some counties were more or less likely to promote the use of birth control or abstinence. The study was based on data collected by the National Vital Statistics System and from the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme.", "Title: The U.S. fertility rate just hit a historic low. Why some demographers are freaking out. Content: The United States is in the midst of what some worry is a baby crisis. The number of women giving birth has been declining for years and just hit a historic low. If the trend continues \u2014 and experts disagree on whether it will \u2014 the country could face economic and cultural turmoil. According to provisional 2016 population data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday, the number of births fell 1 percent from a year earlier, bringing the general fertility rate to 62.0 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. The trend is being driven by a decline in birthrates for teens and 20-somethings. The birthrate for women in their 30s and 40s increased \u2014 but not enough to make up for the lower numbers in their younger peers. A country's birthrate is among the most important measures of demographic health. The number needs to be within a certain range, called the \u201creplacement level,\u201d to keep a population stable so that it neither grows nor shrinks. If too low, there's a danger that we wouldn't be able to replace the aging workforce and have enough tax revenue to keep the economy stable. Countries such as France and Japan that have low birthrates have put pro-family policies into place to try to encourage couples to have babies. The flip side can also be a problem. Birthrates that are too high can strain resources such as clean water, food, shelter and social services, problems faced by India, where the fertility rate has fallen over the past few decades but still remains high. The debate now is about whether the United States is headed toward a \u201cnational emergency,\u201d as some have feared, or whether this is a blip and the birthrate will level off soon. \u201cIt's about millennials,\u201d says Donna M. Strobino, a professor of population, family and reproductive health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Those supposedly entitled young adults with fragile egos who live in their parents' basements and hop from job-to-job \u2014 it turns out they're also much less likely to have babies, at least so far. Some experts think millennials are just postponing parenthood while others fear they're choosing not to have children at all. Strobino is among those who is optimistic and sees hope in the data. She points out that the fall in birthrates in teens \u2014 an age when many pregnancies tend to be unplanned \u2014 is something we want and that the highest birthrates are now among women 25 to 34 years of age. \u201cWhat this is is a trend of women becoming more educated and more mature. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s bad,\u201d she explained. Indeed, as fertility treatments have extended the age of childbearing, the birthrates among women who are age 40 to 44 are also rising. Frey attributed the decline in birthrates to a women's \u201clifestyle\u201d choice as well as the fact the economy has been in a funk. Times of economic downturn or uncertainty tend to cause a drop in birthrates, but when things turn around they tend to bounce back in a kind of catch-up period.", "Title: Teenagers have never been a smaller portion of our population Content: As I was putting together the article about America's future demographics, I showed the last chart to a colleague. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"Whoa,\" she responded. \"Teen death.\" That's a bit strong, but the point is an interesting one: By 2050, teens (does that need a hashtag?) will make up a small percentage of the population.

Let's make the most of it.", "Title: The historic and uneven decline in teen births Content: New evidence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this morning points to the ongoing and significant drop in the U.S. teen birth rate over the past 2o-plus years. The birth rate for teenagers ages 15-19 was 26.6 births per 1,000 in 2013, down 57 percent from the rate of 61.8 births per 1,000 in 1991, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The CDC attributes the 20-year decline to decreased sexual activity among teens, as well as more frequent use of contraception. As you would imagine, this historic decline in the teen birth rate has looked differently across states, races and age. The CDC report highlights some important ways in how this decline hasn't played out quite evenly. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **The age difference** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The birth rates for the 10-14, 15-17 and 18-19 age brackets were all at record lows in 2013. The decline has been much greater though, for girls 15-17. The 12.3 birth per 1,000 rate for teens 15-17 fell 68 percent since 1991, compared to 50 percent for teens 18-19, whose rate is 47.3 births per 1,000. More recently, the decline in birth rates since 2007 has also been greater for the 15-17 group (43 percent compared to 34 percent). **Which groups have seen the biggest declines? ** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The teen birth rate has declined across all racial groups since 1991, but the steepest declines have been recorded among Asian-Pacific Islanders (64 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (63 percent). API teens currently have the lowest birth rate overall (9.7 per 1,000), while Hispanic teens have the highest rate among the racial groups (46.3 percent). Still, the rate for Hispanic teens has fallen the fastest since 2007 (39 percent), and the CDC notes that the birth rates across most racial and Hispanic ethnicity groups is narrowing, as the following chart shows: **Uneven declines across the states** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday States have taken different approaches to reducing teen births, with differing results. Every state has seen a decline since 1991, but rates continue to be lowest in the Northeastern states and higher in the South. New England states all had teen birth rates under 20 per 1,000, with New Hampshire's the lowest at 13.8. Eight states had rates above 40 per 1,000, with New Mexico recording the highest at 47.5. The District of Columbia joined four states in seeing declines of more than 60 percent since 1991. **The United States could do better** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The good news for America is somewhat tempered by the fact that our teen birth rate still ranks among some of the highest for developed countries. While countries like Denmark, Switzerland and Japan recorded teen birth rates under 5 per 1,000, the United States finds itself among seven of 31 countries highlighted by the CDC with rates exceeding 20 births per 1,000 teens. **What the U.S. progress means** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Though the United States lags behind other countries, the CDC says the progress made since 1991 has amounted to 4 million fewer teen births. Citing research from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, the CDC says this also saved taxpayers an estimated $12 billion alone in 2010 from costs associated with government-funded health care, child welfare and higher incarceration rates for the children of teen moms. And having fewer babies born to teen mothers, the CDC points out, is good for other reasons. Teen motherhood comes with a higher health risk for the baby, educational limits for the mother and limited resources, since about 90 percent of teen births are to unmarried mothers.

The life and death of this courageous reporter should serve as inspiration and prod to the Mexican government to undertake reforms needed to end the impunity that allows the country\u2019s lawlessness to flourish. Mr. Valdez, 50, was shot and killed at midday May 15 on a busy street in the northwest state of Sinaloa. Authorities said unidentified attackers fired 12 shots at his car. Sinaloa is a drug trafficking destination perhaps best known as the home of Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n; Mr. Valdez, a correspondent for La Jornada, co-founded a regional weekly newspaper there in 2003 because of his belief in the need for honest reporting of the crime and corruption that victimize Mexicans \u2014 despite the risks. He is the sixth journalist to be killed in Mexico this year and one of more than 100 journalists who have been murdered since 2000. Eleven days before Mr. Valdez\u2019s death, a delegation from the Committee to Protect Journalists met with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to present its newly released report \u201cNo Excuse: Mexico Must Break Cycle of Impunity in Journalists\u2019 Murders.\u201d Among the recommendations were better protections for at-risk journalists, timely investigation of threats and training prosecutors in how to pursue crimes against freedom of expression. It\u2019s good that Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto immediately and strongly condemned Mr. Valdez\u2019s murder, but that is clearly not enough. Recommendations of the CPJ report should be embraced, and the chronic failure of the judicial system in investigating and prosecuting crimes must be addressed. A good place to start is making a priority of finding those who shot Mr. Valdez and those who ordered it. **Read more:** Carl Gershman: Remembering a journalist who was killed for standing up to Putin Letters to the Editor: Journalists killed for dedication to the truth Aykan Erdemir and Cenk Sidar: Turkey\u2019s bizarre witch hunt against the media", "Title: Being a journalist in Mexico is getting even more dangerous Content: Anabel Flores, a 27-year-old mother of two toddlers, was kidnapped by armed men who stormed her house in the early hours of Feb. 7 in the Mexican city of Orizaba, state of Veracruz. The facts are dramatic, but it\u2019s also an old story: Flores was a reporter, and her fate was similar to that suffered by more than 100 journalists in the past 15 years. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Her body was found two days later, on the evening of Feb. 9. Like many of her slain colleagues, Flores covered the crime beat. And in the state of Veracruz, one of the most violent in Mexico, fraught with violence by drug cartels, this is a high-risk job. Her death was another chilling reminder that a kidnapping almost surely means death for a Mexican journalist. It is a trend that Mexico shares with Middle Eastern countries such as Iraq and Syria, also among the world\u2019s most dangerous places for journalists, where the murder of American reporters Jim Foley and Steve Sotloff at the hands of the Islamic State let the world know that a kidnapping is more likely to end in death than release. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In Mexico, this has been the case in more than half of the 17 murders of journalists since 2014, as documented by the Journalists at Risk project supported by ICFJ and Freedom House. Nine of those 17 reporters, editors or news anchors were kidnapped before being killed. Their bodies were found after their abductions had been reported, and in all cases the authorities launched search operations. But the final, tragic outcomes prove that the government\u2019s response, at both the local and national level, is woefully inadequate. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Journalists have been missing for days before their bodies are found. When Flores was kidnapped, the Veracruz state government announced an operation to look for her. It didn\u2019t work, and she was found dead two days later. The authorities can be even more clueless, as evidenced by the case of Mois\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez, also in Veracruz. He was kidnapped in the town of Medell\u00edn on Jan. 2, 2015, and according to police reports, he was killed the same day. However, authorities took 22 days to find his body \u2014 even though they had several suspects in custody who had admitted the crime. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Those are just the cases in which a homicide could be determined. In addition to those nine kidnappings that resulted in death in the past two years, two more journalists remain missing after being abducted. Mar\u00eda del Rosario Fuentes, a blogger in the state of Tamaulipas, was last seen in October 2014. She was presumed dead after pictures of what appeared to be her body circulated in her social media accounts, but her remains have not been found. Mario Crespo Ay\u00f3n disappeared in the state of Sinaloa in December 2014 and did not leave a trace. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico All told, 11 journalists who were kidnapped in Mexico in the past two years are either dead or still missing. Only five journalists kidnapped in the same period were lucky enough to be released. The problem of missing journalists is not new. The organization Article19 has documented 23 disappearances since 2003. \u201cMexico is the country with more missing journalists in the world. A disappearance represents a continuing crime and a sign of despair in the pursuit of justice,\u201d says Dario Ramirez, Article19\u2019s director in Mexico. In the past 10 years, the Mexican government has created a special prosecutor for crimes against journalists, passed special laws federalizing those crimes and set up protection mechanisms for journalists at risk or under threat, measures that were implemented as attacks against the media grew at the turn of the decade. Since then, government officials and legislators routinely promise to improve the guarantees for a free press. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The result? The situation is worse. In 2005, the Mexican press was ranked \u201cPartly Free\u201d in an index by Freedom House that serves as a worldwide reference. In 2015, even after the creation of laws and institutions designed to \u201cprotect\u201d the press, Mexico was ranked \u201cNot Free.\u201d Mexican journalists are now less safe than ever, and as they struggle to protect themselves and form support networks, the response from authorities amount to no more than window dressing. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For example, the state where Flores\u2019s body was found already knew it had a problem. If Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, Veracruz is the most dangerous part of Mexico. In the past five years, 15 journalists have been killed there, and seven of the 17 Mexican journalists killed since 2014 were either murdered in or working in Veracruz. Four were killed there, and three others were murdered outside Veracruz but did their work there, including Rub\u00e9n Espinosa, who had fled for Mexico City, where he was killed last summer. Veracruz also accounts for three of the seven missing journalists since 2011. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Other southern states are almost as bad, though, such as Oaxaca, where six journalists have been killed since 2014, and Guerrero, where threats and attacks are frequent but not always reported. This means that violence against the media has shifted: In the early part of the decade, the northern states were the riskier places for journalists, mostly due to the violence unleashed by organized crime. Since then, as violence went down in the north, it went up in the south. More alarming, it\u2019s not just organized crime groups killing journalists in southern Mexico, as it was in the north. Attacks or arbitrary detentions of members of the media come from criminal groups, but also from government officials or security forces. The murder of Mois\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez is a case in point: Investigations alleged that his kidnapping was ordered by the mayor of Medell\u00edn, the town where S\u00e1nchez edited a small magazine, because he didn\u2019t like stories that appeared in La Uni\u00f3n, the magazine that S\u00e1nchez published. Officials in Veracruz say that the hit was carried out by criminals hired by the local police chief \u2014 a macabre form of \u201coutsourcing\u201d violence against journalists. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For years, Mexican journalists have known that stories about corruption, crime or violence can trigger tragic repercussions from those affected: drug cartel bosses, government officials, police chiefs. Violence has been unleashed on the Mexican media in an unprecedented scale, especially at the local level. Reporters and editors in small or medium cities are the most affected, and protection is absent. Impunity in crimes against journalists is rampant and it is the cause of every new aggression: Anyone who today plans to attack a journalist or news organization can do it because the ones that did it before got away with it. **Read more:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The drug cartel that protected Sean Penn also terrorizes other journalists *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Why I turned down an interview with \u201cEl Chapo\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Mexican state lawmakers want to censor bad news Content: Despite their notoriety as such, Mexico's drug cartels aren't really drug cartels. For one, they're too busy shooting and torturing each other to collude on the kind of price-fixing arrangement that would qualify them as a proper cartel. Nor do they deal exclusively in drugs. Over the years, many of the country's most feared criminal gangs have developed lucrative portfolios in human trafficking, kidnapping, oil bunkering and especially extortion. What's less known is that they're also big in the news business. In major border cities like Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa, the gangsters essentially edit the local news, which is to say, they censor it. Besieged residents of those places may witness a wild gun battle in broad daylight and see bodies splayed out in the streets, but when they pick up a newspaper the next day, they won't find a word about it. This was not achieved by a few threatening phone calls. Over the years, the gangsters murdered, kidnapped and ran off many of Mexico's best crime reporters. They attacked newspaper offices and television studios with bullets and grenades. And while the intimidation campaign has fallen hardest on local news reporters, gunmen have also attacked and killed correspondents from Mexico's major national media outlets. These efforts to silence and censor the news are a big reason that a new law in Sinaloa, one of Mexico's most violent states, has triggered a wave of outrage since its approval last week. State lawmakers voted for new restrictions that essentially limit reporters to covering crime and violence only after authorities have given their permission. Under the new law, reporters will be prohibited from taking pictures or filming at crime scenes, and must wait for official news releases until publishing or broadcasting their reports. It wasn't clear how the laws would be enforced and what would happen to journalists and broadcasters who don't wait for state officials to tell them what they can cover. \"Let's imagine someone has been chopped to pieces, and the press arrives and starts taking photos, and publishing them online and in the media -- all of that is offensive to the victim's family and others,\" said Sinaloa lawmaker Roque Chavez, telling local reporters that the measures would improve the integrity of the judicial process and protect the work of forensic teams. But Javier Valdez, the award-winning reporter and co-founder of the Sinaloa-based weekly Rio Doce, described the measures as a blatant attack on the press -- and one that reflects the thinking of a political class that would rather stop journalists from covering violence than stop the violence itself. \"They're more worried about the news coverage than reality,\" he said. \"Our reality is one of murder, corruption and complicity between authorities and organized crime, and they want to cover that up for the sake of tourism and investment.\" Due to take effect Oct. 15, Sinaloa's new reporting restrictions have been condemned by press freedom organizations in Mexico and abroad. Mexico's National Human Rights Commissioner Raul Plascencia called it \"a bad precedent\" for freedom of speech. They are particularly galling for the Mexican journalists who have risked their lives to report on the country's criminal organizations, and who have been urging lawmakers to provide them with more protections -- not new obstacles. Mexico ranked seventh this year on the \"Global Impunity\" index of countries where killings against journalists go unpunished -- the worst rating in the hemisphere -- according to an annual survey by the Committee to Protect Journalists. After several dozen reporters staged a protest Monday in Culiacan, the state capital, Sinaloa governor Mario L\u00f3pez Valdez said he would meet with them and that the new legislation had been poorly drafted. The backlash against Sinaloa's state legislators has been so intense that lawmakers said they will introduce a new proposal Aug. 21 to repeal the measures, blaming its approval on a busy agenda that didn't leave enough time for the fine print. But Riodoce's Valdez said he's still skeptical. \"We can't let our guard down,\" he said, speaking by phone from Sinaloa. Of course, not all Mexican reporters are noble crusaders for truth and justice. Some take money in exchange for favorable coverage, or no coverage at all. Carnage-crazed tabloids tend to outnumber serious news outlets. Yet Mexico remains a country with a fairly vibrant and mostly-free press, and one that has hung on through a dark and scary era when powerful forces from the underworld and the political world have wanted to gag it. There were times in Ciudad Juarez in 2010 and 2011, when the city was at its deadliest, that it wasn't unusual for 10, 12 or 15 people to be slain in a single day. You could follow the local crime reporters to homicide scenes all around the city and see the bodies in the streets where they fell. These reporters and photographers followed the police radio traffic and paid cops and others for tips, wanting to arrive first so they could get close-ups of the dead before the forensic teams got there and sealed off the area with tape. Showing up at homicide scenes too early carried its own risks, especially when the police hadn't arrived yet and it wasn't clear whether the killing was finished. Gunmen would sometimes circle back to finish off the wounded. Still, I never saw reporters get in the way or interfere with a crime scene. More importantly, I know that if they hadn't been there at all, there would be no way to know whether the deaths would be noted, documented and tallied, or if they'd be simply cleaned up and concealed, as if nothing ever happened, as some would have preferred."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the murder of a well-known journalist in Mexico, which aligns with the query.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most comprehensive information about the risks faced by journalists in Mexico.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The life and death of this courageous reporter should serve as inspiration and prod to the Mexican government to undertake reforms needed to end the impunity that allows the country\u2019s lawlessness to flourish."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the dangers faced by journalists in Mexico, including kidnapping and murder.", "listwise_reason": "While it provides relevant information, it is less specific than passage 3 about the murder of a well-known journalist.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Her death was another chilling reminder that a kidnapping almost surely means death for a Mexican journalist."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the censorship and threats faced by journalists in Mexico.", "listwise_reason": "Although it provides relevant context, it does not directly address the murder of a well-known journalist.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Over the years, the gangsters murdered, kidnapped and ran off many of Mexico's best crime reporters."}, {"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the interaction of a famous actor with a drug cartel, but only tangentially mentions the risks faced by journalists in Mexico.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides less relevant information about the risks faced by journalists in Mexico.", "direct_answer_sentence": "For Mexican journalists, the interview can be painful."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage is identical to passage 1 and thus shares the same relevance and reasoning.", "listwise_reason": "As with passage 1, this passage provides less relevant information about the risks faced by journalists in Mexico.", "direct_answer_sentence": "For Mexican journalists, the interview can be painful."}]}, "scores": [11.406700134277344, 11.406699180603027, 10.937000274658203, 10.91819953918457, 10.039899826049805]}

A 70-page report issued this week by Inspector General Charles J. Willoughby said that Adult Protective Services rarely calls police to step in, even in cases involving physical abuse or misappropriation of money by a caretaker. \u201cThis lack of collaboration and coordination may put at risk the safety and well-being of APS clients and allow criminal activity to continue unabated,\u201d the report said. It does not cite specific examples of clients who were injured, died or had assets stolen after being brought to the attention of Adult Protective Services. Deputy Inspector General Blanche Bruce declined to provide more details, saying, \u201cThe report speaks for itself.\u201d APS has made no secret of not asking for much police help . In its annual report for 2007, a year when it opened 831 new cases, the agency said only two cases were reported to police one month. It said many clients, who have health problems and dementia, don\u2019t make great witnesses. It said the clients frequently don\u2019t want family members \u2014 even those who are abusing them \u2014 to be reported to police. Often they fear they will end up in a nursing home if their caretaker is arrested, according to the annual report, which was restated in the IG report. A spokesman for the Department of Human Services, which oversees APS, said the department is not aware of any clients who have been injured or abused further because of a lack of coordination with police. None of the deaths of 25 clients in the past year is a direct result of a lack of effort by the agency, said the spokesman, Reggie Sanders. APS has 20 employees, whose average caseload is 30 to 45 cases, Sanders said. The agency is clearly held in low esteem by many employees of other District agencies and nonprofit groups that are in frequent contact with it. When the inspector general sent out a questionnaire asking for impressions and observations, many of the comments were scathing. One licensed social worker, for example, wrote: \u201cAfter many years of being frustrated with the lack of responsiveness from APS, I have reached the point where I do not attempt to utilize their services [because] it has not proven to be a fruitful or worthwhile process.\u201d The inspector general, whose conclusions were first reported by the Washington Examiner, placed part of the blame on vague policies for interviewing clients and referring abuse to law enforcement. He said other cities and states, such as Virginia, give their employees much more explicit direction. As a result, the report said, individual caseworkers often interpret the policies differently. In general, the report painted a picture of an agency that is mired in bureaucracy and struggling to keep track of how it is doing. It noted that employees are not required to track client outcomes, and the last time senior management filed an annual report, as required under D.C. law, was for 2008. Sanders, the department spokesman, said APS stopped issuing annual reports when it was determined that a database was not reliable. It has since been redesigned, and the 2012 report should be issued within three months of the calendar year\u2019s end, he said. As an example of the agency\u2019s bulky bureaucracy, the report noted that early this year the staff had a cache of more than $64,000 in gift cards to Safeway and Target, for social workers to purchase food and household items for clients in need. It did not say whether any client was denied necessary staples but said they may be \u201cat risk\u201d if social workers don\u2019t present an adequate case on their behalf. In a footnote, the report outlined the complexity in obtaining a card. Social workers must fill out forms requesting a card, get a supervisor\u2019s approval and then submit it to another supervisor who manages the gift card program. The manager must photocopy the card for the social worker\u2019s signature. After a purchase, the social worker returns the card to the program manager, who contacts the merchant for verification. Sanders said less than $41,000 in gift cards are now in hand, and the complex process is in place to prevent their misuse. D.C. Council member Jim Graham (D-Ward 1) said that he found the report \u201castounding\u201d and that he had never heard complaints about the agency before. \u201cI think I and a lot of other people assumed there\u2019d be a really good working relationship between APS and [police],\u201d he said. \u201cThese are criminal activities. Why wouldn\u2019t there be something that ensured, as needed, police are involved? Wow. There\u2019s something very wrong here.\u201d But Graham said he was heartened by the agency\u2019s willingness to make corrections to its policies and procedures.", "Title: Elderly couple\u2019s $4 million suit accuses caregivers of major household theft Content: Sometimes Vera Mann sees an empty spot where a treasured object once sat, and her eyes fill with tears. The mantelpiece in her living room, which used to display crystal vases and porcelain figurines. Her light-filled atrium, where small marble animals peeked out from among the orchids. Her own fingers, where for 70 years she wore her wedding and engagement rings. All gone, now. Over the course of six months last year, she and her husband, David, say, three nurses caring for him in their Kalorama home systematically made off with more than half a million dollars\u2019 worth of their belongings. The Manns, both 91, have filed a $4 million civil suit against the nurses and two home health-care agencies, seeking compensation for the missing items \u2014 from bath towels to priceless family heirlooms \u2014 and for the distress it caused them. An investigation by D.C. police is also underway. The alleged disappearances, and the length of time over which they occurred, highlight a growing problem as more Americans age and require in-home care: The more dependent they are on caregivers, the harder it is to confront them when there is a problem. And crime allegations can be hard to prosecute if it\u2019s the word of the residents against that of the caregivers. A bill being considered in the District may help, making it a crime to use \u201cundue influence\u201d in the financial abuse of a vulnerable adult, including people 65 or older. Thirty-five states have statutes criminalizing the financial exploitation of older or incapacitated persons, and at least nine have laws defining undue influence in their criminal codes. The bill passed an initial D.C. Council vote last week, and the council expects to take a final vote this month or next. If it passes, advocates say it will make such cases easier to prosecute, particularly in situations involving coercion or in those in which it isn\u2019t clear whether a crime has been committed. The Manns\u2019 three-story D.C. townhouse, with a soaring, custom-built atrium that Vera hand-painted in Italian-style trompe l\u2019oeil, is filled with items collected over a lifetime of travel and overseas stints: He is a former assistant secretary of the Navy and she is a psychologist. The nurses were provided by Maryland-based Capital City Nurses, hired by their son in March 2015 after gastric bypass surgery left David in need of round-the-clock care. When small kitchen items began to vanish, the couple said they initially assumed they had been misplaced. But then the disappearances became more glaring, they said. A Limoges china planter. A silver fish platter. An expensive eelskin briefcase that hadn\u2019t left the house in 25 years. And finally, the couple said, jewelry and furs worth hundreds of thousands of dollars vanished, including pieces Vera\u2019s mother brought over from Russia around the time of the Titanic disaster. \u201cThose things, and the house itself as a safe environment that she had designed, were an important world to her, so to have a lot of the components of that world lost, to be invaded like that, was very traumatic for her,\u201d said their son, James Mann. For his father, he said, \u201cit\u2019s more a matter of a violation of trust, that people who came in on the basis of they were going to take care of him didn\u2019t do their job.\u201d By September, David was nailing boards across the kitchen cupboards and Vera was hiding valuables in locked rooms the caregivers were not supposed to enter. That didn\u2019t work \u2014 they allege that locked closets were forceably opened, and Vera said she awoke one night to find one of the caregivers in her bedroom, rummaging through boxes. When the Manns called Capital City Nurses to report what was happening, they said, they were not taken seriously. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh no, our people don\u2019t do such things,\u2019 \u201d David said. When they called the police on Sept. 17, their day caregiver stopped showing up for work, the couple said. The night caregiver had disappeared three weeks earlier without notice, a few days after seeing the boarded-up cupboards, the suit said. \u201cNone of them gave notice or resigned in any normal way; they just disappeared,\u201d said Charles Curlett, an attorney who last month filed the civil suit in D.C. Superior Court on the couple\u2019s behalf. A police spokesperson said Monday that the department\u2019s investigation is still active. Robert Grant, an attorney for Capital Health Care Associates, the agency originally listed in the suit, said, \u201cThe company is going to let the process play out in court, and beyond that we don\u2019t have any further comment at this time.\u201d Reached by phone, the night nurse named in the suit said the allegations were false. \u201cShe\u2019s making up stories,\u201d she said of Vera Mann. \u201cShe\u2019s not after me; she\u2019s after my insurance.\u201d The day nurse, reached by phone, said he was looking for an attorney and had no comment. A third nurse named in the suit, who the Manns said was sent by the agency intermittently, could not be reached by phone. No national database keeps track of fraud against older people, but an estimated 20 to 40 percent have experienced financial exploitation of some kind, and the cases are vastly underreported, said Kathy Greenlee, assistant secretary for aging at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. People 50 and older own 67 percent of bank deposits in the United States, according to a recent AARP report. \u201cSo they\u2019re more likely to be targets,\u201d Greenlee said. \u201cThe largest risk factor is dementia or cognitive impairment . . . but not having dementia is not a safe harbor.\u201d The most likely perpetrator is someone who is known and trusted, she said, noting that in many cases, caregivers view older people in a negative light and feel entitled to their money. Ageism can also influence how aggressively police and prosecutors pursue the cases. \u201cI think there\u2019s a perception in law enforcement that older adults can be unreliable,\u201d Greenlee said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fallacy that it\u2019s difficult to prosecute someone when the victim is old or frail or has some kind of cognitive impairment.\u201d In reality, the opposite can be true, said Paul Greenwood, a deputy district attorney and head of San Diego\u2019s elder abuse unit, who advised the District on the new bill. When an older person with cognitive impairment testifies, he said, \u201cI\u2019m secretly happy because the jury gets to see exactly why this victim was chosen, and if the defense attorney wants to cross examine, be my guest. . . . Jurors get it.\u201d Still, such cases can be hard to prosecute without evidence. As far as the Manns know, none of the missing items have been recovered. A search of local and federal courts found no criminal charges for the individual defendants, and no previous lawsuits for Capital City Nurses Healthcare Services or Capital Health Care Associates, under which they also do business. The nurses have no disciplinary history in the District, Maryland or Virginia. Another company was added last week as a defendant in the suit; the Manns\u2019 attorney said it has not yet been served. Even when there is no dementia, older people are more likely to question their own memory before blaming others. Vera can be a little forgetful about minor details but both are of sound mind, their son said, and David\u2019s caregivers were licensed nurses sent by an organization his hospital case worker had recommended. Older people also may be more reluctant to confront the people caring for them. In David\u2019s case, it had been hard to find people who were skilled at performing a difficult and painful daily procedure. \u201cTo me it was inconceivable that this man standing in front of me, taking care of things medically, would steal,\u201d David Mann said. Even when the Manns began to suspect the workers, \u201cNot wanting to experiment with new caregivers made it very awkward, so we just kept them on until we just couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\u201d When the Manns confronted the nurses, they did not admit to taking anything, but the day nurse \u201ctalked at length about his faith in God, and he told [Vera] how she would have a revelation and be rewarded in the Kingdom of Heaven for the good that her property would do in the hands of others,\u201d the suit alleges. The Manns\u2019 ordeal is not unusual, said Bob Blancato, national coordinator of the Elder Justice Coalition, who said he often hears similar stories **.** The fraud can go beyond pilfering belongings. \u201cSometimes the scammers or perpetrators detect the vulnerabilities [of the client] and the next thing you know they\u2019re changing wills and documents and shutting family members off altogether,\u201d Blancato said. The bill pending in the D.C. Council would help in situations such as the one alleged in the Manns\u2019 suit, said Amy Mix, supervising attorney for consumer fraud and financial abuse at AARP\u2019s Legal Counsel for the Elderly. \u201cThat activity to me screams undue influence,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re in\u00adcred\u00adibly dependent on these workers physically and emotionally.\u201d Some jurisdictions are more proactive than others about prosecuting cases of elder abuse, she said, noting that in Montgomery County, Adult Protective Services, detectives and prosecutors work in the same office on these cases and can easily communicate about them. A new coalition \u2013 the District\u2019s Collaborative Training & Response for Older Victims (DC TROV) \u2014 aims to improve the District\u2019s response with a multidisciplinary team of law enforcement, social services and advocates, and is providing elder-abuse training to police officers, detectives, prosecutors and judges. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia also offers regular presentations to educate the public about financial crimes against seniors. In general, before bringing a criminal case, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need evidence and we\u2019re going to need a witness who is able and willing to testify in court,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Virginia Cheatham. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to have someone who says, \u2018My mother didn\u2019t agree to this\u2019; we have to have the mother testify.\u201d In the absence of stolen goods, she said, evidence could include PayPal records or unexplained cash deposits to defendants\u2019 accounts. Curlett said he does not yet know how the case will proceed, but he said the Manns \u201cwould certainly be willing to testify if that\u2019s the right thing to do at that time.\u201d These days, David has a new caregiver and the thefts have stopped. But Vera still feels traumatized. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep in my bedroom since this happened,\u201d she said, adding that she and her husband have both lost weight and she still has nightmares. \u201cThey walked in and acted like it was Woolworth\u2019s.\u201d \u25cfEldercare Locator: www.eldercare.gov or 800-677-1116 \u25cfNational Center on Elder Abuse: www.ncea.aoa.gov \u25cfDepartment of Justice: www.justice.gov/elderjustice/ __", "Title: Ask Amy: Social butterfly embraces \u2018plus one\u2019 concept Content: _**Dear Amy:** My husband and I are in our mid-30s.

The answer broke their hearts. Content: The elderly man at the bus station was in good health, with a fresh haircut, clean nails and new clothes from a British department store \u2014 but he had no idea who or where he was. He had an American accent, but he was unable to tell authorities where he came from, who had brought him to Britain or how he had gotten to a bus station in Hereford, 150 miles northwest of London. Two men who said they saw him sitting at the station flagged down a passing ambulance, according to court documents. On that November morning in 2015, authorities thought they had encountered a man who had wandered away from a nearby nursing home. But after an investigation, they realized the man\u2019s sudden appearance in England stemmed from something more sinister. He was placed in a nursing home, where staff found his quiet, gentle demeanor endearing. He was trapped in his own world, but it appeared to be a peaceful one. Outside the care facility, authorities scrambled for clues to his identity. They scoured closed-circuit cameras, contacted Interpol, even ran his DNA through databases. Nothing. Ultimately, they made an appeal to the press, hoping the public could help crack the mystery. Finally, authorities had a name: Earl Roger Curry of Whittier, Calif., a married father of two adult children. The mystery was solved, but the solution sparked more questions. Chief among them: Why hadn\u2019t Curry\u2019s family tried to find him? That\u2019s when investigators began to home in on the family turmoil that landed Curry at a bus station in England. After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Curry had worked as a nurse with Kaiser Permanente. When he retired, he collected pension benefits from the company and Social Security benefits from the U.S. government, along with his veteran\u2019s benefits. But Curry had Alzheimer\u2019s, according to court documents, and his declining mental state required around-the-clock care. His disease left him unable to focus on people talking to him, let alone make decisions about his health or finances. A will that he took out in better days gave his wife durable power of attorney. But she was ailing, too. Court documents say she developed Parkinson\u2019s disease. So Curry\u2019s medical records also listed other responsible family members: his daughter, his wife's first cousin, his brother-in-law. Not mentioned in any of the documents was Kevin Curry, the couple\u2019s only son \u2014 and the one who ended up taking care of them. Authorities are still trying to piece together what happened as Roger Curry\u2019s mental faculties declined. What is clear is that both he and his wife were at one point being taken care of by Kevin Curry, who neighbors say had an acrimonious relationship with his parents. The younger man put his hands around his father\u2019s throat during a fight at the Whittier home, the newspaper reported. Another time, Kevin Curry told his father, \u201cI could kill you,\u201d and threatened to \u201cmess him up.\u201d The restraining order against Kevin Curry \u2014 who has served time in prison for assault with a deadly weapon, fraud and domestic assault \u2014 was granted two months after the fight, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cTheir relationship has always been kind of volatile, if you want to call it that,\u201d neighbor Zania Leon told the BBC. \u201cKevin, you could hear him at all different hours of the night just pounding on their door, trying to get in, screaming at them \u2014 profanities. We worried for their safety.\u201d Doctors did, too. \u201cA review of Roger Curry\u2019s medical records reveals that Mrs. Curry and Kevin Curry had been named in several reports of suspected neglect of Mr. Roger Curry,\u201d according to court documents filed by the Los Angeles County Office of the Public Guardian. The office is seeking conservatorship of Roger Curry, which would give the government control over his finances and care. In particular, the family\u2019s housing situation was unstable after a fire left their home in Whittier uninhabitable, said Connie Draxler, deputy director of the public guardian\u2019s office. \u201cWe have unconfirmed reports of them being in motels and drifting,\u201d she said. \u201cAt one point, they were actually living in the back yard of [their] burned-out home.\u201d Neighbors told the BBC that the elderly Currys slept on an air mattress in the back yard behind a padlocked gate. Kevin Curry and his mother, Mary Jo, did not return messages from The Washington Post seeking comment. Kevin Curry told the BBC that he had nothing to do with the abandonment of his father in England. Curry said his father became ill when they were on vacation in England and that he asked a friend to take him to the hospital. The court documents disputed that, using dry legal language to describe an act that shocked Britons. \u201cMr. Curry was taken surreptitiously to England by his wife, Mary Curry, and his son, Kevin Curry, and abandoned\u201d in the countryside, the request for conservatorship says. The court documents say one of the men who \u201cfound\u201d Roger Curry on that winter morning had been instructed to do so by the elderly man\u2019s son. That man, Simon Hayes, told investigators that \u201cKevin Curry and Mary Curry had brought Mr. Curry to \u2026 England so that he could be hospitalized there.\u201d While Roger Curry was in the hospital, Hayes told authorities, the elderly man\u2019s family continued on their European vacation. The modern-day equivalent, which is on the rise in Japan, according to the magazine, involves driving elderly family members to hospitals or the offices of nearby charities and \u201cessentially giving them up for adoption.\u201d In Roger Curry\u2019s case, what remains unclear is the motive. Court documents say he was receiving post-retirement benefits from three places: the Social Security Administration, the U.S. Air Force and a pension fund with Kaiser Permanente. But court documents don\u2019t say whether his family was after that money. But caring for Roger Curry, who needs 24-hour care, can be expensive \u2014 between $1,000 and $6,000 a month, or more, Draxler said. And that doesn\u2019t include the physical or emotional toll of caring for a senescent parent. \u201cThere\u2019s the potential that all the things could have been potential motive,\u201d Draxler said. \u201cWe have not engaged in that conversation with his family.\u201d Police also haven\u2019t described what they think the motive was. Officers in America haven\u2019t arrested his relatives. So far, Hayes is the only person to be charged, accused of lying to authorities. He\u2019s out on bail awaiting trial. Now Roger Curry is in a Los Angeles-area nursing home under the care of the L.A. County Public Guardian. The county is requesting permanent conservatorship. If a judge grants it, the government would take care of Roger Curry for the rest of his life. Court documents say no one in Roger Curry\u2019s family has objected to the government\u2019s request. \u201cNo one in his family is prepared to accept responsibility for him,\u201d the documents say. \u201cHis own wife and son abused him when they took him overseas only to abandon him there.\u201d", "Title: One doctor\u2019s old-fashioned idea to cut health care spending: house calls Content: RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 The two medical students in the back seat lurch left. Then right. Then left again. \u201cI\u2019m hoping you guys are not vertiginous or anything,\u201d calls out Peter Boling, 60, as his taupe Passat carves the winding, wooded road to his afternoon house call. Boling, an affable geriatrician who looks like George Bluth but drives like Jeff Gordon, has been visiting elderly patients in their homes since 1984. In those early years, as a newly-minted faculty member at Virginia Commonwealth University, he staffed a clinic in the morning and made house calls in the afternoon. Home visits **,** by then, already had become pass\u00e9. In the 1930s, doctors saw patients at home about 40 percent of the time. In the 1980s, nearly all visits took place at the physician\u2019s office or at a hospital. Less than 1 percent were house calls. Modern medicine was centralizing, trapping primary care physicians in their own webs of equipment and auxiliary staff. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Boling\u2019s experiences, though, convinced him that there is still a role for medicine in the home, particularly for the frailest of the elderly. These patients need more attention than a 15-minute clinic appointment affords them. For many, just getting to a clinic is a struggle. So a slight complaint is allowed to fester into a crisis, an ambulance and an expensive emergency room visit. \u201cThe idea is to deliver health care where it\u2019s best for the patient,\u201d Boling says. \u201cIf the clinic is the right place for them, then come to the clinic. If it\u2019s hard for them to come to the clinic, short-term or long-term, we\u2019ll go to them.\u201d Boling revs through a turn, sending up a puff of rust-red leaves. He tells the students how he got to this moment today. Decades ago, he and his colleagues at the American Academy of Home Care Medicine embarked on a saga to spread this very personal way of caring for sick elderly patients. Studies were done. The system saved money. Patients were healthier. Families were happier. Still, few wanted to pay for this rather old-fashioned model of health care. Medicare reimbursed at a paltry rate for house calls. Most of the house-call outfits ran at a loss, subsidized by grants or a sponsoring hospital. The doctors realized that if they wanted to change how medicine was practiced, they had to change how Americans paid for it. Their efforts came to a head with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which funded a three-year incentive program called Independence at Home. Like many of the other cost-saving experiments that the ACA set into motion, Independence at Home does not propose an entirely new way to deliver health care. It just demonstrates a new way to fund it. The 17 participating house-call practices are to get an annual bonus \u2014 dating to 2012 \u2014 based on how much money they saved Medicare by keeping their patients healthy and out of the hospital. The results of the first year are expected to come out shortly. Because these house-call teams serve some of Medicare\u2019s sickest \u2014 and most expensive \u2014 patients, the savings could be huge. In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office calculated that the top 5 percent of Medicare cases in a given year account for 43 percent of total costs. Overall, Medicare accounts for 14 percent of the national budget, or about $500 billion annually. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For the teams of doctors and nurses participating in the study, those savings would translate into thousands of additional dollars in revenue per patient each year \u2014 the kind of money that would allow the teams to hire more staff members and pay a competitive salary. Boling has another mission. The nation faces a dire shortage of family doctors, especially those who focus on the elderly. And no wonder: Primary care is exhausting. The hours are long and the pay is paltry compared with specialties such as dermatology or plastic surgery. \u201cOne of my goals, my career-long goals when I quit, is to have established an economic model that makes this a desirable mode of practice,\u201d Boling says. He understands that medical school debt is crushing. \u201cBut I think if I could pay these guys like a hospitalist, like a junior cardiologist or something, many of them would be flocking to our door.\u201d All of which explains why, today, Boling is driving two second-year med students to see 93-year-old Helen Shadoan. * * * Boling and his students pull into the parking lot at Heritage Oaks, a retirement complex 15 minutes from downtown. A tottering ragtime tune issues from the common room piano. The crowd shuffles inside Shadoan\u2019s spare living room. On a wooden table in the corner, a white Teddy bear leans against an empty flowerpot. An oxygen machine and its tubes are neatly arranged near the entrance. Shadoan, 93, sits in a pink gown facing the single window. A rotation of home-care aides looks after her round-the-clock. She is blind and hard of hearing, but her voice is still lustrous. She used to be an audiovisual technician, she says, developing photographs and making charts. \u201cDo you still remember where you used to work?\u201d someone asks. \u201cCertainly!\u201d she says. \u201cThe Veterans Administration \u2014 well, I guess it\u2019s Veterans Affairs now.\u201d Marie Gerardo, the nurse practitioner in charge of her case, begins to tell Boling about Shadoan\u2019s recent brush with pneumonia. Autumn is a perilous time for the elderly. A couple of weeks ago, Shadoan began to run a fever. \u201cHer temp in the evening was 101.5 and her pressure when I was here was in the 80s over 60s,\u201d Gerardo says. The room inhales all at once. \u201cSo I was begging her to go to the emergency room, literally.\u201d But Shadoan flatly refused. Boling leans over to talk into Shadoan\u2019s ear. \u201cWhen you had that pneumonia, you were really sick,\u201d he says. He grew up near Boston but he has worked nearly his entire career in Virginia. These days his voice slips into a slight twang when he talks to patients. \u201cDid you feel really sick?\u201d he asks. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t feel that bad,\u201d Shadoan says. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have that much energy.\u201d Boling tells the students that this common among older patients, who often can\u2019t tell how sick they actually are. \u201cI wanted her in the hospital,\u201d Gerardo continues. \u201cAnd Ms. Shadoan, at 93, was very emphatic about not going. She\u2019s blind and extremely hard of hearing, so a hospital visit is horrible for her.\u201d \u201cThey just give me a nervous breakdown,\u201d Shadoan says. That day, Gerardo had acquiesced. She ordered a mobile chest X-ray and started Shadoan on antibiotics. She did not force her patient to go to the emergency room. This, in the end, was the right call. Shadoan was more comfortable at home. She was spared an unnecessary hospitalization, and Medicare saved money. \u201cIt probably took her a bit longer to get better, but in reality she was probably better served not being in the hospital,\u201d Gerardo says. \u201cShe has done really quite well.\u201d Boling turns to the two student doctors standing near the wall. Shadoan is still recovering a bit from the pneumonia, and Boling wants the students to break out their stethoscopes. How does her chest sound? Do they think Gerardo made the right choice? * * * When President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, most of the nation focused on how the law would extend health-care coverage to more Americans. Recall the bitterly debated insurance mandates; the push to expand Medicaid that some governors foreswore as federal meddling. Although concerns about ballooning medical spending had gotten the ball rolling on health-care reform, the actual legislation did not roll out grand plans for containing health-care costs. Instead, the law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to oversee a salvo of demonstration projects, each promising to zap various inefficiencies in the system. A curious fact about health care in the United States is that most doctors can diagnose its dysfunctions in an instant. They know they should spend more time with their patients, and spend more time following up on them. They want to. They also know they should talk more with nurses, should talk more with social workers, should talk more with psychiatrists, should talk more with pharmacists, and so on. But by and large, the system can punish those instincts. Most doctors have little opportunity do the kind of coordination and follow-up that leads to better health outcomes. You cannot bill Medicare, for instance, for spending an extra hour on the phone trying to figure out why your patient didn\u2019t get her at-home oxygen tank. But that might be exactly the kind of miscellaneous assistance she needs to get better, and the kind of assistance she might never receive because no one has the time to notice the problem, let alone delegate it to a social worker, if there even is one on staff. \u201cThe system pays for the bricks, but it won\u2019t pay for the cement,\u201d says Bruce Kinosian, a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. One of the goals of the ACA is to figure out, in different ways, how to pay for that cement. Earlier this year, Kinosian co-wrote a study on the house-call programs operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs. He and his colleagues \u2014 including Thomas Edes, the VA\u2019s director of geriatrics \u2014 compared the medical costs of patients before and after they entered a house-call program. They found that the VA\u2019s house-call teams not only paid for themselves, but they also went on to reduce overall health-care costs by 12 percent. In part this was because patients were 25 percent less likely to go to a hospital. In the VA study, patients also reported sky-high satisfaction ratings: 83 percentsaid their care was \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d Another study this year, also in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, compared patients in a D.C. house-call program to a carefully matched control group with similar diseases and medical histories. The house-call patients cost Medicare 17 percent less. About half of the savings came from reduced hospitalizations, and another chunk from keeping patients out of nursing facilities. A theme of modern health-care reform has been a process called \u201caligning incentives.\u201d That means, for instance, fining hospitals that discharge patients who quickly land in the hospital again. It also means paying for results, not for individual procedures. Boling and his colleagues have lobbied hard for the government to recognize the savings and increased satisfaction that their house-call programs generate. Independence at Home, which is limited to 10,000 patients, is an attempt to show how house-call practices can get a cut of the savings they generate. The Medicare office uses a statistical model to predict how much each patient is expected to cost each year. If a house-call team can bring their patients\u2019 costs below the prediction, through better care or fewer emergency room visits, Medicare will share the savings with that team. Medicare takes the first 5 percent saved each year, and gives the doctors 80 percent of any savings thereafter. Under this formula, a house-call team might get a couple of thousand of dollars extra per patient per year if it can reduce a costs by 10 to 15 percent \u2014 a reduction that\u2019s in line with what the studies predict. The money would be a great boon to these practices, most of which can handle only 200 to 500 of these complex, sick patients. (A typical primary care physician might serve 2,500 regular patients.) In his practice, Boling could use the money to hire a couple of extra social workers or physicians. * * * Boling, who chairs the geriatrics division at VCU\u2019s medical school, runs two house-call teams at the university. He staffs each with a handful of physicians and nurse practitioners, along with social workers, triage nurses and, recently, a pharmacist. Once a week, the teams assemble to discuss their patients and various aspects of their lives. This is the kind of health care that Boling thinks millions of elderly Americans should have access to: comprehensive, in-depth and insistent. \u201cWe get into every little part of their medical history and their social history,\u201d says Susanna Payne, a nurse practitioner. \u201cI know how many grades she completed in school, I know what she used to do for work. I know how how many kids she has, how many are still alive. How many are actually involved in her care.\u201d The program is not for everyone. Boling\u2019s doctors focus on the most complex cases: people with multiple chronic illnesses, who rarely leave the house. These are the ones who benefit most from the careful services they provide. On a recent Thursday, with her colleagues gathered around a conference table, Payne runs down the information on one of her newer charges. Mary is an 82-year-old with high blood pressure, a pacemaker and impaired vision from macular degeneration, with a history of vertigo and stroke. She recently went to the emergency room because she felt dizzy and her urine was dark. The doctors there diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection and sent her home. (Mary\u2019s last name has been withheld for privacy reasons.) These are the kinds of unnecessary ER visits that the team tries to prevent. Someone could have helped her over the phone, or with a quick visit. The team always has someone on call 24/7. For five years, Payne says, Mary has been relying on the emergency room for her primary care. \u201cShe\u2019s used to calling 911 and going to these hospitals when she really needs something,\u201d Payne tells the group. It takes \u201ca little while for people to get used to having access to care, to learn to rely on us,\u201d Boling says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t usually take too terribly long for people to find that they don\u2019t like the ER experience as much as having someone come to their house.\u201d On a recent house call, Mary complained of painful calluses on her feet. Payne arranged a visit from a podiatrist. Mary also showed Payne a $200 bill for a medical bracelet that she could not afford. Payne immediately e-mailed the team\u2019s social worker to see if she could get the bracelet for free. \u201cWhen you go into someone\u2019s house, you stumble across these things that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily stumble across in clinic, that really do cause a great deal of anxiety,\u201d Payne says. Treating very frail elderly patients often requires treating families. Physician Amy Paul brings up another patient she\u2019s worried about, a bedbound 87-year-old woman who lives with her daughter and grandchildren. The daughter, who looks after her mother, is supposed to be seeing a psychiatrist, but she hasn\u2019t been going. The daughter\u2019s blood-sugar levels also recently were so high that she needed a shot of insulin from the ER. But during her home visit, Paul saw the daughter having sweet tea with crackers and Doritos \u2014 terrible foods for someone with high blood sugar. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a couple of visits with a lot of education,\u201d Paul says. * * * In Helen Shadoan\u2019s apartment, kneeling in the afternoon light, Sarah Hughes lifts her stethoscope to the elderly woman\u2019s chest. All med students at VCU are required to sign up for a house call. Hughes wants to become a pediatrician. She\u2019s used to being in clinics, where she says the pace is much quicker \u2014 20 minutes per patient, tops. By now, they\u2019ve already been in Shadoan\u2019s room for 35. Gerardo instructs her to lean closer and talk in a deeper voice so that Shadoan can hear her. \u201cHi, Ms. Shadoan,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI\u2019m a student. My name is Sarah. Can I listen to your heart?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d Shadoan says. \u201cJust tell me what you want me to do.\u201d \u201cYou just sit there. You\u2019re doing great,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cYou guys have been remembering to observe when you walked in, right?\u201d Boling says, as the students wrap up. \u201cYou noticed the oxygen tubing and the walker. Now, Ms. Shadoan can\u2019t see, so she\u2019s already adapted her environment to some extent. She knows where everything is in this apartment, exactly.\u201d The conversation turns to her daily routine. She wakes up at 5 or 6 every morning and switches on MSNBC. She likes political talk shows, \u201cMorning Joe\u201d in particular. She voted for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in the 2008 presidential race, and Obama in 2012. \u201cWell as far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s okay,\u201d Shadoan says of the president. \u201cHe\u2019s not the best one we ever had. He\u2019s certainly isn\u2019t the worst.\u201d The best one? \u201cOh my, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe FDR. He\u2019s the first one I ever voted for.\u201d Someone asks for her thoughts on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t quite understand it,\u201d she says, pausing. \u201cMy son\u2019s thoroughly against it.

While the home care industry has the fastest growing number of jobs in America, these workers are some of the lowest paid in the country \u2013 earning, on average, $13,000 a year. To get enough hours to pay the bills, Hughes works from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. But she and her daughter still rely on public assistance to make ends meet. UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Education, which I chair, has analyzed state spending for Medicaid/Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and federal spending for those programs as well as food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit. We found that, on average, 52 percent of state public assistance spending supports working families (defined as working for at least 26 weeks a year and 10 hours a week) \u2013 with costs as high as $3.7 billion in California, $3.3 billion in New York, and $2 billion in Texas. In recent months, the substantial public cost of low wages has prompted elected officials to take action. Legislators in California, Colorado, Maine, Oregon, and Washington are considering increasing the minimum wage to $12 an hour. In Connecticut, a proposal currently moving through the state legislature would fine large companies that pay low wages in an effort to recoup the costs imposed on taxpayers. When 73 percent of people who benefit from major public assistance programs live in a working family, our economy isn\u2019t operating the way it should \u2013 and could \u2013 be. From 2003-2013, inflation-adjusted wages fell for the entire bottom 70 percent of the workforce.

Will \u2018fixing\u2019 it work for players? Content: There isn\u2019t an issue in sports that activates paternalism, patronizing ideas and outright self-righteousness quite like the NBA age limit. Everyone has an opinion about what\u2019s wrong. Everyone claims to want to protect the game and the players. Few will admit that most of the suggested solutions are flawed and fundamentally unfair to the very people they want to help. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who is the most earnest and thoughtful of his kind, has restarted the debate during the Finals, saying repeatedly that the 19-year-old age limit is failing both the league and college basketball. He wants reform. He has long preferred raising the age minimum to 20, but he admits, \u201cI\u2019m re-thinking our position.\u201d In other words, submit your best proposals in a timely manner. He\u2019s willing to listen, at least for a little while. But he\u2019s itching to act. \u201cMy sense is, it\u2019s not working for anyone,\u201d Silver said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not working certainly from the college coaches and athletics directors I hear from. They\u2019re not happy with the current system. And I know our teams aren\u2019t happy, either, in part because they don\u2019t necessarily think that the players that are coming into the league are getting the kind of training that they would expect to see among top draft picks in the league. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to come together with everyone who is interested in the community, whether it be the colleges, our union, agents, lots of points of view out there, and see if we can come up with a better system.\u201d What\u2019s the answer? I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure there is a system that would satisfy all factions. And while a more symbiotic relationship between the NBA and college basketball would be beneficial, Silver is married to the best interests of the NBA, and he must reach an agreement with the players\u2019 association to implement a new policy. That alone indicates the possibility for a cure-all is minimal. But here\u2019s one thought about an overall approach: Consider, for once, what\u2019s fair for the athletes, who become adults, at least legally, at age 18. Not just what seems right in utopia. What\u2019s fair. Don\u2019t let hypocrisy and the need to control get in the way of finding a system that is fair to them, even if fairness must include the freedom to make dumb decisions. I didn\u2019t like it when former commissioner David Stern raised the age minimum to 19 in 2005. He wanted 20, but in collective bargaining, he had to settle for 19. It is now considered the one-and-done rule because, for the past 11 years, elite players have signed short leases in college and bolted after a single season. No matter the rule, the best players are going to leave for the NBA as soon as they are eligible, and it\u2019s disingenuous when anyone acts surprised that this happens. As a basketball junkie who enjoys every level of the sport, I have enjoyed having my curiosity satisfied by watching the likes of Kevin Durant, John Wall and Anthony Davis play college basketball. When college coaches and athletic directors claim that one-and-done has been awful for them, they\u2019re misleading. The star power has benefitted the game. It also has created some interesting recruiting parity because traditional powers chase the top talent, ignoring long-term roster issues for short-term thrills, and it provides more opportunities for less glamorous programs to reap the benefits of building with second-, third- and fourth-tier recruits who will stay in school and acquire the maturity to compete against raw freshmen obsessed with draft prospects. It\u2019s no coincidence that George Mason, Butler, Gonzaga, VCU and Wichita State have all gone to the Final Four during this one-and-done era. The clashes of philosophies \u2014 the Kentucky Way versus the Wichita State Way, for instance \u2014 have made the sport more compelling. But I didn\u2019t like the NBA raising the age minimum because the league used paternalistic tendencies to set a policy that hinders a young star\u2019s ability to make money. It\u2019s money that NBA teams, despite their whining, were happy to give these kids straight out of high school. When Kevin Garnett made the leap from high school in 1995, he started the NBA\u2019s 11-year preps-to-pros era. It was awkward. It produced some busts, which are often used to obstruct the many success stories. But ultimately, NBA teams couldn\u2019t resist drafting for potential. They didn\u2019t want to miss out on the next Tracy McGrady. Their actions told kids to go pro early, and of course, more did. Then, in 2005, the NBA tried to save teams from themselves. Now, teams don\u2019t want the burden of developing 19-year-olds. It\u2019s funny because there\u2019s a decent chance that all 14 of the lottery picks in the 2017 draft could be college freshmen or international players of the same age. Without question, the entire top five will be one-and-done players, which will mark the first time that has happened since the rule change. In this one-and-done era, there have been 11 drafts so far, which means 55 top-five picks. Twenty-nine of those selections have been college freshmen. Seven of them have gone on to be all-stars, and five more can be considered budding stars. And that doesn\u2019t include Mike Conley Jr., one of the league\u2019s best point guards, who signed a record $153 million contract last summer. It doesn\u2019t include Derrick Favors, Enes Kanter, Tristan Thompson and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who all have big contracts and significant value to their teams. Of those 29 top-five, one-and-done selections, just three have been three complete busts: Tyrus Thomas, Greg Oden (because of injuries) and Anthony Bennett. Of the 15 players who made the all-NBA team this season, five left college after their freshman season. And then there is LeBron James, a former preps- to-pros phenom. Include Rudy Gobert and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and more than half of the all-NBA roster entered the league before turning 20. One-and-done players aren\u2019t destroying the game, and at the highest level, they aren\u2019t flopping like crazy. The same was true for high schoolers. The problem is the NBA\u2019s tolerance level. The teams want it both ways. They want to draft for potential because they know their competitors will do the same, and then they gripe that potential requires time. They have the freedom to choose the more difficult path, but the teams want to restrict the players\u2019 rights to do so because it\u2019s more convenient for them. Well, that\u2019s part of being a league, I suppose. You get to set standards. But don\u2019t pretend these policies are about what\u2019s best for the players or even the game. As much as the NBA complains, as much as college basketball complains, they have options. Meantime, the players are left without a voice. They are left to navigate the whims and interests of self-righteous entities, skeptical about which sides really care about them, knowing that, whatever decision is made, their right to earn will buried beneath a bunch of sanctimonious blather. Because we all know what\u2019s best for them.

It\u2019s quite likely that David Price\u2019s services will still be available when baseball\u2019s decision-makers convene in Nashville, less than an hour\u2019s drive from his hometown of Murfreesboro, Tenn. But before they arrive at the meetings, executives already began swapping players \u2013 a process that is often more interesting and more fruitful than signing free agents. Closer Craig Kimbrel went from San Diego to Boston. Shortstop Andrelton Simmons went from Atlanta to the Angels. And there should be more to come. Here are five of the best candidates to be traded before spring training. **Starlin Castro** , shortstop, Cubs *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico After the first five years of his career produced a .284 average/.325 on-base percentage/.410 slugging percentage and three all-star appearances, Castro seemed established in Chicago. But last summer, the Cubs traded for shortstop prospect Addison Russell \u2013 and he eventually bumped Castro from the spot in 2015. Castro moved to second, but the Cubs also have Javier Baez on the way from the minors. And Castro\u2019s production fell to .265/.296/.375 in 2015. The Cubs could be selling low on Castro, but they have enough needs \u2013 starting pitching, a center fielder, a left-handed bat \u2013 to be motivated to move. Castro\u2019s contract would be easy to absorb, too \u2013 he\u2019s owed $40.4 million for the next four seasons with a $16-million salary for 2020 that can be bought out for $1 million \u2013 though he\u2019ll be just 30 by then. **Teams that could use him:** Mets, White Sox, Padres *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Aroldis Chapman** , closer, Reds *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Of the three premier closers available at last year\u2019s trade deadline, two have been dealt \u2013 Jonathan Papelbon from Philadelphia to Washington last July, Kimbrel from San Diego to Boston this month. Chapman, though, remains. In his four full seasons as Cincinnati\u2019s closer, he has saved 145 of 160 chances with a 1.90 ERA, 0.958 walks and hits per inning pitched, and a staggering 456 strikeouts in 255-2/3 innings pitched \u2013 an average of 16.1 per nine innings. The tricky part: Chapman\u2019s contract situation. Because he\u2019s entering his final year of arbitration eligibility, he\u2019ll get a raise on his 2015 salary of $8.05 million \u2013 and then be free to walk after the year. No non-contender would trade for a closer to begin with, but Chapman\u2019s impending free agency means he has to go to a club that intends to win in 2016. **Teams that could use him:** Nationals, Astros, Mariners, Rangers *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Brett Gardner** , outfielder, Yankees *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico He\u2019s the first homegrown Yankees position player since Robinson Cano became an all-star in 2015, but his skillset is too similar to that of New York veteran Jacoby Ellsbury \u2013 left-handed, without a ton of pop. When the Yankees faced Houston lefty Dallas Keuchel in the AL wild card game, Manager Joe Girardi said he couldn\u2019t play both Gardner and Ellsbury, so he benched Ellsbury \u2013 in just the second year of a seven-year, $153-million deal. Gardner slumped tremendously after the all-star break, hitting .206 with a .592 OPS. But what\u2019s different from Ellsbury: Gardner\u2019s contract. He\u2019s due $37.5 million from 2016-18, and has either a $2-million buyout or $12.5-million salary in 2019. A team needing a versatile, left-handed-hitting outfielder could potentially get him for major-league-ready starting pitching. **Teams that could use him:** Nationals, Cubs *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Marcell Ozuna** , center fielder, Marlins *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Ozuna\u2019s estrangement in Miami began on July 6, when a 1-for-36 stretch that featured just one walk and 14 strikeouts dropped his average to .249, his OPS to .638 \u2013 and led to his demotion to the minors. He returned in mid-August and was better the rest of the way (.278 average, .789 OPS), but the Marlins are a team in transition. Last season began with hopes of contending and devolved into the firing of Manager Mike Redmond, the insertion of General Manager Dan Jennings into the dugout, and now the hiring of Don Mattingly as manager. Do the Marlins \u2014 with a core of Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich and Jose Fernandez \u2013 see themselves as contenders with the Mets and Nationals in the National League East in 2016? They could. **Teams that could use him:** Mets, Cubs *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Yasiel Puig** , outfielder, Dodgers *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Puig\u2019s first two seasons after being signed from Cuba showed off his flair and his potential \u2013 a .305 average, .386 on-base percentage and .502 slugging percentage with 35 homers in 252 games from 2013-14. But last fall, with the Dodgers\u2019 season on the line against the Mets in the division series, Puig started just once in five games and struck out in three of his six at-bats, failing to get a hit. He is expendable in Los Angeles because the Dodgers have veterans Andre Ethier and Carl Crawford to play the corner outfield spots. He is attractive to other teams not only because of his obvious talent, but because his contract seems reasonable \u2014 $24.6 million over the next three years. **Teams that could use him:** Mets, Indians *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: How did Marist, Monmouth, Suffolk and Quinnipiac get known for political polling? Content: HAMDEN, Conn. \u2014 Americans addicted to political polls can get their fix these days from a growing number of colleges and universities that measure the ups and downs of presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in a tumultuous election year. But the leaders in this expansion of academic polling are hardly household names outside of politics, including Marist College in New York, Monmouth University in New Jersey, Suffolk University in Massachusetts and Quinnipiac University here in Connecticut. For these schools, polling in a polarized America yields a marketing bonanza akin to what others might reap through college football bowl games or the NCAA basketball tournament. They are building brands through surveys of political battlegrounds. Monmouth, a private university with 6,400 students on the Jersey Shore, was little known beyond its state until recently. In 2007-2008, it conducted eight election polls, all in New Jersey. During this cycle, it has conducted more than 60, moving into swing states as far away as Colorado and Nevada. \u201cI am looking for visibility for my faculty, my staff and my university,\u201d Monmouth President Paul R. Brown said. \u201cI will take visibility many different ways \u2014 and this is one.\u201d During the past quarter-century, Quinnipiac has leveraged political polling as aggressively as any school in the country to raise its national profile. It has morphed from a sleepy private college, with fewer than 3,000 students in the mid-1980s, to a university with medical, law and engineering schools that expects to enroll nearly 10,000 this fall. Quinnipiac also has drawn attention for its strong ice hockey team in a region where the sport is popular. The Bobcats reached the NCAA championship game twice in the past four years, losing to nearby Yale in 2013 and North Dakota this year. But it is polling that has turbocharged the school\u2019s marketing. Just before the party conventions in July, Quinnipiac released surveys showing tight Clinton-Trump matchups in the swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. That generated priceless and immediate publicity. \u201cYou do a statewide poll in Florida, it\u2019s in 200 newspapers,\u201d said Quinnipiac President John L. Lahey. \u201cIt\u2019s on every local station all over Florida.\u201d Lahey is mindful that there are not just 29 electoral votes in the Sunshine State. There are also hundreds of thousands of high school students. The university recruits where it surveys, tying the work into a much broader strategy right from the start, Lahey said. His goal is to transform Quinnipiac \u201cinto a major national university.\u201d On a recent summer evening, the Quinnipiac call center crackled with the din of voices reading the latest scripted questions aimed at taking the temperature of the riled-up American electorate. There are 153 stations inside the center, and the university plans to add another 47 for the fall campaign. Callers are paid a starting rate of $10.50 an hour. Some are retirees looking for extra income, like 85-year-old Virginia King at Terminal 113. Some are students, like 21-year-old Alana Perrotta, who laughed as she wrapped up an interview at Terminal 80. \u201cThat was a really funny one,\u201d she said. Perrotta, from New Jersey, is a senior majoring in English and broadcast journalism. She had been quizzing a jaded young voter from the Bronx on a local contest coming up in New York. Over and over, she read him the names of the candidates. Each time, he said no. Which is not a usable answer for a scientific poll. Eventually, Perrotta\u2019s patience paid off and the voter voiced his preference. \u201cI had to get him to say the name,\u201d she said. Just as important for Quinnipiac, Perrotta opened the interview by saying her school\u2019s own mouthful of a name. KWIN-uh-pe-ack, the phonetic rendition of the pronunciation, is also spelled out in every one of the school\u2019s polling news releases. Political polling, which emerged in the 20th century through the influence of such pioneers as Elmo Roper, Louis Harris and George Gallup, has proliferated in recent years as political parties, consultants, candidates and the public have demanded ever more data, in real time, about the nation\u2019s voters. Colleges have joined a vast field of specialists \u2014 some polling for profit, some not \u2014 and media outlets that research public opinion. At the same time, debate has risen about the accuracy of polls in an era of rapid changes in demographics and communications technology. So how do the college pollsters compare to their peers outside academia? The website FiveThirtyEight, which analyzed the accuracy and methodology of polls going back several elections, rated Monmouth\u2019s an A-plus as of July 15, Marist\u2019s an A, Quinnipiac\u2019s an A-minus and Suffolk\u2019s a B-plus. The George Washington University Battleground poll received a B. Those were at least on par with marks given to many of the non-academic names in the field. Mason-Dixon Polling & Research got a B-plus and Gallup a B-minus. Several major news organizations were given A\u2019s or A-minuses. (Washington Post-ABC News polls were graded A-plus.) Many schools specialize in home-state polls. Muhlenberg and Franklin & Marshall colleges are known for Pennsylvania polling. Christopher Newport University and Roanoke College survey regularly in Virginia, which has emerged as a battleground in the past decade. Often, college polls are led by a professor with expertise in their state and public policy. Christopher Borick, who teaches political science at Muhlenberg, has been polling since 2001 for the private college in Allentown, Pa., which has 2,400 students. His surveys often study energy and the environment. But he also knows how to call a political horse race. \u201cWhen I put out a poll, I do a lot of the contextual analysis,\u201d Borick said. \u201cI know Pennsylvania politics. Part of what a college can do is to add, with us academics, the analysis, the background, the context, the history.\u201d Borick said he frequently gets calls from peers at other colleges who want to know how to start a poll. \u201cOften, they are smaller places without gigantic name recognition,\u201d he said. Their goal, in many cases, is \u201cHey, how can we use this to build a name brand?\u201d Many schools keep their polling budgets under wraps. One pollster said his school spends about $130,000 a year for a modest number of home-state polls. Other annual budgets are believed to range from several hundred thousand dollars a year to well over $1 million. Quinnipiac won\u2019t say what it spends on its large polling operation. But for perspective, it spends $125 million a year on academic instruction. Some colleges team with news media to share costs and analytical expertise. In June, the University of Southern California launched a daily national election poll with the Los Angeles Times. Suffolk partners with USA Today on national polls. Marist works with McClatchy News Service on national surveys as well as with NBC News and the Wall Street Journal on select battleground state polls. These partnerships deliver a bonus for the 6,400-student school in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., said Marist pollster Lee Miringoff: prominent, repeated coverage from the television network, the news service and the national newspaper. But with publicity comes risk for institutions that prize their reputation for independence and authority. \u201cYou\u2019re only as good as your last poll,\u201d Miringoff said. \u201cI worry about it for a lot of reasons: the reputation of the poll, the name of the college, our media partners. . . . We don\u2019t want to be part of the \u2018polls are wrong\u2019 story.\u201d FiveThirtyEight\u2019s analysis of 146 Marist polls found that 88 percent called races correctly. Of 169 Quinnipiac polls, the analysis found, 87 percent called races correctly. Quinnipiac pollster Doug Schwartz still winces at his first big miss \u2014 in 1994, the year he started here, when surveys were still done with paper and pencil in a room with 12 phones. His final poll in the New York gubernatorial race that fall showed Democrat Mario Cuomo cruising toward reelection 10 days before the vote. But Republican George Pataki surged to a solid victory in a big year for the GOP. \u201cThe lesson I learned was don\u2019t stop polling so far out,\u201d Schwartz said. But in 1998, he was on the money with a poll that showed Democrat Charles Schumer unseating Sen. Alfonse D\u2019Amato (R-N.Y.) by a comfortable margin. And in 2012, his polling predicted President Obama\u2019s triumphs over Republican Mitt Romney in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. Margins of error bedevil pollsters in swing states like those, especially when the winner finishes only a percentage point or two ahead. \u201cNailing an election exactly dead on is luck,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cBut we should get as close as we possibly can to the margin.\u201d For Quinnipiac, the growth of the polling shop since 1988 has coincided with the growth of the school as a whole. In that time, the college became a university, added two campuses, built a sports arena with sweeping hilltop views of Long Island Sound, opened a host of online and graduate programs, and grew its endowment to $368 million. Its medical school\u2019s first class will graduate next year. It draws 23,000 undergraduate applicants a year and admits about 65 percent \u2014 a measure of demand and selectivity unknown a few decades ago. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how it has grown even in the past five years,\u201d said Jenna Mojkowski, 22, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree here in 2014 and is working toward a doctorate in physical therapy. She said she is struck by how often the university is mentioned on cable television because of its polling. \u201cYou see it on the news. People now know what Quinnipiac is.\u201d Scott Clement contributed to this report.", "Title: Virginia Tech basketball preview: Quirky Coach Buzz Williams takes on rebuild Content: BLACKSBURG, Va. \u2014 For once, a response didn\u2019t immediately come to Virginia Tech men\u2019s basketball Coach Buzz Williams. He walked back to his office and, trying to jog his memory, began to leaf through a calendar that goes back a decade \u2014 each year separated by color, each line filled with short abbreviations only Williams can decipher. He grabbed one of the binders lined up behind his desk, monthly compendiums of every game and practice he has coached. He looked over to the unpacked boxes of diaries, filled with thoughts on everything from books he read to sermons he enjoyed to his storybook journey from tiny Van Alstyne, Tex., to junior college manager to coveted coaching commodity. Williams then moved to the bookcase, losing focus over the pages of one book titled \u201cUnclutter Your Soul.\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember buying it. Then he raised his head. What was the question again? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to see all the stuff I have. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s thousands and thousands of pages.\u201d If Buzz Williams saves Virginia Tech basketball, it will happen one quirk at a time. \u201cHe\u2019s a strange guy. I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d admitted his wife, Corey. Williams, 42, will officially begin the reclamation project few expected him to take when Virginia Tech opens its regular season schedule Friday against Maryland-Eastern Shore. In a stunning move, he left Marquette in March after three runs to the NCAA round of 16 in four years for a program picked to finish in last place in the ACC for the fourth consecutive year. A quick turnaround is unlikely with an undersize roster lean on experience. But if he needs any reminder of how he\u2019ll do it, Williams only has to look back in those meticulous notes, full of tasks only he could concoct. Every day, he resolves to read three chapters from three books. He must write, call, text or e-mail four people because he has an evolving list of 120 people he wants to be in touch with at least once a month. He must watch at least an hour of film daily. He allows himself one hour to check his e-mail. Did he work out? Did he eat right? Did he go to church? On Tuesdays and Thursdays, there\u2019s time carved out to contact three parents of Virginia Tech players or recruits. Practices are scheduled at seemingly random times, like 7:32 a.m. or 6:17 p.m., and being on time means showing up six minutes early. Whenever he meets someone interesting, influential or impactful, he takes a picture \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a picture freak,\u201d he said \u2014 and has it made into a magnet to put on his office wall. Every day, meanwhile, is summed up by a picture taken on his ever-present cellphone. Last week, he gave his team a lecture about the NBA Development League. Last month, he taught the players the proper way to stand when \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d is played before games. On this afternoon, there is a meeting about his charitable foundation for special needs children, Buzz\u2019s Bunch. This week, he\u2019ll hold tryouts for the basketball team his two sons play on. Wait, what? He\u2019s coaching two teams this winter and always has? \u201cIt is a comedy show when he coaches because he coaches with about the same intensity as he does at Virginia Tech and these little kids are a little scared,\u201d Corey Williams said, noting her husband would have to miss only two youth league games this year because of his duties with the Hokies. \u201cI always have to warn the other parents that he really is friendly and not crazy. I hold my breath most of the time when he coaches.\u201d His track record on the court, though, is nearly impeccable \u2014 a career record of 153-86 and five NCAA tournament appearances in seven seasons (one at New Orleans and six at Marquette). Which begged the question this offseason: Why come to Virginia Tech, which is coming off a 9-22 season, its worst since 1955, and take a slight pay cut to do it? Williams\u2019s answer is he wanted to build something from the ground up and liked Whit Babcock, the Hokies\u2019 new athletic director. He doesn\u2019t acknowledge rumors of tension with Marquette\u2019s administration or that he worried about the new Big East\u2019s long-term viability. But even Williams concedes last year \u201cwas hard on me.\u201d Marquette finished 17-15 and missed the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2005. His first months in Blacksburg weren\u2019t easy, either. Five players left the program for varying reasons, a development that caught Williams by surprise. But he buttressed the roster with four freshmen and three transfers, including former Maryland guard Seth Allen, who won\u2019t be eligible until next season. He has another talented recruiting class on the way next year. Before that, though, Williams thinks he finally found what he had been scouring for on his bookshelf. His latest obsession is the brain and how people learn. He cops to devouring any book about Philadelphia Eagles Coach Chip Kelly. He already pre-ordered books on Bill Parcells and Jim Boeheim. He recommended \u201cMind Gym\u201d by Gary Mack to all of his players. A few people have even approached about writing a book on him and all of his eccentricities. He\u2019s not sure whether it\u2019s a good idea. \u201cTwo years from now, three years from now, it\u2019s just assumed, unspoken, that Buzz is weird,\u201d he said. And alas, an answer soon escaped him again, his mind suddenly onto the next part of this rebuild. **More NCAA basketball previews:** Hokies story lines for the season | Schedule **Virginia:** Brogdon at head of the class | Story lines | Schedule **Georgetown:** Joshua Smith is back on campus | Story lines Video: Coach John Thompson III on the Hoyas | Schedule **George Washington:** High hopes with healthy back court | Story lines Video: Coach Mike Lonergan on the Colonials | Schedule **Maryland women:** Facing life without Thomas | Story lines | Schedule **Women\u2019s capsule previews:** Surveying the D.C. area **Men\u2019s capsule previews:** American | GMU | Howard | Navy **National previews:** ACC boasts a Mount Rushmore of coaches Top players to watch this season | Burning questions **John Feinstein:** At Kentucky, sophomores are the new freshmen National scores and schedule | Preseason top 25 rankings **College blog coverage:** Terrapins Insider | Early Lead | Fancy Stats | D.C.

On Wednesday, advocates for stricter requirements stood beside 7-year-old leukemia survivor Rhett Krawitt as he delivered a petition bearing 30,000 signatures to the governor. Earlier this year, Krawitt gave a rousing speech at a local school board meeting in which the first grader said \u201cI give a damn\u201d about mandatory vaccinations.

The CDC says that until that point, every year 3 to 4 million people were infected, 48,000 of them went to the hospital and 400 to 500 people died. After the elimination declaration in 2000, between 37 and 220 people reported having measles each year in the United States \u2014 until last year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The number of measles cases in the country skyrocketed, nearly tripling the highest number seen in the preceding 13 years. As noted above, there were no more than 220 cases in a given year between 2001 and 2013. In 2014, there were 644 cases stemming from nearly two dozen outbreaks.

The majority of people who get measles have not been vaccinated. In California, for example, half of the people with measles in the current outbreak have not been vaccinated (and vaccination status is still not known for many of the others). Still, even if people aren\u2019t getting vaccinated, they aren\u2019t spontaneously developing measles. The disease has to come from somewhere.

(The CDC estimates that each year, about 20 million people around the world get measles and that 122,000 people die from it.) \u201cThe only way it can come is from other countries, usually from U.S. travelers who travel abroad and who are not protected through vaccinations, who get infected overseas and bring it back,\u201d Jane Seward, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s viral disease division, told me during one of the outbreaks last year. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association \u2014 Pediatrics last year found that 88 percent of measles cases in the country \u201cwere internationally imported or epidemiologically or virologically linked to importation.\u201d There were a few cases not linked to any kind of importation over a period from 2001 to 2011, but they did not seem to be endemic, researchers said.

The vaccination status of 34 of these people is known, the health department said, and all but six of those people had not been vaccinated. One other person had received one of the two recommended doses. The situation in the state points to a specific danger presented by an infectious disease that can be spread by people who have traveled overseas and those who have not been vaccinated. Travelers from overseas who do not live in the United States or visit it frequently will often go to tourist attractions such as theme parks, which draw very large crowds. If those crowds contain people who have not been vaccinated, they can potentially contract a disease and bring it back to a community full of other people who may be susceptible. For public health officials in the state, they are monitoring possible measles cases and expecting additional cases to emerge in the near future.

Dozens of people have fallen ill with the disease, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated. The year 2014 was already a banner year for measles in the U.S., with preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing the highest number of cases in over two decades. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico My colleague Jason Millman reported last week on the results of a study showing that vaccine skeptics tend to cluster together in like-minded, often wealthy communities. Since the study focused on just a handful of northern California counties, I'd like to extend that analysis by looking at vaccine refusal across the entire state of California **** \\-- as a result both of vaccine denial and religious objections. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The map below is a first crack at that. Using data from the California Department of Public Health, it divides the state into equal-area grids, and within each area it counts the number of public school kindergartners with what's known as a \"personal belief exemption\" (PBE) to state vaccine requirements. The hexagon markers are sized by the total number of kindergartners in the area, and colored according to the percent of them with PBEs. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It's important to note a couple things. First, the actual number of kindergartners entering school without their full slate of vaccines is considerably higher than this map suggests. This map only represents kids whose parents have taken a stance against vaccines by applying for a PBE. Statewide about 2.5 percent of kindergartners fall into this category. Overall nearly 10 percent of California kindergartners don't start school fully vaccinated. Most of these kids are \"conditional entrants,\" who, for whatever reasons, are behind in their vaccines but plan to get them. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It's also worth noting that the map only shows public school kids, as geographic data for private schools wasn't available. Kindergartners in private school are more than twice as likely (5.3 percent) to have a PBE than public school kids (2.5 percent). Still, the map provides a useful barometer of the level of principled opposition to vaccines in the state, and that's how I'll be discussing it. Orange County, home to Disneyland, stands out as a cluster of dark red, as do parts of coastal San Diego county. The wealthy southern California coast from Malibu up to San Luis Obispo also stands out. Farther north, Santa Cruz, Marin and Sonoma counties are dark red. Inland there's a belt of anti-vaccine intensity from about Fresno, up through Sacramento and into Yuba county. Pockets of high PBE rates dot most of the northern California landscape. On the other hand, the Los Angeles area is generally vaccine-friendly, as are much of the San Francisco and Silicon Valley regions. The relatively low-income areas in the central valley also have low rates of vaccine opposition. Since California provides district-level vaccination data going back to 2000, it's also possible to map the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment over time. Check out the three maps below. Back in 2000, only 0.77 percent of California kindergartners had personal belief exemptions from vaccines. By 2013, that percentage had more than quadrupled to 3.15 percent. The scale on these maps tops off at 5 percent. But in some individual school districts, the actual PBE rate is much, much higher. At River Springs Charter School in Temecula, California, nearly a quarter of the 556 kindergartners had personal belief exemptions this year. A third of the kindergartners at the Visions in Education public school in Carmichael hold PBEs, as do 51 percent of kindergartners at Ocean Grove Charter School in Boulder Creek. At a handful of private schools, the PBE rate is 75 percent or more. It goes without saying that a measles outbreak in these communities could be devastating. These parents are gambling with the lives not only of their children, but of other kids in their communities as well -- especially of young children and toddlers who aren't old enough to get all their vaccines yet. According to USA Today, six of the Disneyland measles cases were among infants too young to be vaccinated. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We need what's known as \"herd immunity\" to keep these most vulnerable populations safe from infectious diseases. For measles, that immunity kicks in with vaccination rates somewhere between 83 and 94 percent, according to the CDC. So even letting five percent of the kids in your community skip the vaccine is inviting trouble. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Fortunately, the news out of California isn't all bad. Starting with the current school year, California parents are required to consult a health care professional before being certified for a PBE. That's resulted in a drop in the PBE rate from 3.2 percent last year to 2.5 percent this year -- a welcome trend. The Disneyland outbreak also seems to be giving the issue enough visibility that some Californians previously on the fence are willing to change their minds. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico I'm also singling out California simply because it does such a great job of making these numbers publicly available -- as far as the states go, it's far from the bottom of the pack on vaccination rates. According to numbers compiled by the Bloomberg Data team, California is ranked 39th in the nation on overall vaccination rates, with 65.3 percent of its children receiving all seven CDC-recommended shots. By contrast the bottom-ranked state, Alaska, only has a 59.1 percent vaccination rate, while the top, Mississippi, has a rate of 76 percent. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico With any luck, in the aftermath of the California measles outbreak we'll see these number climb.", "Title: Obama to parents doubting \u2018indisputable\u2019 science: \u2018Get your kids vaccinated\u2019 Content: In the face of a growing measles outbreak, President Obama is urging parents to heed modern science and vaccinate their children. \u201cThere is every reason to get vaccinated \u2014 there aren\u2019t reasons to not,\u201d Obama said in an interview with NBC News.

The challenge centers on new rules attached to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, which provides money to local governments to buy police vehicles and other equipment. The new rules include a requirement that localities give federal immigration authorities open access to jails and notify them 48 hours in advance of plans to release an inmate wanted on an immigration detainer. Filed in Northern Illinois District Court, the lawsuit argues that the requirements \u201cfederalize\u201d local jails and violate the constitutional rights of inmates. \u201cChicago will not be blackmailed into changing our values, and we are and will remain a welcoming City,\u201d Emanuel said in a statement late Sunday. \u201cThe federal government should be working with cities to provide necessary resources to improve public safety, not concocting new schemes to reduce our crime fighting resources.\u201d The Justice Department responded sharply Monday, accusing Chicago leaders of putting illegal immigrants above the safety of police and citizens. \u201cIn 2016, more Chicagoans were murdered than in New York City and Los Angeles combined,\u201d Justice Department spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley said in an email. \u201cSo it\u2019s especially tragic that the mayor is less concerned with that staggering figure than he is spending time and taxpayer money protecting criminal aliens and putting Chicago\u2019s law enforcement at greater risk.\u201d The lawsuit comes as President Trump is trying to make good on his promise to crack down on unlawful immigration by building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and more aggressively enforcing federal immigration laws. Among his priorities on this front is cracking down on \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d which in the administration\u2019s view undermine efforts to root out and deport violent criminals who are in the country illegally. The cities, meanwhile, say they are not required to closely cooperate with federal immigration authorities and that doing so makes it more difficult to build trust in immigrant communities, where they want residents to feel comfortable offering tips and reporting crimes. They also argue that holding foreigners in jail at the request of immigration authorities could force them to keep inmates longer than is permitted under the Constitution. Earlier this year, a federal judge blocked an executive order aimed at withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities. With the new policy on the Byrne grants, the Justice Department has tried to take a more modest, and potentially more legally defensible, step toward penalizing such communities. If allowed to go into effect, the new policy would begin in September. The conflict puts Trump in something of a bind over conflicting priorities. While he has taken a hard-line stance against sanctuary cities, he also has tried to show that he is committed to fighting urban crime \u2014 a goal he has often emphasized by highlighting Chicago\u2019s homicide rate, the highest in the nation at more than 400 killings so far this year. At one point, Trump proposed using federal resources to rein in the violence. Any attempt to withhold public safety funds from that city would seem to go against that parallel effort. Chicago received $2.3 million last year through the grant program, funds that in the past the city has used to purchase SWAT equipment, police vehicles, radios and stun guns. It\u2019s a relatively small amount of money for one of the largest cities in the country, but Chicago officials said the fight centers on \u201cstanding up to this administration that\u2019s trying to make us make this awful choice that we don\u2019t think is lawful and constitutional, and also keep them from doing this to other grants,\u201d said Shannon Breymaier, a spokeswoman for Emanuel. In the lawsuit, Chicago officials said the new conditions the Justice Department seeks to impose \u201cwould give federal officials the power to enter city facilities and interrogate arrestees at will and would force the City to detain individuals longer than justified by probable cause, solely to permit federal officials to investigate their immigration status.\u201d That would conflict with Chicago\u2019s \u201cwelcoming cities\u201d ordinance, which prioritizes crime prevention and local law enforcement over federal immigration enforcement, and potentially would force them to violate the constitutional rights of foreigners held in city jails, the lawsuit says. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday that Chicago has a policy that obstructs the nation\u2019s immigration system and has \u201cdemonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement \u2014 Federal, state, and local \u2014 and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents.\u201d Sessions said in a statement that Chicago needs to recommit to the rule of law and to policies that roll back \u201cthe culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.\u201d \u201cThis administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cSo it\u2019s this simple: Comply with the law or forego taxpayer dollars.\u201d", "Title: Denver fights back against Trump\u2019s deportation crackdown with surprisingly simple change in law Content: As the Trump administration\u2019s war on \u201csanctuary cities\u201d heats up, cities have come up with increasingly creative ways to fight back. The latest example comes from Denver, which just passed a law aimed at protecting legal immigrants from being deported for committing relatively petty crimes, those carrying maximum sentences of 365 days \u2014 the federal government\u2019s tripwire for kicking people out. The city\u2019s solution? Simply take a bunch of those relatively petty offenses and reduce the maximum penalty to less than 365 days. Just like that, the move takes the crimes (and their perpetrators) off the radar of immigration authorities. It\u2019s not a novel approach to protecting immigrants, but coming as a direct response to President Trump\u2019s crackdown, it\u2019s particularly timely. The action does not affect more serious crimes and does not protect undocumented immigrants. Under federal law, an immigrant living in the United States legally can be deported for committing a low-level crime, like shoplifting or trespassing, as long as that offense carries a potential sentence of one year. This means that even someone living in the country with a green card or student visa can be flagged to immigration officials \u2014 and deported \u2014 for such misdemeanors. Tens of thousands of legal residents have been deported for relatively minor offenses in recent decades. But under previous administrations, immigration authorities have often let low-level offenders off the hook. Now, under Trump, immigrants feel the threat of deportation more than ever, advocates say, whether they are residing here legally or not. The proposal passed Denver\u2019s city council Monday night. In making the change, Denver is sending a clear message to the federal government that it will not \u201cbend to a broken immigration system,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Michael Hancock, who proposed the sentencing revisions. They will help \u201ckeep families together by ensuring low level offenses, like park curfew, are not a deportation tool,\u201d he said. Previously, nearly all municipal crimes in Denver carried a maximum sentence of 365 days. But under the new approach, that maximum year-long sentence is only reserved for seven of the most serious offenses, including violent assaults and repeated domestic violence. Crimes including shoplifting, trespassing, the first or second instance of domestic violence, and simple assault will now be eligible for a maximum 300 days in jail. Even pettier offenses, such as public urination, and curfew violations would merit up to 60 days. \u201cOver the past four months, the White House has issued a series of executive orders that have exacerbated our broken immigration system and have had a real impact on our community,\u201d Hancock said in a statement. \u201cI have heard from many who are rightfully concerned. Denver is committed to taking actions that will protect our people\u2019s rights and keep our city safe, welcoming and open.\u201d Denver is just one of dozens of cities and states across the country doing battle with Trump administration executive orders aimed at cracking down on immigration and travel. Suits brought by cities and states against the orders have tied them up in courts for the time being. In response to a court order blocking the administration\u2019s attempt to strip funding from \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d a memo released by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday offered the government\u2019s first official definition: Sessions said sanctuary cities are those that violate a federal law requiring local and state governments to share information with federal officials about immigrants\u2019 citizenship or legal status. Although Denver notifies Immigration and Customs Enforcement of impending releases of immigrants from jail upon request, it is one of many cities across the country that has declined to hold inmates for ICE if they otherwise are eligible for release. Yet despite Hancock\u2019s efforts to push policies that protect immigrants, the mayor has refrained from calling Denver a \u201csanctuary city.\u201d \u201cThe mayor has literally said you can call us whatever you want,\u201d Amber Miller, communications director for the mayor\u2019s office, told The Post. The term has \u201cno legal meaning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are operating in a very vague environment right now,\u201d Miller said. The mayor is \u201cfocusing on taking real actions that will actually impact people\u2019s safety,\u201d she said. \u201cLabels don\u2019t get you that.\u201d The mayor acknowledged that many will hear about the changes and feel that he is advocating for illegal behavior. But he said, \u201cit is the right and the duty of any individual in this city to report crime without fear of being punished. We want and need Denver residents to trust local law enforcement.\u201d \u201cThis is not about shielding violent people,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cI will not play political games with the safety of our community.\u201d This would remove Denver from the \u201cbusiness of immigration enforcement,\u201d Julie Gonzales, the policy director for the Meyer Law Office, a Denver firm that specializes in immigration cases, told the newspaper. The sentencing revisions, the mayor said, go \u201chand in hand\u201d with a new system established in recent weeks allowing people to resolve traffic tickets by mail. Undocumented immigrants, particularly in recent months, have grown hesitant about interacting with public safety officials and going into courthouses. Their fears are justified, Miller said. \u201cWe are seeing ICE at our courts more and more looking to pick up undocumented immigrants,\u201d he said. As a result, many people aren\u2019t taking care of their traffic infractions, which only get worse over time. \u201cWe know many hard-working immigrants are afraid to come to the courthouse right now,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cBut avoiding court dates or failing to resolve tickets is not the answer.\u201d This is not the first time local officials and immigration advocates nationwide have pushed for such sentencing changes. \u201cSince then, we have experienced a deportation frenzy,\u201d Kanstroom wrote. In addition to millions of undocumented deportees, tens of thousands of legal residents have been deported as \u201caggravated felons\u201d for state misdemeanors like shoplifting or for minor drug offenses, he added. So for many advocates, Kyle Huelsman, the policy manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, Denver has taken a positive step, he told the Denver Post. \u201cCreating automatic deportation as punishment is not a punishment we want to endorse,\u201d he said.", "Title: The DOJ\u2019s $27.7 billion budget reflects Jeff Sessions\u2019s priorities Content: The Justice Department\u2019s $27.7 billion budget reflects Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s priorities of being tough on crime and cracking down on illegal immigration, with millions of additional dollars going toward fighting violent crime and increasing the number of immigration judges and lawyers working on border security. The department\u2019s proposal also indicates that Justice officials could withhold grants or other funding for \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities, but it did not specify which programs could be affected. In its budget, the FBI will receive a 3 percent increase, of $249 million, including $61 million more to fight terrorism and combat foreign intelligence and cyberthreats, $31 million for biometric research, and $9 million for firearms-purchase background checks and violent crime data. The Justice Department is asking for an additional $175 million to target \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d criminal organizations and drug traffickers. Sessions, who as a senator vigorously opposed all efforts to reform the U.S. immigration system in ways to benefit those in the country illegally, now leads a department that has proposed almost $80 million \u2014 or\u00ad 19 percent \u2014 more to hire 75 additional immigration judge teams to adjudicate removal proceedings. The department also proposes enhancing border security and immigration enforcement by adding 60 border prosecutors, 40 deputy U.S. marshals and 20 attorneys to pursue efforts to obtain land to secure the Southwest border. An additional outlay of $171 million would go toward more short-term detention space for federal detainees. The $27.7 billion for the Justice Department represents a decrease of $1 billion, or 3.8 percent, from last year\u2019s budget. The department wants to eliminate about $700 million in unnamed \u201coutdated programs.\u201d One program on the chopping block reimburses state and local governments for the costs of incarcerating unauthorized immigrants. Eliminating the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program would save $210 million, but it may face resistance in Congress and from local officials. The Obama administration tried to trim or cancel the program, but it has survived. About $1 billion will be saved this year in federal prison construction spending because of the 14 percent decrease in the prison population since 2013.", "Title: Immigrants take guilty pleas without lawyers and can later be deported Content: Luis Bladilir Lopez would have needed a sharp defense lawyer to explain what could happen as the result of pleading guilty to a misdemeanor marijuana charge last year in Prince William County. But Lopez, then 19, was never appointed a lawyer, according to court records. In the end, the consequences were far more serious than he probably could have imagined. As soon as he entered a guilty plea, the federal government had strong grounds to deport him \u2014 and did so two months later. Immigration lawyers and advocates say Lopez\u2019s fate has become commonplace. In Virginia, and across the country, illegal immigrants who are convicted of minor, non-violent crimes often find themselves lumped in with violent offenders and deported under highly complex federal immigration procedures even as the Obama administration works to improve immigration enforcement procedures and focus on more serious offenders. In 2010, many commonwealth\u2019s attorneys across Virginia began automatically waiving jail time for mostly minor, misdemeanor offenses to save money. When prosecutors automatically waive jail time, judges no longer have to provide defendants with lawyers, potentially saving the state millions of dollars. So it was with Lopez, who entered the country illegally in 2005, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Neither he nor his family could be reached for further comment. Prince William Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Paul B. Ebert (D) had automatically waived all jail time for misdemeanor marijuana possession and a host of other charges. That made it possible for the General District Court judge in Lopez\u2019s case to negotiate a guilty plea without appointing a lawyer: All Lopez had to do was pay a $186 fine and forfeit his driver\u2019s license for six months. The Catch-22: Under federal law, illegal immigrants convicted of drug offenses are more likely to be deported, which is something defense lawyers are now required to explain. But Lopez didn\u2019t have a lawyer, according to court records. Advocates contend that prosecutors and judges in Virginia are essentially setting deportation traps for illegal immigrants charged with minor crimes by offering plea deals after waiving jail time and declining to appoint defense counsel. \u201cWhere do they get off trying to get an uncounseled criminal defendant to plead guilty before they get a lawyer?\u201d asked Victor M. Glasberg, an Alexandria civil rights lawyer who raised the issue with the Virginia Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s knowingly aimed at the Latino community, and it is part of Prince William\u2019s ethnic cleansing program. [Judges] know the law.\u201d Prosecutors and judges flatly deny the accusation, saying that jail time for many nonviolent offenders makes no sense, that their budget pressures are real \u2014 and that they are not responsible for whatever federal immigration problems defendants may have. Underlying the debate is _ Padilla v. Kentucky _, a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the justices ruled that criminal defense lawyers must advise clients who are not U.S. citizens that they could be deported because of a guilty plea. Some advocates say those standards should apply to judges or prosecutors when no lawyers are present. Prosecutors say the Virginia Association of Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys was paying attention only to budget concerns when it proposed legislation in 2010 waiving jail time for certain misdemeanor crimes. The bill faced opposition and died in the General Assembly, said Mike Doucette, the commonwealth\u2019s attorney in Lynchburg, who leads the association. But legislators still wanted prosecutors to try to save the state money, saying that prosecutors\u2019 compensation would not be cut as significantly if they could find dollars. In response, many individual commonwealth\u2019s attorneys told General District courts that they would automatically waive jail time on their own for certain crimes, obviating the need to appoint counsel in many cases, Doucette said. He and others, including Ebert, have reserved the right to pursue jail time in certain cases even as they waive it most of the time. Meanwhile, courts have not said state judges are required to appoint counsel for indigent defendants facing potential federal immigration charges. \u201cIt may be desirable, but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s desirable in these tough economic times we\u2019re not able to do,\u201d Doucette said. Ebert said that he was unaware that unrepresented defendants pleading guilty to misdemeanors without facing jail time could be deported or face other immigration-related consequences. When defendants who are represented by counsel look to work out a deal on the grounds that the immigration-related consequences are more severe than the crime, Ebert said he listens and sometimes tries to work out a deal. Generally, though, he said that\u2019s not his job. \u201cAs a matter of principle, the commonwealth attorney\u2019s office can\u2019t be concerned about what happens to an illegal immigrant,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t really concern yourself about what the federal implications are.\u201d Prince William General District Court Chief Judge Peter W. Steketee did not respond to requests for comment. William E. Jarvis, a Prince William General District Court judge who until October was a prosecutor in that county, said that there was no ill will on the part of Prince William\u2019s judges or prosecutors toward immigrant defendants. \u201cWe\u2019re slow to change, period,\u201d Jarvis said of the judicial system. \u201cI can tell you with absolute certainty . . . there was no systematic plan on treating [immigrants] differently.\u201d He said some judges will now appoint state-funded defense lawyers when documents indicate that a defendant is subject to a \u201cdetainer,\u201d or hold, from ICE. However, it is not a policy of the court, he said. Mark Voss, a criminal defense lawyer who represents many undocumented immigrants in Prince William, said some judges have begun to appoint lawyers in minor criminal cases in which defendants also have federal immigration issues. Judges, he said, should have been more aware of immigration consequences in the first place. Prince William, one of the first in the country to crack down on illegal immigrants locally, participates in a partnership with federal immigration authorities, known as 287 (g), in which local jail officials can place a detainer and hold an undocumented immigrant on behalf of federal immigration authorities. After Glasberg, the Alexandria civil rights lawyer, complained about the way Lopez and others who lacked counsel had been deported after agreeing to misdemeanor guilty pleas, the Virginia Supreme Court last month began requiring the use of new forms when defendants waive their right to a lawyer. The new forms warn defendants of the consequences of pleading guilty, including deportation and other federal immigration impacts. But Glasberg said the new forms are required to be given only to those who waive their right to a lawyer \u2014 not those like Lopez, who, because they faced no jail time, were never provided counsel. Eddie Macon, a Virginia Supreme Court administrative official, said individual judges have discretion about whether to provide the form or inform defendants when immigration consequences are on the line. Nationwide, New York City has become a model for dealing fairly with criminal defendants\u2019 immigration issues. There, the public defender's office has immigration lawyers who work in-house to deal with immigration issues. But many other jurisdictions, immigration advocates say, have struggled to implement fairer procedures in the wake of _Padilla._ __ \u201cThe punishment should fit the crime \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t always result in banishment and separation from family,\u201d said Laura Lichter, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not about giving somebody preference in the actual process. It\u2019s about making sure people understand what\u2019s at stake. This part of the system has to be fair.\u201d **** ****", "Title: Sessions tells prosecutors to bring more cases against those entering U.S. illegally Content: Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prosecutors across the country Tuesday to make immigration cases a higher priority and look for opportunities to bring serious felony charges against those who cross the border illegally \u2014 the latest in a string of controversial maneuvers to crack down on illegal entry into the United States and expand the Justice Department\u2019s role in immigration enforcement. In a three-page memo, Sessions directed each U.S. attorney to appoint a border security coordinator to oversee immigration prosecutions and to make immigration offenses \u2014 such as crossing the border illegally or harboring those who do \u2014 \u201chigher priorities.\u201d He told prosecutors to consider whether they could bring felony charges against those who had entered the United States illegally multiple times and to evaluate whether they could charge illegal immigrants with aggravated identity theft, which carries a mandatory two-year prison sentence. He said law enforcement would no longer catch and release undocumented immigrants taken into custody at the border. The directive signals a more aggressive posture on immigration issues than the Obama administration had taken. Advocates and legal analysts said it raises troubling questions about the Justice Department\u2019s intentions and its use of resources. \u201cWhich prosecutors and agents does he want to divert from the growing threats like terrorism, cybercrime, the opioid and heroin trade, organized crime and cartel activity?\u201d asked Jenny Durkan, who served as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Washington from 2009 to 2014. \u201cThe \u2018surge\u2019 philosophy always requires taking agents, money and prosecutors from other priorities. In fact, the cost of satisfying Washington will reduce the ability of every U.S. attorney to address the greatest threats in their communities.\u201d Sessions touted the changes in Nogales, Ariz., on Tuesday as he toured the U.S.-Mexico border crossing there, about 70 miles south of Tucson. In a speech, he derided violent cartel and gang members and those smuggling people across the border, and he promised to take a stand against them. He said illegal border crossings have declined significantly since President Trump took office \u2014 dropping 40 percent from January to February and 72 percent from December to March. Such crossings, though, also have decreased in recent years, and some researchers say demographic and economic factors have more influence than border security on the volume. \u201cAs you know too well, this is a booming business. No more,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cWe are going to shut down and jail those who have been profiting off this lawlessness \u2014 smuggling gang members across the border, helping convicted criminals re-enter the country, and preying on those who don\u2019t know how dangerous and costly this journey can be.\u201d The Trump administration \u2014 and Sessions in particular \u2014 has taken a hard-line stance on immigration, alarming activists who say U.S. officials are testing legal boundaries and implementing policies contrary to American values. Sessions last month threatened to strip federal funding from cities that did not communicate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and he signed a letter with Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly backing the practice of arresting undocumented immigrants at courthouses. He also announced that he would expand a program to deport undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes after they serve their prison sentences, and he said Tuesday that he would increase the number of immigration judges to speed the removal of others. Already, Sessions said, the Justice Department has posted 25 immigration judges in detention centers along the border, and he plans to add 125 more over the next two years. Those judges, though, handle deportation proceedings \u2014 not criminal cases. \u201cThis is a new era,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThis is the Trump era.\u201d Paul K. Charlton, the U.S. attorney for Arizona from 2001 to 2007, said Sessions\u2019s new directive would simply overburden the U.S. district court system, which is already struggling to handle the volume of immigration cases. He said that when he was U.S. attorney, his office had the highest number of prosecutions in the country, \u201cyet the number of people entering illegally did not dramatically decrease.\u201d \u201cNo one understands better than I do that prosecutions have a deterrent effect, but it\u2019s not a solution. Prosecution and incarceration do not adequately address the real need, which is a reform of the immigration laws,\u201d Charlton said. As a senator, Sessions vigorously opposed immigration law reform. Sessions\u2019s memo offers blanket guidance to beef up enforcement, though it is somewhat short on specifics \u2014 omitting, for example, how to handle those coming to the United States with their children or those fleeing persecution, said Leon Fresco, who worked in the office of immigration litigation in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. The Justice Department, Fresco said, could slap asylum seekers with identity theft charges merely for using fake passports to get out of a country that otherwise would not have let them leave, or could jail parents who cross the border with their kids \u2014 breaking up the family. That would run counter to the assertion by the homeland security secretary that officials will not separate children from their parents. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the memo that talks about the need to be careful about that,\u201d Fresco said.

Tech experiment Content: This spring, you may see and smell fewer of those foul stink bug pests, and you can thank the polar vortex. The punishing, prolonged blasts of arctic air this January proved too much for most stinkbugs to overcome according to Virginia Tech field researchers. Each fall, Virginia Tech entomology professor Thomas Kuhar and his team gather stink bugs that congregate on the outside of buildings. The stink bugs are put into ventilated 5-gallon buckets filled with foam insulation tubes and then the buckets are stored outside for the winter, under a shelter. Each bucket contains about 100 stink bugs. The insulated buckets simulated the overwintering locations of stink bugs. The bucket arrangements also help to keep the bugs in a dormant state of diapause while they await experiments in Kuhar\u2019s Virginia Tech lab. Stink bugs prefer to spend the winter under shingles, in attics, or in the walls of houses and office buildings. As the temperature falls, the stink bugs change their physiology by increasing their cryoprotectants (antifreeze proteins) to prevent their body fluids from crystallizing. This helps the bugs survive the winter\u2019s sub-freezing temperatures. The presence of stink bugs in the Washington, D.C. area was confirmed in 2007. From 2007 to 2009, the bugs reproduced rapidly. The stink bugs became a problem in this area in 2010. The bug problem has continued to increase throughout the greater D.C. area in recent years. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Since the stink bug explosion, we\u2019ve not had a severely cold winter to test their overwintering tenacity. It was not even known if a Mid-Atlantic winter could be cold enough to freeze the bugs. Stink bugs had survived lab tests where the temperature was reduced to near -20 C (-4 F). Last month, Arctic air intrusions touted by the press as the \u201cPolar Vortex\u201d chilled much of the country. In the Washington area, the temperature dropped to near the same level as the stink bug lab tests, to around zero, but the cold across the area persisted for many days. Some of us stink bug haters wondered if the prolonged arctic freeze would impact the overwintering bugs? *[WSU]: Wayne State University Two weeks ago, Professor Kuhar pulled out his first set of insulated buckets for stink bug experiments. Kuhar and his staff found that within the buckets of bugs there was a 95% kill rate from the sustained cold weather that occurred in January in Blacksburg (which is slightly colder than Washington). The little stinkers had frozen to death! So, it does appear that the stink bugs have a freezing point. As a result of the high kill rate, Kuhar concluded, \u201cThere should be significant mortality of BMSB (brown marmorated stink bugs) and many other overwinter insects this year.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University Will there be a noticeable drop in the stink bug numbers this spring? Will there be less crop-related problems from stink bugs during the 2014 growing season? Will we see less stink bugs trying to hibernate in our homes next fall? If we have another strong Polar Vortex chill, will it further reduce the stink bug numbers this year? Only time will tell \u2013 but these initial test results are promising. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Have you noticed less stink bug activity in your home or office after the cold blasts that occurred in January?

The comeback would come two years after many farmers throughout the Mid-Atlantic states saw their crops extensively damaged by swarms of the brown, shield-shaped insects. The stink bugs, known to feed on more than 300 varieties of host plants, resulted in about $37 million in losses from damage to apple crops alone in 2010; crops of raspberries and blackberries were also ravaged, and many organic farmers saw significant damage to crops of tomatoes, peppers and beans, experts reported. Lawmakers, entomologists and the agricultural community scrambled for a solution to a problem that was only expected to worsen. The Environmental Protection Agency in 2011 approved an exemption for a highly toxic insecticide to help growers fight the insects. Homeowners braced themselves for the unwelcome presence of the bugs, which seek sheltered places \u2014 such as houses, garages and barns \u2014 to hibernate for the winter. Farmers prepared for another year of battle in their fields, orchards and vineyards. But then scientists and farmers alike noticed a sudden and dramatic decrease in the number of stink bugs during the fall of 2011. ****Entomologists are still unsure how to explain the change. It\u2019s possible, they said, that a succession of strong storms late that summer culled the population. **** \u201cJust when it was getting really bad, it started getting better,\u201d said Doug Fabbioli, a fruit grower and winemaker who owns Fabbioli Cellars in Leesburg. ****************But now, scientists caution, the insects appear to be resurgent. Christopher Bergh, a Virginia Tech associate professor of entomology, said the overwintering population of bugs this past fall was \u201csubstantially larger\u201d than that observed in 2011. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise any red flags unnecessarily,\u201d he said. \u201cBut growers are going to definitely need to remain vigilant starting in the 2013 season.\u201d Bergh said the early arrival of spring last year also helped farmers and growers avoid the worst of the bugs; many early-season crops got a head start on the insects, which then emerged in smaller numbers. \u201cThere was less opportunity for them to do damage,\u201d he said. But Tracy Leskey, a research entomologist with the Agriculture Department, said the reduced population of bugs \u201cessentially rebounded over the course of the growing season\u201d last year, and homeowners saw far more bugs come inside to spend the winter than they did the year before. \u201cWe have been trapping in the late season, and we know the populations are probably at least 60 percent greater this year compared to [2011],\u201d she said. \u201cIf they survive over the winter, there will be many more bugs in the spring.\u201d At Butler\u2019s Orchard in Germantown, co-owner Wade Butler said he and other employees discovered swarms of the insects recently while working in one of the farm\u2019s open barns. \u201cBetween two boards or two pieces of wood, you\u2019d see a couple of hundred stink bugs there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of surprising.\u201d Still, he said, he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the coming year might not be so terrible. \u201cThe numbers came back up some [in the fall], but we were better prepared to meet that challenge,\u201d he said. Fabbioli, the Leesburg vintner, said he noticed a large number of second-generation, young bugs in the autumn, a shift from the previous year. \u201cWe may be having some trouble [this year],\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they\u2019re wrong, but it definitely was more this fall \u2014 not as far as the damage to the fruit, but just visually, how many bugs you saw.\u201d As residents, farmers and growers have welcomed the respite from the stink bugs, entomologists have been busy continuing their researching, Leskey said. Much about the bugs is still unknown, and scientists are eager to better understand the environmental conditions and natural predators that might affect the insect\u2019s population. \u201cWe are finding that there are a number of different predators and parasites that are attacking them, and it varies according to the different crops and landscapes,\u201d Leskey said. Despite the progress of ongoing research, Bergh said, the region is \u201cnot out of the woods.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t see any pronounced indications of natural enemies suppressing brown marmorated stink bug populations as effectively as we would need to breathe a sigh of relief,\u201d he said. Leskey noted one hopeful development: Within the past year, scientists have identified and synthesized a pheromone emitted by the bug. Traps baited with the synthetic compound serve as an effective lure, allowing scientists and farmers to better detect their presence, she said. \u201cThat tells growers that the bugs are in the area. It\u2019s an early warning tool, so they know that they need to make management decisions\u201d such as whether to apply insecticides, she said. Beyond serving as a warning system for farmers, Leskey said identifying the pheromone will also let entomologists more effectively track the population, movement and activity of stink bugs throughout the season \u2014 opening the door to a deeper understanding of the insects and how to control them. \u201cWe\u2019ll start to be able to look at their seasonal patterns and better understand what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really exciting development.\u201d", "Title: It\u2019s stink bug season again, and the bugs are wanted! Content: The weather has warmed and stink bugs are currently emerging from their overwintering locations in our attics and walls. As always, stink bugs are unwelcomed visitors in our homes \u2014 but his year the stinky pests are _wanted_ by the University of Maryland. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cWe really need stink bugs and the best place to collect them this time of year is in homes,\u201d said Galen Dively, professor emeritus at Maryland\u2019s Department of Entomology. The scientists need thousands of live stink bugs to re-stock a laboratory colony that died last fall. Roughly 13,000 stink bugs in the lab died from a suspected virus that caused the entire colony to collapse. Stink bugs can be collected in plastic food containers. Dively suggests throwing a piece of apple in the container to give the bugs food and poking holes in the container\u2019s lid to give the bugs fresh air. If you collect more than several dozen bugs, contact the research lab on the College Park campus by email (galen@umd.edu). So far, one household has collected more than a thousand stink bugs for the research effort. And you thought your house had the bugs bad! This past week, I had the opportunity to interview Galen Dively about his stink bug research and a some tips for home stink bug prevention. Below is my interview: **Kevin Ambrose (KA)** : **Can the suspected virus be used to combat the stink bug in the future?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Galen Dively (GD): We\u2019re not sure yet if the cause of death is a virus or a fungus. Virus sprays are often not effective against bugs but once we identify the cause of the colony collapse then research will be done to see if there are other methods to combat the stink bug. **KA: Do you think the past two cold winters thinned the population of stink bugs in the Washington area?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: Yes, although this invasive species of stink bug is from a region in China that has similar climates in the Washington area, the unusual cold temperatures have undoubtedly reduced the overwintering success of adults in sheltered areas outside of dwellings. Besides overwintering inside dwellings, we know they also overwinter under the bark of the standing or fallen dead trees in wooded areas. In fact, the sheltered situations outside is probably the main site of overwintering in many areas. **KA: We\u2019ve received information from our CWG readers that the stink bugs are worse in the counties to the west of Washington. Where is the stink bug epicenter in our region?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: The highest populations of stink bugs are located in Central and Western Maryland, Northern Virginia, the northeastern counties of West Virginia. Infestations are highest in houses and other dwellings surrounded by trees and close to soybean fields where they tend to feed late in the fall to build up their energy stores for overwintering. **KA: Why do you think the stink bugs are not a major problem on the Eastern Shore where there is plenty of agriculture?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: This insect prefers landscapes that are fragmented with woodlots, agricultural fields (particularly corn and soybean), and dwellings. At a larger scale, high temperature is a limiting factor. The landscape on the Eastern Shore is less fragmented, larger cleared areas with contiguous crop fields, fewer woodlots and dwellings per land area; and summer temperatures are higher on the coastal plain area than in the Piedmont area. **KA: What are the major focus areas for your stink bug research**? *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: There are several research focuses as follows: 1) The female stink bug during egg laying smears fecal material on the eggs which contain a specific bacteria that the immature nymphs need for normal development and survival; we consider this as a weak link in its life history. Studies are ongoing to investigate ways to disrupt the development of the immature nymphs. 2) Rearing the stink bug is an essential requirement for ongoing research, so studies are focused on preventing colony crashes due to disease and the development of an artificial diet for the stink bug. 3) In its native land (China), the stink bug is maintained under control by natural enemies, mainly tiny wasps that parasitize the eggs. We have similar parasitic wasps that attack our native stink bugs and our studies are focused on whether these natural enemies will shift over to the invasive species of stink bug. In order to rear these natural enemies and conduct research on their potential as natural control agents, our studies need stink bug egg masses from the colony. 4) In addition, several studies are conducted during the growing season to evaluate chemical, biological, and cultural control measures for the stink bug. **KA: I know that stink bugs are attracted to home gardens in the summer. What vegetables and plants do the stink bugs prefer?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: They prefer tomatoes, peppers (all types except the really hot Thai varieties), okra, sweet corn, green beans, and eggplant. Less preferred are the vegetables in the cabbage family and cucurbits (cucumber, melons, pumpkin, and squash). They also feed on large and small fruit crops. **KA: Do you have any tips for making a home stink bug-proof, or at least reducing the number of bugs that enter a house?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: Caulk all cracks and spaces that can serve as entry portals, make sure there are no holes in windows screens and screen covers of vents in the attic, weather stripping around doors to prevent entry, and seal openings around window AC units. **KA: Do you foresee any new plans or methods to combat the stink bug with insecticides, stink bug eating wasps, or traps?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico GD: The parasitic wasps probably have the greatest potential for long-term control of this invasive stink bug. USDA has brought back several species from China and are currently studying their potential non-target effects in quarantine populations, before they are released if allowed at all. One exotic species from China has been carefully tested for about three years, and USDA was about ready to petition for its release; but to our surprise, this species was found occurring naturally at Beltsville, Maryland late last summer, apparently introduced accidentally in containers, probably the same way the stink bug came into our country. Now, extensive surveys will be conducted this summer to determine if this parasitic wasp survived the winter and is spreading its distribution range, and will it impact the stink bug population. For gardeners and organic farmers, the insecticides that are available to these users are not effective on the stink bug. We are investigating the use of attractive trap crops such as sunflower, grain sorghum and even okra. The idea is plant these crops close to or around a cash crop to divert stink bugs away from the cash crop. Traps are being used to monitor flight activity but so far have not proved to be effective trap and kill strategies. In fruit production, there is promise of using pheromone traps in a \u2018baited\u2019 tree at the edge of the orchard to concentrate invading stink bugs in one spot and then kill them with an effective insecticide. We do have a number of good conventional insecticide products that are available to commercial farmers, but not homeowners for gardeners unless they have a pesticide application license. **Related:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico WANTED: STINK BUGS *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Stink bug meets spider (video) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Polar vortex exterminated 95 percent of stink bugs in Va.

Fortunately for you, a team of researchers at Virginia Tech recently concluded a two-year study of stinkbug eradication techniques and has found that a simple home-built method -- one weird trick! -- is both cheaper and more effective than several store-bought traps. John Aignar and Thomas Kuhar enlisted the aid of 16 Virginia households experiencing significant stinkbug infestations in 2012 and 2013. Over a 11-week period in the spring of each year, each household tested four different stinkbug traps -- two commercial traps, a homemade trap involving a 2-liter soda bottle made into a funnel, and a homemade trap consisting of a baking sheet full of soapy water left out on a countertop. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday All four traps operate under the same principle, using light to lure the bugs into the trap. And among the four, the pan of soapy water was the clear winner, killing 14 times as many stinkbugs as one of the store-bought traps. Best of all? Assuming you already own a lamp, a baking sheet and some dish detergent, the cost is essentially zero. The chart above shows the results from the 2012 season. While the Stube commercial trap performed admirably, it was still outshone by the water pan. The 2013 results show the same general distribution, although the Stube model was discontinued that year and was thus excluded from the analysis. \"Although this trap may not remove every stink bug from a building,\" the researchers wrote, \"it will provide a homeowner with some relief from their stink bug infestations, as well as a sense of satisfaction from removing large numbers of the bugs from their home.\" The trap is so simple the researchers were able to fit a complete \"how-to\" in the 22-second video tutorial below. While this technique works great at home, it won't scale well to the agricultural realm, where stinkbugs are responsible for millions of dollars' worth of crop damage annually. In 2010, for instance, mid-Atlantic apple growers lost upward of $37 million to the bug. Overall in the United States, roughly $40 _billion_ **** of crops are susceptible to stinkbug losses. \"We are only just beginning to realize the impact of this species because it has only recently spread to areas like the Pacific Northwest, with the tremendous acres of tree fruit production, and the high value specialty crops in California,\" co-author Kuhar wrote in an e-mail. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The jury's still out on whether this year's harsh winter killed off more of the bugs than usual. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday", "Title: It\u2019s stink bug season again: how bad are they where you live? (POLL) Content: The cicadas are long gone but the 2013-14 stink bug season is now upon us. Summer has transitioned to autumn which has sent stink bugs scurrying to hibernate inside of the walls and attics of our homes, apartments, and office buildings. When we get warm spells of weather, like during the past week, the stink bugs become active and emerge into the living spaces of homes. During cooler weather, the bugs settle down and don\u2019t move around as much. It\u2019s an ugly cycle that continues through the winter months as we experience thaws and freezes. If you\u2019re one of the unfortunate stink bug sufferers like me, you may have noticed the correlation of warm-ups and stink bug activity. Basically, warm fall and winter weather equates to more stink bugs buzzing around our dwellings. The stink bug continues to spread across the eastern United States from its first sighting in Allentown, Pennsylvania 15 years ago. Ohio is suffering as much as the Washington area and stink bugs have moved into North Carolina. The bugs have even spread across Long Island. Entomologists are stating that stink bugs will be with us for many years to come. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Recent stink bug reports from exterminating companies like HomeTeam Pest Defense indicate the stink bug issue is particularly bad in the counties west of D.C. I have a friend who lives near Front Royal and he confirmed the report and said the bugs have swarmed into his garage by the dozens during the past two weeks. *[WSU]: Wayne State University I thought it would be interesting to poll our readers to see which area in the Washington region has the worst stink bug problems.

The bugs are easy to catch and they don\u2019t bite. For most people, the bugs are a nuisance because they buzz around the house and crash into walls. If you sit still, they will even land on you. Throw in the fact that the bug is ugly and smelly, it ranks near the top on the home pest list. Stink bugs seem to prefer light colored homes, but there are plenty of examples of dark-colored homes with stink bugs. Landscape lighting and gardens also attract the bugs. When the weather cools and the days shorten, the bugs will seek out houses and find windows, doors, eaves, and soffits to use as portals of entry. It\u2019s amazing how the stink bug can squeeze through closed windows and extremely narrow gaps. I have found the best prevention for stink bugs is to seal and weatherstrip windows and doors, and caulk around wall fixtures that have gaps which provide an opening into the living area of a house.

Baker, president of the foundation. \u201cWe continue to have polluted water, risks to human health and lost jobs \u2014 at huge societal costs.\u201d The biennial report evaluates 13 measurements in three categories: pollution, habitat and fisheries. It gave the bay a score of 32, or a D-plus \u2014 the same it got two years ago. The Chesapeake\u2019s score has improved since Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D) took office \u2014 but only slightly. The foundation gave the bay a score of 28, or a D-minus, in 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re not happy about the score, but we\u2019re glad to see that it\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d Baker said. Baker said a major cause of pollution in the bay is an excess of phosphorus. That is largely due, he added, to tons of manure \u2014 much of it from chickens \u2014 that pollute creeks across the Eastern Shore, which has a large poultry industry. \u201cThe message is absolutely clear: Agriculture as a sector must do more. Agriculture is the largest sector of pollution coming into the bay, and fortunately it is the least expensive to control,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe need to get serious about controlling phosphorus.\u201d He added that the Eastern Shore is the only part of the state where \u201cour elected officials have continued to resist sound science by delaying new regulations to control chicken manure.\u201d Before O\u2019Malley leaves office this month, he plans to enact regulations intended to curb pollution from farms. Hogan has previously described the proposed rules as a \u201clast-minute fulfillment of a political promise to a special-interest group.\u201d A Hogan spokesman said in an e-mail that it\u2019s time for a new approach. The study released Monday \u201cis just the latest to conclude that the current strategy for restoring and protecting our greatest natural asset and America\u2019s largest estuary is not working,\u201d Adam Dubitsky said. He said Maryland farmers are well ahead of state and federal phosphorus, nitrogen and sediment reductions goals, while their counterparts in Pennsylvania and New York have yet to act in any meaningful way. Baker said water-quality indicators have improved by 10 percent since 2012. Dissolved oxygen and water clarity were responsible for the increase. The biggest declines were in fisheries, with the blue crab population dropping from 765 million to 297 million. The report said the number of adult female crabs dropped below the level considered depleted and forced states to cut back on catches to improve the chances of good reproduction. Rockfish are also down, but the number of oysters is up in Maryland. The bay-wide catch nearly hit 1 million bushels in the 2013-2014 season, the first time that benchmark has been approached since 1987, according to the report. Baker said members of the foundation look forward to working with Hogan to improve the bay and hope he will see the economic benefit it would bring to the state. Baker said that when he meets with Hogan, he plans to ask him to \u201cembrace and implement\u201d the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, which was established in 2010. It calls for a reduction in pollution to creeks, rivers and the bay and has been agreed upon by state and federal agencies and local governments. The report says the bay region is not on track to meet the blueprint\u2019s goal, which calls on state and local governments to achieve specific reductions. \u201cThe Clean Water Blueprint is in place and working, but there are danger signs ahead,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe would urge [Hogan] to look at that, understand it and go after it with every element of his administration.\u201d", "Title: The Chesapeake Bay\u2019s blue crab need our help now \u2014 or never Content: Two years ago, you could pretty much bank on it: Leave the dock at 5:30 or 6 a.m. and be back by 9 with a bushel or so of scrappy male crabs. Then it was just a matter of hooking up the cooker, herding the crabs into the steamer and sitting back for the 25 minutes or so it takes to turn them red and scrumptious. In the evening it was crabs for six or eight or however many you could gather, followed by a picking session that left you with a pound or two of flaky white meat for crabcakes. That was the norm, from June to September, as it had been for the decade or more since I took up crabbing and for a century before that. Sometimes it was more than a bushel, sometimes less, but always there was a proper mess for supper if you took the trouble to go out. Last year the bottom fell out. No one is quite sure why, but after an initial run in June, the crabs went scarce. It was eerie, because even in mediocre crabbing years, you catch a lot of little throwbacks, and in the fall there were always many females, which recreational crabbers are required to toss back for conservation. (Commercial crabbers, for inscrutable reasons, are allowed to keep females.) By last July and August, my Annapolis trotlining partner, Gene Miller, and I had scaled down our aspirations, but we still went. Instead of a bushel, we\u2019d shoot to catch a dozen or dozen and a half of good jimmies, enough for lunch. I talked to recreational crabbers around the Chesapeake who had come to the same decision, and no one was complaining. They weren\u2019t going hungry. It\u2019s a sport. But they shared the same deep foreboding. If there were no little ones, and hardly any females, what would 2014 bring? The answer is now in hand: Nothing. No crabs. The last signature species of the Chesapeake to withstand the pressures of overexploitation and declining habitat has all but disappeared from the waters around Annapolis, which locals still affectionately call Crabtown. Reports from elsewhere are no better. Like oysters, shad, herring, rockfish and yellow perch, crabs have vanished. Aha! you say, but didn\u2019t yellow perch and rockfish recover from near annihilation after draconian measures were taken to reduce the catch of both, including a five-year moratorium on fishing for rock in the 1980s? And what about Canada geese? Weren\u2019t they on the verge of disappearing, too, before Maryland shut down hunting in the 1990s? Good ideas have a way of working out, and the time has come to stop pussyfooting around and shut down crabbing for a few years, to give the delectable crustaceans a chance to recover the way geese, yellow perch and rockfish did. This idea will not go over well with the people who make their living by catching, cooking, serving, picking and selling the \u201cbeautiful swimmers\u201d that William Warner won a Pulitzer Prize writing so eloquently about. But if somebody doesn\u2019t stop them soon, they\u2019re all going to be out of business anyway, like the Chesapeake shad and herring fishermen and oystermen of long ago. The good news is that there are still crabs around and that they are a remarkably resilient species. The life cycle is short and their reproductive capacity so vigorous that we could have abundances back within a year or two, if we just leave them alone. Among the most extraordinary political steps taken was Maryland Gov. Harry Hughes\u2019s unilateral declaration of a rockfish moratorium when faced with becoming the villain on whose watch the Maryland state fish went under. Can we expect that kind of courage from Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D)? Don\u2019t expect anything brave from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which seems to spend all its time mapping fundraising strategies so it can build a new wing on the palace on the bay it calls headquarters. A look at CBF\u2019s Web site reveals not one word about this summer\u2019s collapse of the blue crab. Is it even aware? We have all watched critical Chesapeake resources dwindle to nothing, victims of declining habitat and ever more efficient methods of exploitation. At some point, these resources either go away or somebody puts up a hand and says: Stop! With blue crabs, that time is now \u2014 or never. **Read more about this issue:** Donald Boesch: On the Chesapeake Bay cleanup, agribusiness tries to muddy the waters Peter Galuszka: A horror film starring the Chesapeake Bay The Post\u2019s View: A market to save the Chesapeake Bay", "Title: As blue crabs rebound, Maryland takes chefs on field trips to promote them Content: Born and raised in Los Angeles, chef Ben Small had an outsider\u2019s view of the Maryland blue crab. It came in a little plastic bucket, all meat and no claws, the shell ripped away long before it was shipped to the front door of the restaurant. But on a recent Friday, Small\u2019s perspective changed. He bobbed and weaved in a boat on the Choptank River, off Cambridge on the Eastern Shore, the blue crabs\u2019 front door. Newly relocated to the District, he was eager to see the living crab, to learn about its biology, and to understand why his restaurant, the Source at the Newseum, should buy local shellfish, showcase it on the menu and help sustain it. The field trip was courtesy of a fledgling effort by Maryland to pull chefs out of kitchens to behold the crabs in their Chesapeake Bay habitat and persuade them to buy the local product. Over the Memorial Day weekend, state officials also planned to launch a program called \u201cTrue Blue,\u201d to help consumers distinguish which restaurants use the Chesapeake Bay product for their Maryland crab cakes as opposed to using those imported from nations such as Venezuela and the Philippines. Forty restaurants have volunteered for the program, which allows participants to display a \u201cTrue Blue\u201d crab logo with the state flag on their menus if they agree to inspections, according to Bay Daily, a Chesapeake Bay Foundation publication. More than 300 chefs and retail seafood managers who had shunned pricier blue crabs have journeyed out to watch watermen pull wildlife from the Chesapeake Bay, said Steve Vilnit, director of Fisheries Marketing for the state Department of Natural Resources who runs the two-year-old program. Small\u2019s outing focused on blue crabs, which are making a major comeback in the bay. Maryland\u2019s and Virginia\u2019s governors recently announced the largest crab baby boom in almost two decades, from 207 million juvenile crabs last year to nearly 600 million this year, according to a yearly winter dredge survey conducted by the states. The growth followed Virginia\u2019s closure of the winter dredge season , when watermen dragged heavy traps along the marine floor, killing as many crabs as they caught. The dead were mostly pregnant female crabs. The overall population, estimated at a low of about 250 million when the winter dredge closed in 2007, is now more than 750 million. Seafood wholesalers hope that driving up the blue crab population will drive down their price. Maryland crabs cost about $5 per pound more than crabs from Latin America and Asia. On a bright, blue day, Small sailed with a 72-year-old waterman, watched highly skilled workers handpick steamed flesh from the shells of thousands of crabs at a processing plant, and listened to a sales pitch promoting the Maryland blue crab as unique \u2014 superior to its skinnier cousins from overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome for me to see the source, where it comes from. I understand the beast more,\u201d Small said. \u201cWhen I was cooking in L.A., we got the Maryland crab, but it was delivered. I was in Virginia one time and saw a blue crab skitter in the water and it was the craziest thing for me.\u201d \u201cI understand it more,\u201d Small said as he headed back across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in a van. \u201cSeeing those workers pick the meat shows you how much love goes into the crab. It\u2019s the whole cycle. It helps me understand the bigger picture.\u201d On the boat with Small, John Rorapaugh, director of sustainability, green initiatives and sales for ProFish, a D.C.-based seafood supplier, could not stand still. \u201cI love fresh seafood, man \u2014 at its freshest,\u201d he blurted out. \u201cI\u2019m a seafood geek. This excites me!\u201d Rorapaugh said the promotion of blue crab meat in the two-year program has had a positive effect on his business. Three years ago, ProFish sold about 500 pounds of crab meat to clients from New Jersey to Norfolk. Last year it sold more than 38,000 pounds in five months. \u201cWe want them to see why you should buy the Maryland crab,\u201d Rorapaugh said. There\u2019s no other crab like it, he said. To keep warm in the winter, Maryland crabs store fat, the yellow in their white meat. \u201cThat\u2019s what gives the crab a different taste,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a richness to it. Fat in any recipe has a richness. If you use Venezuelan meat, the crab will be tasty, but it won\u2019t have that richness.\u201d Small said the fat is his favorite part of the blue crab. \u201cI prefer to take a piece of bread and mop that fat out of the shell,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I found out they sold tubs of fat, I said, \u2018Oh, my God, I want that.\u2019 \u201d In the past, the Olney Grille restaurant in suburban Maryland had never used blue crab. But since owner Dan Hudson took the tour in September, the restaurant has used nothing but in its crab cakes. \u201cWe get it on Wednesday and it\u2019ll last a week. It\u2019s so fresh,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cFlavorwise, you can\u2019t even compare. All you have to do is open the lid and smell. It smells like the Chesapeake Bay.\u201d Hudson preferred crab from other countries because it was cheaper, about $15 per pound compared with Maryland blue crab at $20. At 500 pounds a month, \u201cit\u2019s a couple of thousand dollars extra cost,\u201d he said. A visit to J.M. Clayton, which processes crabs for retailers along the Atlantic seaboard, proved to Hudson that the crab was worth paying a little extra. He still uses other crab meat for bisque, a dip with spinach and atop sauteed rockfish, but not for cakes. \u201cTrue Blue\u201d is the brainchild of Vilnit, a former seafood wholesaler who used to hold invitation seminars where watermen explained seafood products and value to chefs. As a marketer for state natural resources, Vilnit put a new spin on that training. \u201cInstead of bringing the fishermen to the chef, we bring the chef to fishermen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chefs are usually very excited about going out there. They teach me things I might not expect.\u201d At J.M. Clayton, where women such as Charlotte Jones, 72, and Renee Denby, 41, remove meat by hand, chefs stare wide-eyed. Small said he had no idea that workers sit on stools for hours, carving lumps of crab meat with a tiny knife, to fill that bucket of crab meat that arrived at his restaurant in Los Angeles. He said he is now willing to pay extra for \u201cthe love that goes into the crab.\u201d And that is the point, Vilnit said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about the price at this time. It\u2019s about the story they can tell. They have a relationship with the crab.\u201d", "Title: Fishermen split over New Maryland rockfish quotas Content: Sharing is often considered a good thing. But ask fishermen to share their catch, especially of Maryland\u2019s state fish, and things can get testy \u2014 with seafood consumers on the hook for how it plays out. Maryland is changing the way striped bass are caught for sale, ending decades of regulating the popular Chesapeake Bay fish by limiting the times when it can be harvested. Starting Jan. 1, commercial fishermen will have individual quotas of striped bass they can catch almost any time, not just in the relative handful of days permitted this year. State officials say the change to catch shares, as the quotas are known, should help fishermen make a better living while improving oversight of harvests of the much-sought-after fish with distinctive black stripes \u2014 known popularly as rockfish. Some of the state\u2019s watermen welcome the flexibility of being allowed to fish when it suits them, rather than compete in all kinds of weather in one- or two-day fishing \u201cderbies.\u201d But others complain that the quotas rob them of initiative by limiting the amount they can catch, in some cases well below what they\u2019ve been landing lately. They warn that the cutback could drive them into oystering or other pursuits, making the tasty fish \u2014 a holiday staple for some \u2014 pricier and harder to come by in local restaurants and at seafood counters. \u201cBack in the old days \u2014 which wasn\u2019t really more than five or six years ago \u2014 we could fish five days a week and catch 1,200 pounds a day,\u201d said Don Marani, a commercial fisherman and proprietor of Don\u2019s Seafood in Fells Point. \u201cNow we can catch in a year what we used to be able to catch in a day. \u2026 I mean, rockfish is a great fish, but you can buy red snapper cheaper.\u201d At least one local chef, though, anticipates that the change will let his restaurant carry rockfish on the menu more frequently, and often at more reasonable prices. \u201cI think now it\u2019ll end up being more of a mainstay once it goes into effect, because I\u2019ll be able to get it a lot more regularly,\u201d said Chad Wells, executive chef at Alewife, a downtown restaurant. Wells predicted that prices, which have gyrated between $7 and $22 a pound, also should stabilize. State fisheries officials say they\u2019re not trying to hurt watermen. \u201cWhenever you have a major change like this \u2026 you have winners and losers,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Connell, state fisheries director. \u201cIt sorts itself out.\u201d Catch shares are catching on worldwide, covering 15 major fisheries in the United States. Advocates, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, say shares help eliminate overfishing, produce more fish at lower costs to consumers and improve fishermen\u2019s safety and profits. But individual quotas have drawn criticism from some commercial fishing organizations and even from some environmentalists, who argue that dividing up the catch can drive small fishermen out of business and harm traditional fishing communities. This is Maryland\u2019s first major venture into catch shares, though they\u2019ve been used in a few smaller fisheries. The stakes are high with rockfish. They are Maryland\u2019s third-most-valuable seafood after blue crabs and oysters, with a dockside value of nearly $6 million.Overfishing so depleted them in the 1980s, however, that the state imposed a five-year catch moratorium. With continuing concerns about their health and fishing pressure, they\u2019re tightly regulated. In recent years, said Michael Luisi, director of estuarine and marine finfish, the total allowable catch has shrunk by 25 percent, reducing the season at the end of the year to a couple of days a week for a couple of weeks in November and December. The final day for striped bass harvest this month was Dec. 18, when temperatures hovered around freezing and winds gusted to 25 miles per hour. Frigid, even snowy weather often proves best for catching the fish, said Donald C. Pierce, 65, a veteran fisherman from Rock Hall. He and his two helpers were on the water from 2 a.m. until 9 p.m. on the final day, he said, but they netted nearly 1,000 pounds. \u201cThis is not a 9-to-5 job,\u201d Pierce said, with no guarantee of catching the quota on any given day. \u201cThe fish hold the upper hand.\u201d State officials say they were prompted to end the derby tradition after the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, which regulates near-shore fishing, decreed that all striped bass caught for sale be individually tagged. State regulators concluded it would be an administrative nightmare to continue the on-again, off-again season for those who harvest the bulk of the state\u2019s striped bass, Luisi said. So, with a total of 1.9 million pounds of rockfish allowed to be caught for sale next year, state officials have divided the commercial harvest up among 1,100 fishermen. A third of the catch went to about 100 fishermen who use staked \u201cpound nets\u201d to catch their prey, while the rest was split among 958 fishermen who go after rockfish with gill nets or hook-and-line gear. The most active fishermen argued that the quotas should be based on past catch history, while those who hadn\u2019t fished much or at all argued that everyone should get an equal share. \u201cIt was like a world war,\u201d Luisi said of the state\u2019s contentious meetings with fishermen. State officials chose to give everyone at least some fish to catch. The smallest quota, for an unused permit, was 355 pounds, while the most active fisherman got roughly 14,000 pounds, Luisi said. To give fish to those who hadn\u2019t caught many before, the state reduced the quotas for its most successful fishermen. Luisi said no one was cut more than 30 percent from what they had reported catching. The state offered unhappy fishermen the chance to stick with the old system for one more year, though with an extremely limited share of the overall catch. About 100 opted for that, while nearly 840 signed up for individual quotas. Seventeen fishermen got neither, either because they failed to declare a preference, or because their fishing rights were suspended. (Pierce is among the latter category, having been cited for multiple fishing violations this year. He acknowledges fishing on a dead man\u2019s permit, saying he did it to help the man\u2019s widow out of financial difficulties.) Despite the state\u2019s attempt to address watermen\u2019s concerns, the new system shakes up a livelihood that\u2019s feeling increasingly squeezed by government regulations, shrinking populations of fish and rising costs for fuel and gear. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the end to the traditional fishery and the smaller fishermen on the bay,\u201d predicted Robert T. Brown Sr., president of the Maryland Watermen\u2019s Association. Not everyone agrees. Virginia and Potomac River officials have doled out catch shares for striped bass for years, and fishermen who\u2019ve worked under those systems say they like it, at least in concept. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a little bit harder on the individual \u2014 he\u2019ll have to do a little marketing himself,\u201d acknowledged Lee Wilson of Crisfield, president of the Chesapeake Bay Commercial Fisherman\u2019s Association, whose members mainly work in the lower bay. But in the end, he said, \u201cit gives you a lot more opportunity\u201d because fishermen can to try to time their catch for when prices are higher, instead of having to catch them all at once and have to sell them cheaply because the market is glutted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about openings and closings, you don\u2019t have to call an 800 number to find out if you can go to work,\u201d said Billy Rice, a Charles County waterman who\u2019s worked in Virginia and the Potomac. But Wilson and Rice aren\u2019t completely happy with Maryland\u2019s new approach. They wanted everyone to have an equal share. One relative newcomer, Stan Dabkowski, said he\u2019s been handcuffed with a catch share that\u2019s about a third of what he caught last year. The 59-year-old former farmer and businessman from Manchester said he started fishing commercially last year. After paying roughly $7,000 for a striped bass permit, he caught about 1,000 pounds of fish his first year, he said. His quota for 2014 is 355 pounds, the minimum, because the permit he bought had no long-term catch history. \u201cThey\u2019re just cutting the throats of those who want to get into the business,\u201d said Dabkowski. With the fishing license and permit fees costing $755 a year, he said, he\u2019ll only be able to clear about $300. State officials say they didn\u2019t count last year\u2019s landings in determining quotas because they feared fishermen would inflate their reports once they knew future quotas would be based on catch history. O\u2019Connell called Dabkowski\u2019s situation unfortunate, but pointed out that the state is encouraging fishermen to lease catch quotas from others who aren\u2019t able or willing to use theirs. It means having to pay thousands more to someone to take a chance on catching more fish. Still, some have posted buy and sell notices on a web listing set up by the department, while others reportedly have made offers directly. \u201cThe industry wanted more flexibility,\u201d O\u2019Connell said, and state officials believe using catch shares is the best way to provide that and meet the state\u2019s needs to tighten control over the harvest. While there may be some difficulties with making the transition, he predicted that the fishery would wind up roughly the same as it was, with a few hundred people catching the bulk of the rockfish. \u2014 The Baltimore Sun", "Title: Will a great year for Chesapeake Bay crabs mean a great year for watermen? Content: OFF HOOPERS ISLAND, Md. \u2014 At 4:41 a.m., Bubby Powley looked at his watch, looked at the thin, pink glow to the east, and looked at the dark water sliding past his boat. According to Maryland state law, he was allowed to start catching crabs exactly one hour before sunrise, and that was right . . . about . . . \u201cNow. Dontcha think, Monroe?\u201d Powley said, hitting a lever on a boom that lifted his first batch of the day from the Chesapeake Bay. The sprightly 66-year-old swung the basket inboard, where his culler of 42 years, Monroe Dorsey, 68, a slim cigar clenched under his white mustache, dumped a few dozen wriggling crustaceans into a fiberglass basin. It was a pretty good haul in what so far has been a very good crab harvest. Dorsey measured male after male with a plastic caliper and tossed those of five inches or more into one of the six and a half bushels Powley would sell later that day to a wholesaler. The summer is getting off to a promising start along America\u2019s biggest estuary \u2014 the center of a beleaguered, multibillion-dollar commercial fishery. Scientists are predicting a robust blue crab season, with an annual survey showing big numbers of crustaceans beginning their annual south-to-north march across the bay\u2019s floor. Fishermen report a marked improvement in water quality. And with every haul of his basket, Powley has to clear his rig of huge clumps of eelgrass, a vital marker of the ecosystem\u2019s health that had been missing for years. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too soon to go overboard and declare victory,\u201d said Bill Goldsborough of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, \u201cbut it\u2019s a positive sign.\u201d But out on the water an hour before dawn, it\u2019s hard for the Chesapeake\u2019s weathered and wary watermen to exult. After decades of declining catches, reams of new regulations and endless market fluctuations, those who still pull their living from the bay know that every silver lining has its cloud. \u201cWe\u2019ll know whether it\u2019s a good year in November [when the season ends],\u201d said Powley, who has been fishing off Hoopers Island in Dorchester County for more than 40 years, just as his father, grandfather and great-grandfather did. He has seen a season start out with the traps and trotlines brimming with crabs only to peter out in the doldrums of midsummer, as it did in 2012. Location can be key, as migrating crabs congregate in some nooks of the bay and leave others empty of commercial quantities. The best years, watermen say, are when the Chesapeake has a big harvest and other parts of the country don\u2019t. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got crabs this year, from New York right on down to Georgia,\u201d said John Buchanan, a lifelong fisherman who crabs on the Tred Avon River near Oxford, Md. Already, they can feel the pinch that bites harder than any crab claw: When the catch goes up, the price goes down. Full-timers are finding it easy to fill bushel after bushel. And part-timers, drawn by reports of easy pickings, are trailering in boats and leaving the wholesale docks groaning with crabs. At the beginning of June, Powley was making $100 for each bushel of No. 1 males. Within three days, the price fell to $80. A week after that, $70. \u201cAny waterman will tell you it\u2019s not what you catch, it\u2019s what you make,\u201d said Buchanan, who estimates that 90 percent of the boats he sees are part-time license-holders working weekends and vacations. The boat tied up two slips from his belongs to a Talbot County deputy sheriff. \u201cThey come in for the gravy and still have a job to fall back on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe full-timer waterman, though \u2014 that\u2019s getting less and less.\u201d The lean years have taken a toll on Chesapeake fishermen, according to Tom Horton, an environmental studies instructor at Salisbury University and a frequent chronicler of the bay\u2019s signature waterman culture. He estimates that their numbers have fallen from 10,000 or more in the 1990s to fewer than 3,000 who are active today. Overfishing of crabs, oysters and rockfish squeezed out many. And while the massive multi-state effort to restore those fisheries is showing signs of success, its restrictions \u2014 on the hours they can fish and the amounts they can land \u2014 have chased plenty of watermen to other jobs. \u201cThe people I know who still make a full-time living off the water are the ones who thank God every day they have a wife who is a nurse at the hospital,\u201d Horton said. Powley, whose own wife worked in the Dorchester County Clerk\u2019s Office for years, said he\u2019s grateful for the long career he has had on the back of the Maybe Baby, his 42-foot Chesapeake work boat. For four decades, he ran crab pots, the high-capacity wire cages that could produce 150 bushels a morning in the days before restrictions. Now semi-retired, he and Dorsey meet at the dock every morning at 3:30 and crab for nine hours \u2014 the maximum allowed by law \u2014 with three 2,500-foot trotlines, a piece of bait tied every six feet. \u201cIt gets in your blood,\u201d he said, a dark silhouette in a white bib as the sky grew rosy behind him. \u201cI still love watching the sun come up every morning.\u201d He tweaked the vertical tiller at the side of his boat as he steered along his middle trotline. In the water, the thin cord rose from the five-foot bottom. The crabs zipped by as pale blurs, clinging fatally to their hunk of chicken or cow lip until they were knocked into the basket. At the end of the line, Powley hoisted the basket, dumped it and steered for the buoy that marked the next run. Dorsey sorted the catch into Jimmies (males), sooks (females) and peelers (the molting \u201csoft-shell\u201d crabs they sell for 75 cents apiece). Those too small went back over the side. The big ones can deliver a nip even through his neoprene gloves. \u201cWhen you been at it as long as I have, you don\u2019t pay it no mind,\u201d he said, shaking another tenacious Jimmy from his finger. On July 15, when the size limit shifts by a quarter-inch, Dorsey will pull out the 5.25-inch caliper. In October, the workday will expand by an hour. It takes 26 clauses to detail the hours and dates governing legal crabbing through the season. \u201cIt\u2019s all so regulated, half the time the [Department of Natural Resources officers] don\u2019t know the rules \u2014 they have to call Annapolis,\u201d Powley said. There is a grudging acquiescence to the tight controls that watermen face in the modern age. They complain but comply, assuming that no one understands the bay more than those who spend their lives on it. Some occasionally credit \u201cmanagement\u201d with making things better. \u201cThe water is as clear as I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d said Nick Crook, a 29-year-old waterman who lives on Kent Island, Md. \u201cI think the pollution controls are having a positive effect.\u201d But generally, commercial fishermen attribute the ebb and flow of the animal populations they chase to natural cycles. They tend to dismiss the predictive power of the winter crab survey conducted by the state. Powley argues that the sea grass is back because of the power dredging for oysters they allow near Hoopers Island. When Dorsey finished his sorting, he would light another cigar and step across the boat to work on the next day\u2019s bait. Each case of beef lips has to be packed in salt to brine overnight. Every afternoon, he and Powley spend three more hours stripping the lines of old bait and tying on another 1,300 or so fresh chunks. A case of cow lips is $135, giving him two days of bait per line. Fourteen gallons of diesel runs about $35. In all, it cost Powley about $300 to pull away from the dock that morning, not counting insurance, his crab license and the $18,000 he recently spent to resurface the bottom of the Maybe Baby. After tying up, Powley sold his six bushels of big males, three bushels of culls (skinnier males destined for the picking house) **** and two dozen peelers for a take of about $650. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, and it seems like not as many people are willing to do it full-time,\u201d Powley said as he picked sodden clumps of grass from his net. That sea grass used to float in patches \u201cby the acre\u201d when Powley started out crabbing with his father. He\u2019s glad to see it back, even though it means more work cleaning his gear. The grass provides a critical nursing habitat for baby crabs, and its return is a sign of a recovering bay and, hopefully, a more stable fishery. Two new crab-processing plants have opened this season on the Eastern Shore, according to Bill Sieling of the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industries Association. And although watermen are making less per bushel of crabs, they are increasingly able to round out their year with other catches, including oysters in the fall and rockfish (striped bass), once banned from being fished in the bay. As Powley crabbed on the Honga River, his brother was texting him photos of the menhaden he was catching in the Patuxent River. Crook, the waterman who lives on Kent Island, is making such good money from a growing market in soft-shell clams that he has yet to bring out his crab pots. Each day, he dispatches up to 15 bushels of clams to a wholesaler in a refrigerated truck. They are in Boston by 6 a.m. and fetch $80 to $100 a bushel. \u201cIt\u2019s all a balancing act. You\u2019ve got to see what you can make the most money at,\u201d said Crook, whose father has already switched to crabbing. Still, however encouraging the future of fishing might be, Powley knows that crabs and clams are unreliable creatures. His own son did not become the family\u2019s fifth generation of watermen. Instead, he is president of a German-based filter manufacturer in Cambridge, Md. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be the last one,\u201d Powley said. \u201cI sent him to college.\u201d **Read more:** Traffic-weary homeowners and Waze are at war, again.

Relax and follow this guide. Content: I once knew a woman named Dot who lived in a seaside town and planted gardens for people. By the time she got around to her own, it was July 1, which some would call \u201ctoo late.\u201d Dot, who also dug clams, knew that \u201ctime and tide wait for no man,\u201d but, having no choice, she did in early July what she\u2019d hoped to do in March or April. Somehow she always wound up with a productive garden. Habitual gardeners rely on precise planning. But the guidelines we learn so carefully can seem more a belief system than an empirical science. \u201cThe last expected frost date,\u201d after which the planting of most food crops is safe, is no more of a signpost than a blaze on a tree that has fallen across a trail. Guesswork has always been a part of gardening and will remain so. Although forecasting temperature, rainfall and the like has gotten more sophisticated and perhaps more accurate, the weather itself has gotten more extreme and at times more \u201cunseasonable.\u201d As a response to a life of weather uncertainty, I\u2019ve become less attached to the idea of a gardening year, with well-defined seasons. So if you somehow never got around to spring planting, here are a few tips on how to go ahead and roll the dice. Tormenting yourself about the non-sowing of spring peas is less helpful than ordering seeds for a fall crop, \u201cfall\u201d being a vague stretch of time that might, theoretically, be marked by cool temperatures. And while you\u2019re planning for a garden that will perform from early September into November and beyond, there\u2019s still time to stock the summer garden. You can still sow beans, both pole and bush. In fact, any crop that you\u2019d normally plant in succession crops will do fine. An early summer crop of summer squash is often replaced by a late summer one after the plants have begun to sprawl. Just ignore the first and plant the second. It\u2019s not too late to focus on the glory vegetables of summer, such as tomatoes, peppers and eggplants. Check garden centers to see whether they have leftover seedlings, which might be half price. The tomatoes may be tall and floppy, with yellow flowers and even little green fruits. Plant them deeply, burying part of the stem and removing the lowest leaves. The great thing about tomatoes is that they form adventitious roots all along their stems, so overgrown seedlings, well watered, may still develop great root systems and bear lots of fruit. When they do, make a point of canning or freezing them. That\u2019s what Dot did in fall, when her outdoor work lessened and the kids were back in school. In fact, she was better known for her well-stocked winter larder than she was for blowing off spring. Greens such as lettuce and arugula, which wilt or bolt in hot weather, can be postponed until fall, though you might try a heat-tolerant lettuce such as Jericho or Nevada and see what happens. If you started greens and herbs in flats but never got around to preparing their beds, just make a salad of them and move on. Between July and September, you can sow a variety of cool- season vegetables, beginning with ones that take longer to produce, such as Brussels sprouts, potatoes, beets and carrots, and ending with quick greens such as mesclun mixes, arugula and Asian greens. By late summer, you can also add kale, collards and spinach \u2014 all of which (along with leeks) will join the sprouts in going well into winter. You might designate garden beds for these late crops, covering them with a mulch such as hay, a tarp or flattened cardboard boxes, to keep the beds from growing weeds. That will also protect the soil and soil creatures from the hot sun. Some day in December, when you reflect on the preceding months, you\u2019ll realize how many unexpected gifts you received from your garden. A sudden rainstorm in the night that quenched the soil\u2019s thirst and freed you from watering the next day. The tomato starts you got from a neighbor who grew too many. The edible weeds such as purslane, lamb\u2019s quarters and wild sorrel that appeared unbidden, when you had no other green leaves for a salad. Recently, the French have deemed their common word for weed inappropriate, knowing that even weeds can have value. Instead of mauvaise herbe, which translates to \u201cbad plant,\u201d some like to substitute the word adventice \u2014 a plant that simply takes advantage of a spot your garden offers. Sounds like a good name for the gardener as well. Check that ties, labels and supports on young trees have been removed or loosened to prevent bark constriction as the plants put on their spring growth spurt. Neglected wires can seriously compromise a tree\u2019s vascular system and long-term health. **\u2014 Adrian Higgins** **More fromLifestyle:** Down the garden path: A new show tracks America\u2019s love affair with plants Elevate your gardening skills (and save space) with climbing crops Is this popular gardening material bad for the planet? Planting flowers among fruits and veggies is tempting but tricky", "Title: Book World: \u2018Rosemary Verey\u2019 is an irresistible biography of a horticultural sage Content: People sometimes ask reviewers how they happen to choose the books they write about. In this case, the answer is easy: The picture on the cover of \u201cRosemary Verey: The Life and Lessons of a Legendary Gardener\u201d was so lushly, ravishingly gorgeous that I couldn\u2019t resist picking up the book. I subsequently learned that the Laburnum Walk at Barnsley was, according to its frequent photographer Jerry Harpur, perhaps \u201cthe most famous view of any garden anywhere in the world.\u201d Another reason I was drawn to this book is far more personal. I hoped that it would inspire me to become a more active gardener. Verey (1918-2001), as her biographer Barbara Paul Robinson says, \u201cmade beautiful gardens seem possible to the average homeowner. Her message was that you, too, could do this if you tried.\u201d Built in 1697, Barnsley House certainly looks grand, but its surrounding property amounts to less than four acres, though \u2014 as the color plates in this book reveal \u2014 every foot of its soil has been deployed for banks of flowers, graveled walks, horticultural ornaments (a fountain and sundial, statuary), formally precise plantings and even a potager (an elegant French term for a vegetable plot). Unfortunately, Robinson quickly convinced me that I might learn from Verey, but that I could never aspire to anything remotely like her gardens. She employed two full-time workmen, as well as regular interns and occasional casual labor (including, for a short time, Robinson). Most homeowners can devote, at best, a few hours a week or perhaps a Saturday afternoon to the maintenance of their lawns and flowers. Verey\u2019s designs \u2014 often geometrical and exceptionally tidy \u2014 were labor-intensive. Plants were dead-headed every morning, rotated in and out as the seasons changed, constantly paid attention to. It\u2019s little wonder that Verey\u2019s clients were nearly all well-to-do and often aristocratic \u2014 and, in some cases, even royal. Prince Charles, who became a friend, invited Verey to help with the gardens on his estate at Highgrove. King Hussein and Queen Noor also employed her talents, along with Elton John, some Kentucky horse-breeders and similar happy folk who aren\u2019t likely to be loading their Prius hatchback with bags of mulch from Home Depot. Robinson stresses that Verey wasn\u2019t an aristocrat herself, though her early life was certainly privileged: a childhood in the country centered on horseback riding, a madcap debutante season, early marriage to a dashing military officer who, after World War II, became a noted architectural historian, four children (all cared for by a nanny), a married life revolving around the local hunt, tennis matches and dinner parties, some possible love affairs and active involvement with the local church. Such was Verey\u2019s highly traditional, upper-class existence well into her middle years when she and her husband, David, began to develop the Barnsley estate. Throughout Robinson\u2019s biography, David is depicted as shy, courteous and impractical, more friend than spouse, alternately advancing and retarding the gradual blossoming of his wife\u2019s horticultural genius. In fact, David \u2014 author of the Gloucestershire volumes in Nikolaus Pevsner\u2019s \u201cBuildings of England\u201d and the founder of a local museum \u2014 comes across as a far more attractive human being than steely, perfectionist Rosemary. When he died in 1984, he left serious debts and thus gave his widow a stark financial reason to make the transition from gifted amateur gardener to full-time horticultural sage. Feisty Rosemary gradually grows on the reader. Her personal motto was \u201cit\u2019s a sin to be dull.\u201d She loved parties and hobnobbing with the rich and famous. Despite her English lady-of-the-manor persona, she smoked constantly and drank secretly, had her driver\u2019s license suspended for a year and flirted wildly with young men. After her husband\u2019s death, a friend declared that he was going to propose to her and that if she said no he would jump off a bridge. As the would-be suitor recalls, Robinson \u201c took off her spectacles, polished them, then looked at me with a gleam and said, \u2018Tell me which bridge!\u2019 \u201d In particular, though, Verey is an inspiration \u2014 not only to gardening enthusiasts but to all late bloomers. Her first book, \u201cThe Englishwoman\u2019s Garden,\u201d appeared only in 1980, (co-written with Alvilde Lees-Milne, wife of the notoriously scandalous diarist and architectural historian James Lees- Milne). Verey was then 62, and 18 books were to follow before her death in 2001, most notably \u201cThe Garden in Winter,\u201d \u201cThe Art of Planting\u201d and \u201cThe American Man\u2019s Garden.\u201d She proved to be a natural networker, welcomed by the owners of the estates she featured and praised in her books. She also possessed great energy and \u201cnever walked through any garden without a notebook in hand to jot down observations, plants, and ideas.\u201d One of her interns, Sue Spielberg, remembers her workday. After issuing her orders to the gardening staff, she would sit down at her desk to plan and write: \u201cShe had this oval table where she\u2019d do her work with a beautiful floral tablecloth hanging down. Lovely antiques everywhere and books and that smell. She\u2019d have fresh flowers in the house and go out and get a little posy of hellebores and have them floating in a big wide shallow dish and piles of books everywhere. You couldn\u2019t really sit down anywhere because there\u2019d be things she\u2019d have to deal with and piles of the things that she\u2019d have to read and piles of . . . reference books for her writing. It felt warm because she kept a log fire burning in there most of the time and it just had that smell and that look.\u201d \u201cAs with everything in life,\u201d Verey once declared, \u201csuccess lies in method.\u201d She loved symmetry, as represented in her \u201cknot garden\u201d \u2014 elaborately interlaced boxwood \u2014 yet her aim was always to create a landscape \u201cto satisfy our eyes and agitate our hearts.\u201d When designing a new garden, she explained, \u201cFirst, I make a general plan, showing paths, border shapes, prominent features, including any major tree-planting.\u201d Then, \u201cI simply make lists of plants for each area, because I really like to lay the plants out on the site.\u201d (In one early journal she wrote, probably in her trademark green ink: \u201cBe not tempted by plants that hate lime.\u201d) Her favorite colors were \u201csoft pinks, purples, and lavenders,\u201d and \u201ccolor, texture, and harmonious visuals were her signature.\u201d As she once told another gardener: \u201cWe don\u2019t do things because they\u2019re labor-saving or low-maintenance or because they\u2019re horticulturally correct. We do them because they\u2019re pretty.\u201d And very pretty, too, is this neatly designed book from the publisher David Godine. Robinson, a New York lawyer by day and a gardener by avocation, writes not just clearly but also affectionately about her beloved, influential and rather spiky subject. Sadly, after Verey\u2019s death, Barnsley was bought by the owners of a local pub who tried to turn it into a country hotel. Today, its famous gardens, along with many others Verey designed, have been significantly altered or allowed to decay. As Washingtonians well know, weeds never rest. Dirda reviews books for The Post every Thursday.", "Title: The impatient gardener Content: Seasoned gardeners will tell you that a newly planted garden can begin to look effective in three years, full in five and knitted together by seven. Give the shade trees a decade or two. But what if you wanted a near-instant garden because you are planning to retire to the Eastern Shore in a few years, or intend to sell your home in five, or you\u2019re just an impatient soul in need of instant gratification? As Arlington landscape designer Tom Mannion points out, commercial landscapers install finished exteriors all the time, using oversized trees and shrubs, lots of big evergreens for plant architecture, and beds that rely on seasonal annuals or mounding ground covers, all tied together with lots of mulch and push-button watering systems. The advantages: a neat and mature look with relatively low weekly maintenance. The drawbacks: a landscape that is expensive to put in, needs a seasonal maintenance regimen and has all the character of a hotel courtyard. For those who want a more personal garden, there are tricks that hasten effects without robbing the landscape of its heart. Here are some ideas that aren\u2019t necessarily cheap or without toil, but will richly reward your efforts in short order. Whether you want a speedy garden or a plodding one, every paradise needs a place that ties the house to the landscape, and where you can sit in comfort, shelter and privacy. It\u2019s called a patio. Patios should be dry, flat and shady in summer. Some form of paving will lift you out of the mud, but, as Mannion points out, if you have storm water that is compromising the house, you need to fix that before you do anything else. A wet area that doesn\u2019t bother the abode doesn\u2019t need expensive drain systems; you can use it to create a pretty garden of moisture-loving plants, including the common mallow, the swamp hibiscus, ostrich ferns, ironweed and butterbur. Gordon Hayward, a Vermont-based landscape designer, says a quick and effective floor for a patio might be something as simple as pea gravel, with framing to keep it in place, though it would quickly become littered under a tree. A step up in materials and price would be dry-laid brick or bluestone (each has more character than modular concrete pavers). Salvaged brick, in particular, can save costs and give an instant look of age. \u201cIf the house is contemporary, I like to use exposed aggregate concrete, edged in stone,\u201d Mannion says. Often, patio terraces need some form of retaining wall to achieve flatness, an investment that will be repaid when the house is sold. Alternatively, a low deck can provide a level patio floor without requiring masonry walls, Mannion says. Once you have a floor for the speedy garden, you need walls. Fences, trellises and arbors can provide an instant veil that a screen of trees or a hedge cannot. As Mannion points out, many people think that a fence is an ugly stockade or chain-link affair. \u201cI say, get a beautiful fence; they don\u2019t think such a thing exists,\u201d he says. Find a competent carpenter, show him or her structures you like, and go for cedar, if your budget allows. Tip: Use larger material than you had in mind; scale is different outdoors than inside. Also, you don\u2019t have to fence out your whole lot: You can put up a fence or trellis around just part of your patio. A trellis will lighten the wall effect and permit summer breezes. Local building codes limit fence heights, but an arbor or pergola can provide an elevated garden element that screens, shades and provides support for vines. Again, don\u2019t skimp on materials or size, not least because something like a climbing rose or kiwi vine needs a sturdy support. (See the next page.) Petunias have their place, but there are a host of other annuals that will give a quick \u201chit\u201d in this and future growing seasons. Sow sunflowers weekly in May and June for a successive bloom from late July to frost. Giant sunflower varieties such as Mammoth and Sunzilla provide their own near- instant screen, but the more delicate ones grow to five feet, are covered in smaller blooms and add a degree of elegance missing in the linebacker versions. May sowings of cosmos and cleome bring summer blooms; just sprinkle the seed in rich, cultivated beds and thin the seedlings when they are small. Surely one of the easiest and most rewarding annuals is the zinnia, especially the improved varieties that resist the late-season powdery mildew. In the fall, after clearing beds of fallen leaves, I sow extravagant amounts of seed of Shirley poppies, California poppies and larkspur. I could add bread poppies to the mix, but I find them rigid in comparison to the softer Shirley poppies. All these seeds germinate in late winter, grow rapidly in the warmth of spring and produce unexpectedly showy flowers in May and June. As a rule, well-grown perennials make a show in their second year and look well-established by their third. Perennials \u2014 including ornamental grasses \u2014 can look fussy and formless if planted without sufficient thought. This is avoided by massing them as bold clumps that speak to each other. A bulb (or tuber) contains a whole plant ready to go, so putting in bulbs guarantees a floral show just a few weeks after planting. The most common mistake is in not using enough. Six daffodils will barely register; 60 will create an effect; 600 will make a spring. If placed out of deep shade, daffodils will come back year after year. There are so many varieties that you can have a show from early March to late April, with sizes that fit their surroundings. Some tulips will come back year after year, particularly the delicate wild tulips, but the showier ones should be viewed as a spring extravagance and pulled after blooming. These and other spring bulbs bridge the gap between the start of spring and early May, when annuals and tropicals can be grown that will give an immediate season of dynamic growth and bloom. Summer bulbs offer their own immediate display, and dahlias are particularly useful in providing months of flowering if they are given rich soil and adequate moisture. The single and semidouble types with dark stems are easy to place with other plants. Dahlias must be lifted at the end of the year and stored indoors, but lilies can stay put, and they make great architectural summer plants. I like the big and fragrant Oriental-trumpet hybrids. In shade, use caladiums and calla lilies. Containers give instant form and height to a garden and accommodate a whole range of plants. There is no rule that says you can plant only geraniums and impatiens in containers, but avoid a mess of small pots and invest in larger containers. A large pot at least 14 inches in diameter makes a statement and is less stressful on plants than tighter quarters. Frost-proof pots can stay out all year (covered) but clay ones cannot. Hayward says buy or rent a ball cart, a large dolly designed for planting trees, to move heavy containers around. A woody plant in a container offers an unexpected delight: Gardenias, sago palms and citrus in a handsome pot give an exotic flair to the patio. Lavender and boxwood look good, too, but there is one plant that will set you apart as a sophisticate: The dwarf pomegranate has exquisite foliage and red blooms, and is tough enough to survive most Washington winters. Tropical plants love the Washington summers and grow with vigor here. Banana plants take about three years to reach full size \u2014 that is, 12 to 18 feet, depending on how pampered they are. They will reach six to eight feet in their first season. One of the most robust is the red Abyssinian banana, which has the added bonus of having striking plum-red veins. In the fall, cut it back and store the root ball indoors. The hardy banana, called basjoo, will survive a typical winter in the garden. Some gardeners cut the stems at waist height in November and pile in leaves for extra protection. Elephant ears or taros come in a number of sizes and colors, from striking black-leafed, white-veined varieties such as black velvet to enormous green- leafed taros. Given moisture and nutrients, the Thai giant has leaves that are more than five feet long. Cannas offer more big leaf drama. In shaded areas, you could use many varieties of coleus, a metallic purple plant named Persian shield or large specimens of house plants such as kentia palms and the peace lily. Another wonderful, speedy garden is the vegetable plot. Don\u2019t bother with this if it won\u2019t get at least six hours of full sunlight each day. Flat land is a plus, though beds can be terraced, and don\u2019t worry too much about poor soil: By building frames, you can add lots of organic matter, including cheap municipal leaf mold. Start with a plot measuring just over 20 feet in length and width; this will give you room to create six rectangular beds, each five by eight feet and surrounded by paths. Vegetable gardens can produce three overlapping seasons of harvest in a single year, making them the ultimate in hasty horticulture. The more structure you can give a vegetable garden, the less scruffy its nature. A low picket fence, a brick path and a trellis or two all elevate the plot into a fancier kitchen garden. Veggies or herbs in pots will increase the harvest and give visual accents to the garden. The garden can be delineated by a low hedge of quick-fruiting plants, such as red currants, blueberries or the more brambly raspberries and blackberries. Asparagus can make an effective, feathery hedge that will take about three years to fill in. Be creative, be industrious, but above all, be quick. **@adrian_higgins on Twitter **", "Title: Why the shade garden is so underrated \u2014 and how to create your own Content: Shade gathers from year to year in the garden like the wrinkles on your face, growing more pronounced with time. Small bushes develop into large shrubs, young patio trees shift from skinny to broad, newly planted trees rise to the rooftops and beyond. This is a direct consequence of our love of plants and is all good. Or as horticulturist Jenny Rose Carey puts it: \u201cI love planting little trees and watching them grow.\u201d She has done this over the past 20 years in her 4\u00bd -acre garden in the Philadelphia suburb of Ambler. \u201cAs you mature as a gardener, your trees grow along with you, and that\u2019s a nice thing.\u201d So why are so many people down on shade? First, because they can\u2019t grow roses or zinnias in the gloom, and for many people a garden must have floral color to count. This is a limited view of the garden, where leaf forms, textures and plant architecture provide much more satisfaction, if only subconsciously. Another argument is that you can\u2019t have a vegetable garden in the shade. This is true, and there is no way around that. Shade gets the blame when the homeowner wakes up to the fact that the garden is overgrown and dank. This is a product, typically, of folks planting screening trees \u2014 especially evergreens \u2014 that were always destined to outgrow their allotted space. But I\u2019m with Carey in her belief that the shade garden is not just all right, and not just an asset now that the heat is upon us, but is actually the best part of the garden. Why? Artfully planted and groomed, it is the most sheltered and cocooning place to be. The hallmark of the shade garden, she says, is its \u201cintimacy,\u201d which I take as its sense of privacy, of being placed in a serene environment away from the chaos of modern life. Carey, who is director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society\u2019s public garden and nursery, Meadowbrook Farm, has written a book addressing the practical aspects of making and keeping a shade garden. It has an appropriately upbeat title, \u201cGlorious Shade.\u201d \u201cI hear so much negative stuff from people about shade, and I\u2019m not a negative gardener. I\u2019m positive.\u201d After reading her book and visiting her garden (and developing my own shade garden over more than two decades), I wrote a synthesis of Carey\u2019s explorations and my own experiences. Shade occurs when sunlight is blocked \u2014 simple enough, except that shade is a moving target. The sun moves across the sky daily, and seasonally it shifts its duration, height and strength. (Pedants will point out it\u2019s the Earth moving.) In March, a tree offers scant shade; in June, it is a large, living parasol. In the space of five years, an area that is in baking sun can become shaded. This elusive nature of shade registered with Carey when she saw one of her daughters, as a 2-year-old, try to capture her uncooperative shadow. (Her three daughters are now grown, and one plans a wedding reception in the garden this year.) In hot climates, many plants do better with a little shade, relieved of the heat and stress of the sun\u2019s rays, but in areas of deep, unremitting shade, the range of plants that will be happy narrows dramatically, so it\u2019s important to gauge the nature of your shade. Carey deconstructs the catchall label of \u201cpartial shade\u201d into something more useful: Edge shade is found at the boundary of woodland and provides the best of both worlds. Plants such as redbuds, dogwoods and azaleas thrive in such places. Dappled shade is produced by trees with fine foliage or elevated canopies. Old tulip poplars and oaks are good examples of this. This is a heavenly place for all concerned \u2014 lots of light without the searing sunbeams. Bright shade is found in dark areas that get a lot of reflected light from bodies of water, light-colored walls and windows. Afternoon shade is found where the shading element is on the western side of things, morning shade when it\u2019s to the east. Although, any area in uninterrupted afternoon sunlight is generally considered to be a sun garden. The point is that you need to observe light and shade patterns in a given area at different times of day to gauge its shadiness. Turning a wooded lot into a sweet garden is not just a state of mind; it requires action. **Your plot:** Lots with trees tend to be neglected, and neglect leads to the arrival of heavy-duty weeds, particularly invasive vines such as porcelain berry, English ivy, honeysuckle and poison ivy. \u201cStart by chopping the top growth,\u201d Carey writes in her book, \u201cand then dig up the roots.\u201d Then comes the sterling advice: They may re-sprout; be vigilant. After you have cleared those (take the usual care with poison ivy), you may find that previous occupants used the woods as a dump. I spent weeks clearing my wooded areas of brush, rubble, rotting firewood and timbers. You may also want to take down volunteer trees, even non-weedy ones, that have simply produced a thicket. This will open up space and light and make the remaining plants happier. Because she has the room and loves wildlife, Carey has allowed a few dead trees to remain as high stumps, and keeps them for birds as long as the trunks are structurally sound. **Mulch:** Mulch retains soil moisture and discourages weeds. Woodlots make their own mulch \u2014 leaves \u2014 and as they decay, the leaves improve the soil structure and feed beneficial soil life. Fallen leaves are best shredded and then spread carefully on growing beds to avoid smothering plantings. For times when you don\u2019t have enough leaf mold to go around, Carey suggests gathering pine needles, if you have them. If you resort to importing bark or wood mulches, use finely shredded versions around smaller plants, and don\u2019t put down a layer of more than two inches. **Plants:** The best mulches are ground covers, which in turn form the basis of layered plant compositions. These strata include bulbs, perennials, spring ephemerals such as trilliums and Virginia bluebells, small-to-large shrubs, understory trees and, finally, the canopy trees that are providing the shade. These plantings peak at different times, but one highlight in Carey\u2019s garden is in mid-spring, where the fresh, bright growth of hostas answers that of the Japanese maples, amid a swirl of delicate pink-flowering dicentras, blue- flowering brunneras and the spotted foliage of the lungworts. (Her book offers plant lists for given conditions.) Planting in established woodland requires its own skill. You don\u2019t want to smother tree roots with soil or chew them up with digging equipment. The key is to install young plants \u2014 perennials as plugs, for example \u2014 in the crevices between the tree roots. Carey likes to make a mixture of sand and leaf mold and, if there is room, work it into the planting hole. Small bulbs work well in the tight spaces between tree roots, including such March and April bloomers as chionodoxa, scilla and _Iris reticulata_. **Watering:** Carey dislikes irrigation systems, and not just because her Victorian property \u2014 Northview \u2014 is on a well. Irrigation systems can keep soil too wet and lead to the decline of many woodland plants, including big trees. Moreover, frequent shallow waterings encourage surface root systems that compromise plant resilience. She prefers occasional deep waterings to encourage roots to grow downward. For new plants, she gives them a good drink once a week in their first growing season but is more stinting the next year. **Paths:** Walking paths are vital elements in shade gardens; they keep feet from compacting plant roots and can fix problems with erosion. A layer of wood chips, replenished every year or so as it breaks down, will work in more naturalistic areas. But paths go way beyond utility; they establish the direction and character of the journey, which leads to the next point. A shade garden needs all the design elements of the larger garden. It may need more so that it \u201creads\u201d as a purposeful landscape. Consider how you might create all the important design features that make a garden beautiful and satisfying: portals, areas of transition from one space to another, focal points, framed views and, importantly, places to linger. The last category is well served in Carey\u2019s garden, which is full of spaces of repose, many of them infused with whimsy. This, in turn, is connected to Carey\u2019s cultural DNA \u2014 she moved to the United States from her native England 30 years ago. English gardeners are not just notoriously passionate about horticulture but also eccentric with it. This has produced such features as a children\u2019s fairy garden whose central water feature is a spouting copper teapot, and the stumpery. A popular Victorian idea, this is a display of tree stumps and roots presented as a form of grotesque sculpture. You either like it or you don\u2019t. One famous example is at Prince Charles\u2019s garden at Highgrove. Carey says the exposed roots are useful to educate visitors about the hidden architecture of trees. Every good peregrination through a new garden deserves a memorable ending, and Carey presents the ne plus ultra of payoffs, a splendiferous garden shed she calls Rose Cottage. There is something inexplicably English about the role of the shed in the garden; like the shade garden itself, it is a blend of utility, artistic expression and cozy retreat. Carey\u2019s is even more, functioning as the bridge of her ship from which she steers the maintenance and upkeep of her garden. On one wall, clay pots are stacked neatly. On another, garden tools are hung reverentially. Around a broad desk behind a bank of windows, she keeps plant records and catalogues. Above the windows, collected seeds are stored in decorative jars. She can tell you that she has 368 native trees and shrubs, and what blooms when. With her gardener Hanna von Schlegell, she has cultivated a garden that is in flower every day of the year, though not all in shade. Carey has an extensive collection of winter-flowering witch hazels. \u201cI like collections. A lot of British gardeners like collections,\u201d she said. \u201cI go a bit crazy on the snowdrops as well.\u201d And yes, snowdrops like to grow and spread in the shade, timing things so they appear at the shade garden\u2019s brightest time, when the leaves are off the trees. Now, in the blazing heat, the snowdrops have retreated into the soil, and it\u2019s the gardener who plants herself in the embracing darkness. **@adrian_higgins on Twitter ** **More fromLifestyle:** Missed the boat on spring gardening?

To grow delicious cucumbers, learn how they reproduce", "Title: In this garden, fall is a time to flourish, not fade Content: If you want some pointers on how to keep the garden humming along in a dry autumn, you should make your way to Wave Hill, the 28-acre estate overlooking the Hudson River in New York. Long known as a gardener\u2019s garden because of its high level of horticulture, it\u2019s a quiet and unexpected oasis in the Bronx whose stone mansion has been home to such creative souls as Mark Twain and Arturo Toscanini. New Yorkers know it as a place to spend a quiet hour sitting on the lawn, gazing beyond its arbor to the river and the stone cliffs of the Palisades on the Jersey side. I always seem to show up at Wave Hill late in the season, which is great because I get to see how others dress the garden for the final act. Two gardens here in particular focus on September and October but \u2014 instructively \u2014 in markedly different ways. The first is splashier. The Flower Garden sits alongside the ornate conservatory, where paths, fences and arbors form a framework for a loose and cheerful display of flower power. In general, the garden in early fall relies less on blooms than the late- spring version, drawing instead on the power of ornamental grasses and the shapes and textures of foliage plants. But even at this reduced pitch, the Flower Garden is awash in blossoms \u2014 salvias, helianthemums, dahlias, amaranth, nicotianas. If this is soon to crash with the first frost, neither the flowers nor the bees seem to know or care. This garden peaks in June and again in early fall. As such things as spent foxgloves and other biennials are yanked out after the first show, the holes are filled with plants destined to perform three months later. \u201cThe garden consists of about 40 percent perennials, 20 percent self-sowers, and the rest are things we grow and add,\u201d said Harnek Singh, the gardener. The beds radiate from a central circle, arranged by color. For the end-of-season show, Singh employs a few tricks. One is to delay starting dahlia tubers until late spring \u2014 a month or more later than usual. Those planted in May, he argues, have run out of steam by now. One of his dahlias, the crimson-flowered Bednall Beauty, should be grown for its foliage alone: Dark, cutleaf and small, it presents a dahlia with uncommonly fine texture. Another tactic is to start annuals later as well. \u201cI was still sowing seed at the end of June,\u201d he said. Candidates for such tardiness include cosmos, zinnias and, notably here, nicotiana and amaranth. The deep-plum-red nicotiana Nicki Red is gorgeous and became another name jotted in the notebook. With its dark-red foliage and tresses of crimson flowers, the amaranth is an annual full of Victorian melodrama \u2014 no wonder it\u2019s sometimes called Love Lies Bleeding. I find amaranth to be an acquired taste. Fortunately, I have acquired it. One plant was held in the arms of a rose bush, itself full of orange-red fruit, and together they resembled star-crossed lovers at the end of a bleak opera. Most amaranth flowers are red, but some are a tan brown, conspicuously a group of towering plants in the central bed named Hot Biscuits. It is hard to grasp that a plant so beefy started life just a few weeks earlier from a seed that would fit on a pinhead. One of Singh\u2019s beds is full of the basil-like \u2014 but purple-leafed \u2014 perilla, an annual he pinches back regularly in summer to delay flowering and keep its principal ornament, the foliage, looking fresh. Another foolproof way to enliven the fall garden is to plant lots of salvias. They are tender plants, and the largest of them function by August as shrubs with presence. Others are more slender and can be squeezed into places where there otherwise would be seasonal gaps. Singh has planted 42 varieties in the Flower Garden and points out a large, magenta-flowered beauty named Mulberry Jam, growing at the base of an aster that is yet to bloom. My own Mexican bush sage began to flower only last week. Other species start earlier but carry on through to the first frost. The second special autumn display occurs in the Wild Garden, which is a hillside with topography, gravel paths and plantings that scream more \u201cdry\u201d than \u201cwild.\u201d I love such arid landscapes because you can assemble so many interesting plants that otherwise struggle or rot away. The key, apart from a sunny aspect, is to make sure that the soil is as free-draining as it looks and that you are fastidious with your plant selection. Spring bulbs love these environments, by the way, and such a garden would be a haven for snowdrops, irises, crocuses, miniature daffodils and species tulips. Much of the garden is now a composition of forms and textures of perennials and small shrubs that are given spice through a series of self-sowing annuals. The gardener, Gelene Scarborough, has the real fun of pulling these annuals from unwanted areas, to leave others to emerge in just the right places, in the nooks and crannies between permanent plants. Because these annuals have chosen their sites themselves, the effect is natural, if not quite wild. Gomphrena, here the richly hued variety QIS Carmine, is a delightful presence in this environment. Scarborough has grown it in and around the dainty thistle-like blossoms of the tassel flower, _Emilia coccinea_. Other self- sowing annuals include the sculptural and wiry _Verbena bonariensis_ and the phlox-like _Silene armeria_. They are joined by clumps of garlic chives, which are handsome in their September white flowers, though a challenge to keep in check. Scarborough took me to the heights of the garden, where a couple more unusual self-sown annuals had created a real presence. _ _ Euphorbia cyathophora __is low and wide, with holly-like leaves, red flower bracts and clear echoes of its relative, the poinsettia. Its common name is fire-on-the-mountain. Fittingly, its cousin,Euphorbia marginata, grows nearby and is called snow-on- the-mountain. It is tall and slender, with creamy variegated leaves and white blossoms. It lends a cool freshness to the garden when it is most needed, at the end of a hot summer that managed to be both humid and in want of rain at the same time. ** _@adrian_higgins_ on Twitter**"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "The passage discusses the biography of a legendary gardener, Rosemary Verey, and her influence on gardening.

On one hand, the devices are far less dangerous than conventional cigarettes. It would be a public-health victory if every smoker stopped lighting up and chose to vape instead. On the other hand, e-cigarettes seem designed to appeal to children and teenagers. E-cigarette liquids come in a variety of candylike flavors that, according to federal health officials, have driven interest among young users. Some young people \u2014 it is unclear how many \u2014 would not have gotten hooked on nicotine without e-cigarettes. As youth e-cigarette use jumped \u2014 900 percent between 2011 and 2015, according to federal officials \u2014 the federal government hardly reacted. Astonishingly, there has been no ban on selling e-cigarettes and vaping liquids to minors, let alone consistent regulations on packaging, labeling and advertising or professional review of the ingredients that vaping companies put in their products. Though these products doubtless are less harmful than conventional cigarettes, they certainly contain nicotine, which may harm adolescent brains, and they might contain other chemicals that pose health dangers. The risks associated with inhaling secondhand vapor are also unknown. This regulatory vacuum has been unnecessary. Under the Tobacco Control Act, the Food and Drug Administration has wide-ranging power to regulate tobacco products. The agency finally has decided to begin using it more fully, announcing a final rule on e-cigarettes, cigars and hookahs. The rule bans e-cigarette sales to minors and requires sellers to check buyers\u2019 ages but stops short of cracking down as hard as the FDA could, by banning certain flavorings, for example. The most controversial part of the rule requires e-cigarette and e-liquid makers to submit their products to extensive FDA review before sale, providing ingredient lists and any data they have on health effects. Critics castigated the agency for cracking down on a young industry filled with small operators. The result, they say, will be more expensive and less desirable e-cigarette products, which will drive up conventional smoking and reward big tobacco companies that can afford to navigate the FDA process. This view neglects the danger that e-cigarette use will become increasingly common among youths, who without regulation would assume the products were safe, addicting a generation of children and teens to nicotine. E-cigarette businesses, whether small or large, are mixing highly addictive batches of chemicals and selling them with almost no federal oversight. Figuring out what is in these products is necessary for figuring out how dangerous they are \u2014 and how to make safer nicotine delivery devices for those trying to quit conventional smoking. The FDA\u2019s e-cigarette rules do not overreach. They are long overdue. **Read more on this topic:** The Post\u2019s View: How to regulate e-cigarettes Jonathan Adler: Why the FDA\u2019s new e-cigarette regulations are a gift to Big Tobacco", "Title: FDA outlines plan to regulate e-cigarettes Content: The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that it intends for the first time regulate the booming market of electronic cigarettes, as well as an array of other products such as cigars, pipe tobacco and hookahs. The move would begin to place restrictions on e-cigarettes, a nearly $2 billion industry that for years has operated outside the reach of federal regulators. If adopted, the government\u2019s plan would force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, stop handing out free samples, place health warning labels on their products and disclose the ingredients. Makers of e-cigarettes also would be banned from making health-related claims without scientific evidence. The FDA\u2019s proposal stops short of broader restrictions sought by many\u00ad \u00adtobacco-control advocates. Regulators at this point are not seeking to halt online sales of e-cigarettes, curb television advertising, or ban the use of flavorings such as watermelon, grape soda and pi\u00f1a colada \u2014 all tactics that critics say are aimed at attracting young smokers and that have been banned for traditional cigarettes. Those restrictions might come eventually, FDA officials said, but not before more rigorous research can establish a scientific basis for tougher rules. \u201cRight now, for something like e-cigarettes, there are far more questions than answers,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. He said Thursday\u2019s action is about expanding FDA\u2019s authority to products that have been \u201crapidly evolving with no regulation whatsoever,\u201d in order to create a foundation for broader regulation in the future, adding, \u201cIt creates the framework. We\u2019re calling this the first step. . . . For the first time, there will be a science-based, independent regulatory agency playing a vital gate- keeping function.\u201d E-cigarettes vary from brand to brand, but they generally resemble the size and shape of traditional cigarettes. Instead of burning tobacco, the battery-powered devices heat up flavored, nicotine-laced liquid, turning it into a vapor that the user inhales, or \u201cvapes.\u201d Supporters say that makes e-cigarettes an attractive alternative to their \u00adcancer-causing tobacco counterparts. Congress passed a law in 2009 giving the FDA broad power to regulate cigarettes, including requirements for new warning labels, restrictions on ads and explicit approval of new products. The law also gave the FDA the authority to broaden its jurisdiction over other tobacco-related products. While the agency has indicated for years that it planned to do just that, action has been slow in coming. Reactions to Thursday\u2019s announcement from the e-cigarette industry, public health officials and consumer advocates was swift \u2014 and mixed. Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the FDA\u2019s action an important step but said that it is \u201cinexcusable\u201d that the agency had taken so long to act. \u201cIn the absence of any meaningful regulation, the e-cigarette manufacturers have acted as if it\u2019s the wild, wild West, with no rules and no restraints,\u201d Myers said. \u201cTheir advertising is exactly the same type of advertising that made cigarettes so appealing to young people\u201d decades ago. He said FDA needs to move quickly to finalize Thursday\u2019s proposal and conduct the scientific research it will need to put more stringent rules in place down the road on marketing practices and flavors. \u201cThey can\u2019t move forward at the same pace that they have been moving and do their job protecting public health,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe can\u2019t waste another five years; this cannot take that long. There is a moral and public health imperative for them to treat this with the urgency it deserves.\u201d Still, whatever changes are coming won\u2019t happen overnight. The public will have 75 days to comment on the proposal. After the FDA sorts through a likely tidal wave of responses and finalizes its regulations, companies will have to begin complying almost immediately with the proposed age and identification restrictions. But they will have two years to submit applications to the FDA to approve their products, which can remain on the market in the meantime. The FDA\u2019s effort to begin overseeing the sprawling e-cigarette market comes at a critical time. Sales have doubled year after year, with no signs of slowing, according to some industry analysts. That pales in comparison with the estimated $80 billion-a-year U.S. market for conventional tobacco products, but the gap is shrinking steadily. In addition, tobacco giants such as Lorillard, Reynolds and Altria have entered the \u00ade-cigarette market in recent years, joining hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Some industry advocates worried Thursday that federal regulation will benefit only a handful of those large companies, who have established distribution channels and the money and manpower needed to file the streams of paperwork that will now be required to seek FDA approval of all e-cigarette products. \u201cThis is worse than I expected,\u201d said Greg Conley, a board member of the American Vaping Association, who said he welcomed the age-restriction rules but had hoped the FDA would grandfather in existing products, rather than force e-cigarette makers to file lengthy applications for any product on the market dating to early 2007. \u201cA lot of these companies, they are supporting several employees, investing any profits back into their buisness ... They can\u2019t afford this, and it\u2019s going to lead to a whole lot of consolidation and increased prices for consumers.\u201d Not everyone in the e-cigarette industry bristled at Thursday's proposal. Indeed, some of the larger players in the e-cigarette market praised FDA for committing to a science-based regulatory process, which they hope will allow them to make a strong case that e-cigarettes have the potential to reduce tobacco-related harm and be an overall positive for public health. \u201cWhat they did today was very encouraging ... We\u2019ve already done many things to prepare ourselves and act responsibly,\u201d said Miguel Martin, president of Logic Technology Development one of the nation\u2019s leading e-cigarette companies. \u201cAt least speaking for my company, this will not be the tobacco wars of the 80s and 90s.\u201d The move toward federal regulation comes amid an impassioned debate over simple questions that so far have no simple answer: Will e-cigarettes eventually cause more people or fewer to smoke? Will the devices emerge as a healthier alternative that makes cigarettes obsolete, or will they act as a gateway to smoking and undermine a half-century of efforts to reduce tobacco-related deaths, which still kill an estimated 480,000 Americans annually? \u201cThere\u2019s such a huge debate over whether e-cigarettes are a good thing or a bad thing for public health,\u201d said Kenneth Warner, a tobacco researcher and professor of public health at the University of Michigan. \u201cBut we\u2019re in a kind of factual vacuum. There are not that many [reliable] studies. . . . We really don\u2019t know the right answer.\u201d Warner said the FDA will have to walk a fine line in the way it treats e-cigarettes. On one hand, the agency must set reasonable \u00adrestrictions, such as keeping \u00adnicotine-delivery devices out of the hands of minors and creating safe manufacturing standards. On the other hand, if e-cigarettes do hold the potential to help some people quit smoking, the agency doesn\u2019t want to stymie innovation and crush an industry that\u2019s quickly evolving. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky balance,\u201d Warner said. \u201cEven in an environment devoid of politics and lawsuits, it would be a challenge to come up with the right mix of regulations. . . . Figuring out how to do this is going to be hard, and it isn\u2019t going to happen quickly.\u201d The cigar and e-cigarette industries have long been preparing for the inevitability of federal regulation \u2014 and working hard to try to shape it. For example, makers of \u201cpremium cigars\u201d have been lobby\u00ading intensely not to be lumped in with the fruit-flavored corner-store varieties that public health experts say target kids \u2014 a distinction FDA officials have said they are willing to consider. E-cigarette executives have been every bit as aggressive, making their case over the past year in meetings with FDA regulators, members of Congress, and state and local officials, seeking to avoid some of the stringent rules that govern conventional cigarettes. In essence, they have argued that \u00ade-cigarettes vapor is far less harmful than cigarette smoke, with its cancer- causing toxins, and can actually help smokers kick the habit. Therefore, the manufacturers say, they should be subject to kinder, gentler oversight \u2014 and lower taxes \u2014 than traditional cigarettes. At the same time, manufacturers have been fighting growing regulation in cities and states. Numerous cities, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Boston, have banned e-cigarettes in public places, and dozens of state attorneys general have urged federal regulators to speed up restrictions on marketing the devices to young people. The e-cigarette industry also has faced questions about the safety and accessibility of its products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this month that calls to poison centers involving e-cigarettes have surged in recent years as the products have gained in popularity, with most of the incidents involving children younger than 6 who have accidentally ingested the liquid nicotine. Last year, the CDC reported a dramatic increase in the number of high school students who said they had tried e-cigarettes, including some who had never smoked. That fueled concerns among some public health officials that the devices could lead users toward traditional smoking. E-cigarette advocates argue there\u2019s little evidence to support such a claim. According to the FDA, hard evidence will be key from now on. People on every side of the argument agreed that reliable research should dictate how the FDA regulates e-cigarettes going forward, even as what that research will show remains a source of disagreement. \u201cIt will move from theory and conjecture and gut feelings to a science-based regulatory framework,\u201d said Jason Healy, founder and president of blu eCigs, which was acquired by Lorillard in 2012. \u201cBoth sides have to now be accountable for their statements. You\u2019re going to have to put science behind it.\u201d However that ends up shaping the industry, Healy said, that approach ultimately could prove positive for consumers. \u201cThere\u2019s been so much uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, everyone will know where we stand.\u201d More from The Washington Post: Seven things about e-cigarettes Consider this before you \u2018vape\u2019 Big Tobacco tries to hook a new generation The Post\u2019s View: E-cigarettes have risks but offer benefits", "Title: Tobacco is still America\u2019s top health threat.

Content: _Kenneth Warner is the Avedis Donabedian Distinguished University Professor of Public Health at the University of Michigan._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday _One of the nation\u2019s leading researchers on tobacco concerns, he served as Senior Scientific Editor of the 25th anniversary Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, published in 1989. He chairs the board of the international journal Tobacco Control, and was a founding member of the board of directors of the American Legacy Foundation. From 2001-2002 he served as the World Bank's representative to negotiations on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. He is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday _I caught up with Warner last week for a conversation about the current challenge of tobacco control, and why the American public seems bored and jaded about our single largest public health problem._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Harold Pollack: When did cigarettes really become a public health concern?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Kenneth Warner: Cigarette smoking itself got going in a big way during World War I. The industry had recently perfected cigarette mass production. Manufacturers provided cigarettes for free for the dough boys, and that got it all going. The health problems probably began in a big way ten-to-thirty years later. There's actually a famous anecdote about a prominent surgeon named Alton Ochsner. When he was a medical student in 1919, he was called in to observe a lung cancer surgery. He was told at the time he might never see another case of lung cancer, it was so rare. He actually didn\u2019t for another seventeen years. Then he started seeing bunches--among men who had begun smoking during the war. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Public awareness of these problems probably dates back to the 1930s, although the linkages between tobacco and health were not rigorously documented until later. The earliest careful documentation began to appear around 1950. The first really solid epidemiological research was published in JAMA in 1950 by Wynder and Graham. It was a case-control study of 684 lung cancer cases. Wynder and Graham found that 96.5% of the lung cancer patients had been moderate or heavy smokers\u2014a much higher proportion than found among patients hospitalized for other things. It was the first really strong statistical evidence that smoking was associated with lung cancer. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Within a couple of years, the Doll and Hill cohort studies of British physicians concluded that smoking was strongly related to lung cancer. There was an American cohort study, a lot going on at the same time. From then on, it was clear that smoking caused many health problems. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: It\u2019s remarkable how much credible evidence emerged so quickly from so many sources and populations. It\u2019s useful to remember that history when listening to the latest dramatic claim that wheat germ causes cancer or whatever.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: That\u2019s right. Smoking was considered a risk factor by a lot of people for decades before the formal evidence was in. Cigarettes were often semi-jokingly referred to as \u201ccoffin nails\u201d decades before the real evidence started to come in. One of the great successes of the tobacco industry was to defuse the issue, to make people think it might be a minor problem, not as big as the experts said. Many people felt that smoking couldn\u2019t be as bad as the government said it was. After all, the government hadn\u2019t banned it. The mass public reaction to this research dates back to December 1952, and the publication of an incredibly influential article by Ray Norr, \u201cCancer by the Carton,\u201d in _Reader\u2019s Digest_. When you look at a curve of adult per capita cigarette consumption in the U.S., you see it going up steadily and then it drops sharply in 1953 and 1954 immediately following Norr\u2019s piece. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Back in those pre-TV days, _Reader's Digest_ was the American public's principal source of information about health and medicine. So the piece had an enormous impact. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Then cigarette companies started advertising filtered cigarettes as taking out the bad stuff that caused the problems and letting the flavor through. The public bought into these arguments because they wanted to buy the product. ** _The 1964 Surgeon General\u2019s Report on Smoking and Health_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: We just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Surgeon General's report on smoking and health. Why was that 1964 report such a big deal and how many lives were saved by the tobacco control efforts that that report kicked into motion?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: That Surgeon General's report was truly one of the great documents in the history of public health. It\u2019s recognized as such by pretty much everybody. They decided to issue the report on a Saturday because they were afraid of the effects it would have on the stock market. It was actually released to the press in a secured State Department conference room where President Kennedy had given his press conferences. The reporters were allowed in the room and given the report for 45 minutes beforehand. They were locked in. They had no telephones. They were not allowed to contact anybody. Then they had the press conference. The news about the Surgeon General's report was actually one of the lead news stories of all of 1964. Unfortunately, President Kennedy wasn't around for the release of the report that he had authorized. **Pollack: How did that report come about?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: It came into being because there were several health organizations urging President Kennedy to appoint a panel to study the evidence on smoking. They were frustrated because the previous Surgeon General, Leroy Burney, had issued a 1957 statement that smoking was expected to be the cause of lung cancer and other diseases and that this needed to be attended to. Nothing was happening. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The health organizations badgered President Kennedy and he did what any good president would do: He set up a committee, figuring basically that nothing would come of this, at least that's the rumor that he didn't think much would come of it in particular. The committee consisted of physicians and scientists who were vetted by the major health organizations and the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry could veto any of the people it didn't like. The committee ended up with a group, none of whom had specifically researched tobacco, none of whom had taken a public position on smoking, and several of whom were themselves smokers. It really was a very fair group. They spent 2 years in their study. Looked at over 7000 documents, which was the extent of the available literature at that time, and then came out with this report that really was a wallop to the American public and indeed to the tobacco industry. The committee said that smoking was the cause of lung cancer in men. There was not sufficient data about women in those days, though the committee suspected a link for women, too. They also associated smoking with a number of other diseases, and said that it was causally related to some of them. They came up with the off-quoted statement that \u201ccigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action.\u201d They didn't say what the remedial action was. That had to follow from whatever government and the private sector decided to make of it. ** _Eight million lives, 157 million life-years saved_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: It's been 50 years now. How many lives have been saved by the various measures we've done to try to reduce smoking?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: First, I think it's important to say what we mean by the term tobacco control. I'm using it to cover all of the efforts of the private, voluntary, and public sectors to reduce the toll of smoking: trying to prevent kids from starting to smoke, helping smokers to quit, avoiding exposure to second-hand smoke, all of that combined. This January, some colleagues and I published a paper in JAMA that estimated the cumulative health effects of tobacco control. We found that between 1964 and 2012, _eight million_ premature deaths were avoided as a result of tobacco control. We did not include second-hand smoke deaths, nor the years 2013 and 2014, so probably the best figure today would be about 10 million premature deaths avoided. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Tobacco control, broadly construed, accounts for fully 30 percent of the gain in adult life expectancy since 1964. Nothing\u2014no medical intervention or any other public health development - has contributed anything close to that.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Moreover, each of those deaths on average involved an increase in life of _20 years_. Most people have heard that smoking reduces life expectancy by something on the order of eight to ten years. That figure applies to all smokers including those who die of something else. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday It\u2019s amazing the death toll isn't higher. The typical pack-a-day smoker takes 10 to 12 sucks per cigarette, on twenty cigarettes a day. We need to call a spade a spade: smokers don\u2019t \u201cpuff\u201d on cigarettes \u2013 blowing out \u2013 they suck on them. Over the course of a year, they're smoking more than 7,000 cigarettes. The average lifetime smoker smokes for about fifty years. These men and women are consuming more than _300,000 cigarettes_ over their lifetimes. They are inhaling 7000 chemicals more than _3 million_ times, include seventy known human carcinogens. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday It\u2019s rather surprising that about half of smokers survive that 50-year chemical assault on their bodies. Even within this group, however, many are suffering from smoking-produced diseases like emphysema and heart disease, and many of them are chained to oxygen tanks, can't walk up stairs, or whatever. It's all pretty devastating. Over the same period that those 10 million lives were saved, about 20 million lives were lost to tobacco. It's astonishing to think of a death toll like that for something that we just don't seem to take as seriously as we ought to. ** _Tobacco control: The current challenge_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: We still have an estimated 480,000 people a year who are dying in America from tobacco-related causes. And it does seem to me that we don't hear quite as much about that as we did 10 or 20 years ago and people seemed a little bored and jaded with the topic. At least that's my perception. Do you think that's accurate?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: Definitely. The public\u2019s attention span is only so long. And for the public and policymakers to care about an issue, it seems to have to have genuine personal salience for them. Too many among the voting public, and certainly the nation\u2019s legislators, the smoking problem has been \u201csolved.\u201d Smoking is prohibited in most public places and workplaces. Those people don\u2019t smoke. Their friends don\u2019t smoke. They don\u2019t see it. The most influential segments of the voting public seem blissfully ignorant of the magnitude of the problem. ** _To give one example, if you ask women \u2013 educated women \u2013 what the leading cause of cancer death among women in the US is, the vast majority will answer breast cancer. Very few are aware that lung cancer now kills 72% more women than does breast cancer._** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The pink ribbon campaign for breast cancer has greatly raised awareness and funding for breast cancer research. That came about in no small part because there were so many articulate, educated women who were getting breast cancer and wanted to see something done about it. The male-dominated research establishment wasn't paying adequate attention. So there was a need for action. They've done a marvelous job with the pink ribbon campaign. But where\u2019s the brown ribbon campaign for the much larger group of women who are dying of lung cancer? I fear the answer is that they are the wrong people. They're less visible, less vocal, less organized. They are, in many instances, embarrassed that they're smoking and feel that they are personally responsible for having caused their disease. Somehow society is neglecting this disease. The deaths of one out of five Americans are produced by smoking. This is a shocking number. One out of every five deaths of Americans is caused by smoking today. Think about that: Fully a fifth of all deaths are completely avoidable! And yet the American public seems bored and passive about this. It\u2019s amazing, and tragic. Smoking today is concentrated in people with low educations and incomes. Increasingly, and frighteningly, smoking is also concentrated among people who suffer from some mental health concern. Some forty-to-fifty percent of all current smokers experience some comorbid mental illness ranging from anxiety to schizophrenia to substance use disorders. Nobody thinks about this when they talk about smoking, but right now, and increasingly over the years, smoking is becoming a problem associated with people who have mental health concerns. **Pollack: Just to clarify, that\u2019s not just people with severe mental illness, necessarily. You mean people with some other sort of mental health concern.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: Exactly. Anything from anxiety or manageable depression up to severe mental illness. Smoking rates are very high among individuals with schizophrenia: about 60% compared to 18% overall in the population\u2026. These men and women have a harder time quitting than do people who are not experiencing mental health problems. This doesn\u2019t mean they can't quit--because they can--but they have a harder time. For years, the approach to people with mental health problems--especially those who were hospitalized--was that you shouldn\u2019t to touch smoking: Deal with their most severe immediate mental health problem. You would exacerbate it if you tried to get them to quit smoking. It turns out that's not true. Often you're better off trying to help people in those situations to quit smoking while they're being treated for other mental health conditions. People with serious mental illness experience a loss of life expectancy of about 25 years, which is an extraordinary number. Smoking is responsible for a very large part of that. We need to address this group much better than we have to date. ** _The stigma of smoking_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: The stigma associated with smoking (and the marginalization of smokers as a political constituency) makes it easier to enact painful measures such as increased tobacco taxes. It opens possibilities to save lives through measures that would have been politically impossible thirty years ago. On the other hand it leads us to neglect many people who are smokers and to disparage many people who really need assistance rather than to be penalized. We penalize smokers, for example, in health reform. We don't charge people more for other risk behaviors. In one way, this is a good thing because it encourages people to quit smoking. But there's a disturbing flip side to that that we have to somehow address.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: We have clearly stigmatized smokers. Smokers feel it, they know it. It's important that people understand that smoking is not this freely chosen behavior that adults pick up because they're doing it because they are pleased by it and get pleasure out of it. Do they get something out of it? Of course. The nicotine itself may actually be helping them in concentrating on their work or whatever it may be. Yet the fact is that smoking is by and large an addiction that is initiated during childhood when kids have no concept of what addiction is, and for that matter they have no conception of their own personal mortality. I also suspect that physicians today are not nearly as sympathetic with their smoking patients as physicians were a generation ago. Physicians today haven't ever smoked. They don't understand addiction. They\u2019ve read about it, but you have to have been there to really understand it. As a former smoker who tried quitting 4 times before I finally succeeded, I have a real appreciation of what the addiction is all about. It\u2019s important for people to appreciate the brain chemistry associated with smoking. Smoking is not just this pleasurable activity. As with other addictions, your brain is fundamentally altered by smoking. It requires nicotine to be satisfied. If laboratory animals are given the choice between food and water on the one hand or a drug to which they are addicted, many of them will choose the drug, to the point that they die for lack of sufficient nourishment. It's a powerful phenomenon. The penalties that we are imposing on smokers are considerable. I'm one of the people who was responsible in the 1980s for getting the idea out that cigarette taxation is an effective way to reduce smoking. We know that if you raise taxes substantially, you will reduce smoking considerably. At the same time, you're obviously raising revenue for the legislature. There\u2019s a real win-win aspect to this, but I worry about the low-income smokers who just aren't going to quit. Now it's true that when you raise the price, more poor people will quit. If you look at the disparity in health between rich and poor, the life expectancy difference is about 5 years or so. Smoking is probably the single most important factor in that disparity. In that sense, tobacco taxes can have a progressive impact on health. However, the vast majority of smokers, poor and rich, are not going to quit. Suppose you're charging $2 or $3 per-pack in taxes, which is fairly typical. Multiply that by 365 packs per year, and you're looking at a significant percent of many people's total income. That has an element of inequity to it. It's something that we in tobacco control don't address adequately. The answer we always give is, \"Well let's take the revenues and dedicate them to helping low-income people with smoking cessation, help them to pay for their smoking cessation pharmaceuticals, counseling, and so on.\" That's a nice answer for those who can quit that way and want to quit. It's not a good answer for those who either don't want to quit or are unsuccessful trying. ** _Tobacco harm reduction (THR)_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: This brings us to the contentious issue of \u201ctobacco harm reduction (THR)\u201d-- the search for other ways we could help people who smoke to either stop smoking or to reduce the harm that they will experience from their smoking. It seems like such a sensible idea to reduce people's risk, but the public health community seems split down the middle over this. Why is this such a controversial issue?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: Some smokers either cannot or will not give up their nicotine. That\u2019s what keeps them smoking, and dying. The idea underlying THR is that some of these inveterate smokers might be receptive to alternative forms of nicotine delivery that are much less dangerous. The principal examples are low-nitrosamine versions of smokeless tobacco and, more recently, electronic or e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes in particular have split the public health community. Some believe that their promotion as substitutes for smoking could do a great deal of good \u2013 getting inveterate smokers to switch to them \u2013 while many in the community fear that e-cigarettes will hook more kids on nicotine and \u201crenormalize\u201d smoking. I don't think I'd agree with you that the public health community is split down the middle. The public health community is very split, but the vast majority are opposed to the very idea of harm reduction. The idea that anybody would use anything with nicotine or tobacco offends most people in public health, especially most people at the grassroots in tobacco control. If you take the leadership or the intelligencia within tobacco control, it's fair to say there is a split pretty much down the middle. There's a long history of harm reduction in public health dating to methadone treatment and syringe exchange for heroin users to condom distribution in many Chicago public schools. Of course those are all very controversial measures. As I mentioned, THR reflects the notion that we need to do more for people who will not quit smoking because they want the nicotine or who cannot quit. If you provide people with some alternative method of getting their nicotine that's less dirty, less hazardous, their risk will be substantially reduced. People using low nitrosamine smokeless products, which are the most recent generation of smokeless tobacco products, are probably risking a minimal amount of disease compared to cigarettes. There\u2019s just a gigantic difference. People who are vaping, using e-cigarettes, are almost certainly greatly reducing their risk compared to cigarette smoking a lot. There is reason to believe that the e-cigarettes could be a good harm reduction technology. But we must remember that the public health community, the tobacco control community, has been burned by the idea of harm reduction. The first two generations of harm reduction were brought to us by tobacco industry. In the early 1950s they started advertising filtered cigarettes aggressively as taking the dangerous stuff out of smoke and allowing the flavor through. This was right after the cancer scare exemplified by that _Readers\u2019 Digest_ story. Filtered cigarettes were about 1% of the market in 1950. By 1960 they were the dominant product. It was 57% of the market. They were no safer. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Then there were the low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes. A prominent ad campaign for True cigarettes showed this very intelligent-looking business woman. She said: \"I've heard all that stuff they're saying about smoking. I decided I would either quit or smoke True. _I smoke True_.\" In other words it was a tempting alternative to quitting. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday In point of fact, it was a deception. We've had a chance to look at industry documents thanks to all the lawsuits. We now know that both filtered cigarettes and low-tar nicotine cigarettes were never considered by the industry to be health enhancing or risk reducing. Rather, they were public relations devices, methods of getting people to smoke more rather than quit. The cost has been enormous. Nobody knows how many millions of people have died as a result of those deceptions. That's important background to understanding why the tobacco control and public health communities look so askance at the idea of harm reduction. There are a large number of people, including some very important people in this community, who worry that e-cigarettes in particular are going to get many more young people, children, addicted to smoking. They worry about the notion that we're going to see people who have quit smoking resume their habit: They try vaping; they get addicted to the nicotine or get the nicotine taste. They end up back on cigarettes. There is also the worry that we are re-normalizing smoking, something we've spent so many years trying to denormalize. People will walk around in public vaping and it looks like smoking. It looks glamorous. Advertising for the predominant product, Blu, which is sold by Lorillard, a cigarette company, looks just like the glamorous and sex appeal ads for cigarettes that we saw three or four decades ago. So there are a lot of reasons to be worried about it. Having said that, there is real potential in these products, too. We need regulation that's going to make that work properly. Unfortunately, you run into a political morass. The FDA has that authority under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009. They can do the regulating, but the surrounding politics is terrifying, and it makes it very difficult for FDA to do what it needs to do. **Pollack: It's terrifying because of the influence of the industry or it's terrifying because of the intolerance of the basic idea of these products?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: Because of the direct and indirect influence of the industry. The indirect influence of the industry is on Congress and frankly the administration. This administration has not been friendly to tobacco regulation. That may seem odd since President Obama signed the law in 2009, but they haven't been very friendly since then. They\u2019ve had the opportunity with this new law to really accomplish something. It's just been revealed recently, just the last couple of days, that OMB has been involved in what regulation FDA can do. They have apparently removed language from FDA\u2019s proposed deeming regulation that pertained to the regulation of electronic cigarettes and what's called premium cigars. Who likes to smoke premium cigars? The very influential and affluent population. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday At every level of the politics this is ugly. Any time FDA proposes a regulation from the Center for Tobacco Products, if it has any potential to reduce cigarette smoking there will be industry lawsuits. It doesn't much matter to the industry whether these suits have ultimate legal merit. The main goal is to simply delay implementation of a regulation that cuts into industry cigarette sales. It's extremely difficult for FDA to do what, in an ideal public health world, it would do right away. ** _The Obama administration and tobacco control_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: Let\u2019s come back to something you just mentioned. Why do you think the Obama administration has been less of a friend to tobacco control than one might have expected?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: There is little pressure on the administration to do anything with regard to tobacco. There is a lot of pressure on the administration not to do anything with regard to tobacco. That's a powerful influence. I'll just give you an example that I find personally appalling. There's something that most people in the United States are completely unaware of called the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It is the world's first global public health treaty. It has been ratified at this point by 178 countries out of the 193 countries that are members of the World Health Organization. Only a few significant countries have not ratified this treaty, which by the way is being implemented around the world as we speak. The United States is the most important of those countries that have yet to ratify this treaty. Almost 90% of the world's population lives in countries that have ratified it. Americans don't even know about it. The Obama administration and previous administrations have not even brought it to the Senate for consideration. That's a powerful statement of how little influence the tobacco control and public health communities have on the administration today. **Pollack: It also speaks to the structure of the US Senate. Maybe that they haven't brought it forward because the framework convention has very little chance of getting the required super majority.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: That's absolutely correct, it's certainly a problem with the Senate, but you're not hearing anybody talking about this in either the Senate or the administration. It's a very important treaty and it's been adopted more widely and more rapidly than almost any other treaty in history. We're not a part of it. It's just a sad commentary on where the country is in that regard. **Pollack: There's also the question of how aggressively the US government assists the tobacco industry in international trade negotiations involving their product.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: It's going on right now with the trans-Pacific trade negotiations. It's a huge issue. It's true every time there's a treaty. ** _Looking ahead_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday **Pollack: If we continue on our present course how many people do you think are likely to die of smoking-related ailments over the coming decades.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Warner: Sadly, we can say quite confidently that the 480,000 deaths-per-year figure we're looking at now will continue for a long time. My colleague David Mendez and I have been researching trends in smoking prevalence since the early 1990s. Our forecasts have proved very accurate since then. We forecast what smoking trends will be at the rate we're going now using the evidence-based measures that we know work: Increasing price through taxation, smoke free laws, media campaigns, restricting advertising. If we simply do more of the same, we're going to be looking at a smoking prevalence rate in excess of 10% of the adult population by the year 2050. The implication is that we will experience hundreds of thousands of completely avoidable deaths every year for many decades into the foreseeable future. That's an appalling toll from any perspective. It\u2019s unacceptable. We need to do more than what we have done to this point. I actually believe there is an answer. We can reduce smoking-related deaths dramatically. Can we get rid of them entirely? Probably not, but we have the potential to reduce the toll to a relatively minor problem rather than a major one, which is it will remain through at least the middle of this century. The most important element lies in FDA regulation. What are now described as \u201cend-game\u201d proposals are emerging from the tobacco control community that go beyond the traditional tobacco control measures. I hope we can discuss those in some future conversation. These require unprecedented political will and bureaucratic tenacity, the latter on the part of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. Good policies in this area would prevent more death and illness than any other medical or public health intervention in the coming decades. All these require is for people \u2013 important people \u2013 to care more about public health than they do about making a buck or getting and staying elected. That \u201call,\u201d however, is an imposing barrier. The American public must also keep the pressure on, so that our government and our entire society aggressively and humanely confront a scourge that will kill 480,000 of our fellow citizens once again this year.", "Title: The FDA begins evaluating the risks and benefits offered by cigarette alternatives Content: IN 2009, Congress gave the Food and Drug Administration wide authority to oversee tobacco products. The agency has moved cautiously in flexing that power. On Thursday, for the first time, the FDA \u201cdeemed\u201d several tobacco products to be under its watch, including cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, hookahs and e-cigarettes. This move is welcome, if overdue. The FDA now has to conduct the tricky work of figuring out when further restrictions, particularly on e-cigarettes, help and when they might actually harm public health. As long as the FDA steers clear of direct regulation of products other than cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco, public health advocates rightly worry that potential smokers \u2014 particularly children and teenagers \u2014 will find it easier or more appealing to use unregulated products with varying or unknown public health effects. The agency says that expanding its oversight, which Congress gave it the power to do, is the first, \u201cfoundational\u201d step toward broad regulation of these alternatives to cigarettes. The FDA is demanding some concrete steps of manufacturers upfront. They will have to register their products with the agency and reveal their ingredients. They will have to attach warning labels. Many vending machines will become off-limits. And the federal government will ban e-cigarette sales to minors. Once regulators gather more information on the harm various products can cause and on how people are obtaining and using them, they can do more in the interest of public health, such as consider bans on Internet sales, candy-like flavorings or certain kinds of marketing. The FDA is also accepting feedback on whether to exempt \u201cpremium\u201d cigars from regulation, since people often do not smoke them habitually. That strikes us as unnecessary, because cigars, too, can do harm. If regulators determine that premium cigars do not pose the same public health risks as other products, they can keep the demands on their manufacturers relatively light. But for one product there is good reason for caution. E-cigarettes, which deliver a nicotine-laced vapor that presumably contains many fewer harmful ingredients than tobacco smoke, could help addicted, lifetime smokers to reduce their consumption or quit. On the other hand, e-cigarette use among young people is soaring, and there is concern that it might be a gateway to conventional smoking. In addition, some adult smokers may use e-cigarettes to augment their traditional cigarette habit when they otherwise might have kicked it. Unlike with many other nicotine-containing products, the FDA has to determine how to keep e-cigarettes available to those who might benefit from them while minimizing their capacity to hook young people or encourage continued smoking. Thursday\u2019s announcement is just the beginning of that process. **Read more about this topic:** The Post\u2019s View: Higher taxes on cigarettes make good sense The Post\u2019s View: E-cigarettes have risks but they also offer public health benefits The Post\u2019s View: CVS\u2019s smart shift away from tobacco", "Title: E-cigarette use triples among middle and high school students, study says Content: The number of middle and high school students using electronic cigarettes tripled from 2013 to 2014, according to government figures released Thursday, a startling increase that public health officials fear could reverse decades of efforts combating the scourge of smoking. The popularity of e-cigarettes among teenagers now eclipses that of traditional cigarettes, the use of which has fallen to the lowest level in years. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the spike in \u00ade-cigarette use \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad thing, and it is subjecting another generation of our children to an addictive substance,\u201d he said in an interview, adding that any type of nicotine exposure can harm the teenage brain and that some e-cigarette smokers undoubtedly will go on to use traditional cigarettes. Not everyone sees such cause for alarm in the new numbers. \u201cThe CDC should really be jumping for joy at the fact that smoking rates are declining. This is a huge success,\u201d said Michael Siegel, a professor and tobacco-control specialist at Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cInstead, they are using this as another opportunity to demonize e-cigarettes.\u201d Siegel said he agrees that minors shouldn\u2019t have access to any tobacco product. But he said the CDC numbers suggest that rather than serving as a gateway to cigarette smoking, e-cigarettes actually might be diverting teens from traditional cigarettes, which still account for nearly half a million tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. Thursday\u2019s findings came as little surprise to many educators around the country, who have increasingly wrestled with how to handle the swift rise in e-cigarette use among students. Patricia Sheffer, superintendent of the Union County school system in Kentucky, grew so frustrated this year over the dozens of incidents of students being caught with e-cigarettes that last month she sent a recorded message to district parents and posted a plea on Facebook asking for help cracking down on the problem. The dogs that perform a sweep of the schools about once a month also are being trained to sniff out \u00ade-cigarettes, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just growing at such a rapid pace,\u201d said Sheffer, who worries about the various substances students might be smoking in the devices. \u201cI thought, \u2018We have to take a stand.\u2019 \u201d School districts around the country, such as in North Carolina\u2019s Haywood County, are classifying e- cigarettes as drug paraphernalia, rather than as normal cigarettes, in hope that the more severe penalties will discourage students from bringing the devices to campus. \u201cIt was to send a message that we don\u2019t want it,\u201d said Associate Superintendent Bill Nolte. Anti-smoking advocates insist the rise in the popularity of \u00ade-cigarettes stems in part from aggressive marketing campaigns that Frieden called \u201cstraight out of the playbook\u201d of ads that targeted young people in earlier generations. E-cigarettes remain unregulated by the federal government, \u00adalthough numerous cities and states have passed laws restricting sales to minors and banning the devices in public places. But e-cigarettes do not face the same federal restrictions on television and radio advertising that apply to traditional cigarettes. \u201cThese are the same images, the same themes and the same role models that the cigarette industry used 50 years ago,\u201d said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. \u201cIt\u2019s the Marlboro Man reborn. It\u2019s the Virginia Slims woman re-created, with the exact same effect. . . . This is not an accident.\u201d Cynthia Cabrera, executive director of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, an industry group, said her organization supports banning sales to minors and disputed that e-cigarette companies are deliberately marketing to teens. She said that while tobacco giants with huge advertising budgets such as Lorillard and Altria have purchased e-cigarette companies in recent years, most e-cig marketing is still done by hundreds of small companies whose target audience is smokers looking for less-toxic options. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking this is Big Tobacco redux, that\u2019s the wrong thinking,\u201d she said. At the heart of the public health debate lies a series of unanswered questions: Are \u00ade-cigarettes unequivocally less harmful than tar-laden, chemical-filled tobacco cigarettes, as many people assume? Will they prove to be a healthier alternative that helps people avoid cigarette smoking and reduce tobacco- related deaths, or simply devices that could undermine decades of public health efforts? Siegel, the Boston University professor, said it \u201cshouldn\u2019t take a rocket scientist\u201d to figure out that \u201cvaping\u201d is safer than smoking, given that the liquids used in e- cigarettes involve no combustion and very few chemicals. Likewise, Cabrera said regulators shouldn\u2019t \u201close perspective about the potential\u201d for e-cigarettes to eliminate harm caused by smoking cigarettes. But plenty of uncertainty remains. A study published this week in the journal Tobacco Control, for instance, found that the chemicals used to flavor e-cigarettes could prove unsafe when inhaled over time. Public health officials say far more research is needed given how little data exists on the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. This much seems certain from Thursday\u2019s results, based on an annual survey of 22,000 students around the country: Teens are experimenting as much as ever. Roughly a quarter of high school students and nearly 8 percent of middle school students still report having used a tobacco product at least once in the past 30 days. But from 2013 to 2014, the findings say, e-cigarette use among high school students had increased from 4.5 percent to 13.4 percent. Usage also more than tripled among middle school students, from 1.1 percent to 3.9 percent. Only among black students was another tobacco product \u2014 cigars \u2014 more popular than \u00ade-cigarettes, the CDC said. During that same period, the use of hookahs \u2014 water pipes used to smoke specially made tobacco \u2014 roughly doubled for middle and high school students, equaling and eclipsing the use of regular cigarettes, respectively. Meanwhile, the use of conventional cigarettes sank to the lowest levels in years. According to the CDC, 9.2 percent of high school students reported smoking a cigarette over the past month, compared with 12.7 percent a year earlier. Middle school students\u2019 cigarette use dropped to 2.5 percent from 2.9 percent. While some people might see that as good news, anti-tobacco advocates and public health officials remain wary. \u201cThe drop in cigarette use is historic, with enormous public-health significance,\u201d Myers said. But, he quickly added, \u201cthe explosion of \u00ade-cigarette use among kids means these products are being taken up in record numbers with totally unknown long-term consequences that could potentially undermine all the progress we\u2019ve made.\u201d Last April, the Food and Drug Administration announced plans to begin regulating e-cigarettes, now a multibillion-dollar industry in the United States. The agency said it wants to force manufacturers to curb sales to minors, place health warning labels on the products and disclose their ingredients. The FDA\u2019s initial proposals stopped short of halting online e-cigarette sales, restricting television advertising, or banning candy and fruit flavorings \u2014 chocolate, cotton candy, passion fruit, pi\u00f1a colada and hundreds of others \u2014 that critics say appeal to young users. A year later, the FDA has yet to finalize any new regulations involving e-cigarettes, though its top tobacco official said in an interview Thursday that doing so remains \u201cour highest priority.\u201d \u201cThe numbers are astounding,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products, calling the recent jump in youth e-cigarette use a \u201cclarion call\u201d to bring the products under federal oversight. \u201cWhat this tells us is that with all the progress we\u2019ve made in reducing youth cigarette smoking, that progress is in jeopardy.\u201d Myers said Thursday\u2019s figures make clear that such action is long overdue, and that it can\u2019t come soon enough. \u201cThe failure of the FDA to move more quickly means we have an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the absence of strong governmental action, these numbers will only keep going up.\u201d"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the FDA's regulation of e-cigarettes, including the potential harm to public health and the lack of restrictions on certain aspects of the industry.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides a more comprehensive view of the FDA's actions and the potential implications for public health and the tobacco industry.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The agency finally has decided to begin using it more fully, announcing a final rule on e-cigarettes, cigars and hookahs."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage outlines the FDA's plan to regulate e-cigarettes, but it does not directly address the potential benefits to Big Tobacco or the potential harm to public health.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage provides relevant information about the FDA's actions, it does not provide as much detail or context as Passage 1.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The FDA\u2019s proposal stops short of broader restrictions sought by many\u00ad \u00adtobacco-control advocates."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the FDA's regulation of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, but it does not directly address the potential benefits to Big Tobacco or the potential harm to public health.", "listwise_reason": "This passage provides relevant information about the FDA's actions, but it does not provide as much detail or context as Passages 1 and 2.", "direct_answer_sentence": "On Thursday, for the first time, the FDA \u201cdeemed\u201d several tobacco products to be under its watch, including cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, hookahs and e-cigarettes."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the rise in e-cigarette use among teenagers, but it does not directly address the FDA's regulations, the potential benefits to Big Tobacco, or the potential harm to public health.", "listwise_reason": "While this passage provides relevant context about the use of e-cigarettes, it does not directly address the query as well as the other passages.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Not everyone sees such cause for alarm in the new numbers."}, {"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage primarily discusses the history of tobacco use and does not directly address the FDA's regulations, e-cigarettes, the potential benefits to Big Tobacco, or the potential harm to public health.", "listwise_reason": "This passage provides background information about tobacco use, but it is less directly relevant to the query than the other passages.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Cigarette smoking itself got going in a big way during World War I."}]}, "scores": [29.508499145507812, 27.783000946044922, 27.56410026550293, 27.30739974975586, 26.984600067138672]}

Reaction to Bettman\u2019s letter has been largely negative among hockey fans, some of whom believe Bettman has fallen behind the curve, especially in comparison to the NFL, which only this year acknowledged the link between concussions and CTE. When asked if he there was a link between football and CTE during a congressional roundtable in March, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president for health and safety, Jeff Miller, said, \u201cThe answer to that question is certainly yes.\u201d The NFL made the stunning admission after years of refuting a link while attempting to fight a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of former NFL players who suffered concussions while in the league. In April 2015, the court approved a settlement between the two sides and a year later, an appeals court upheld the decision that made the league accountable for upwards of $1 billion in monetary rewards to the group of around 4,500 retired players. The NHL, meanwhile, is currently fighting its own class-action lawsuit brought by more than 100 former players who suffered concussions and other brain injuries while playing. The plaintiffs claim while they understood their career choice could lead to broken bones and other bodily harm, they were not aware of the long-term effects of brain trauma associated with the game. The players are seeking medical care for themselves and roughly 4,300 living retired players. Bettman attempted to distance the NHL from comparisons to the NFL in his letter to Sen. Blumenthal, a tactic he\u2019s used earlier, as well. In a subsection of the letter that appeared to be composed with the help of a legal team, Bettman argued football and hockey are very different and, thus, should not be compared in terms of injury risk. He made similar remarks in March, directly after the NFL admitted the connection between football and CTE. \u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear that playing hockey isn\u2019t the same as football,\u201d he said then. \u201cNHL Hockey Is Different Than NFL Football,\u201d he titled a subsection of his letter that appeared to be written with the help of an attorney this week. \u201cUntil recently, the medical community\u2019s discussions about CTE did not even touch about NHL hockey,\u201d Bettman wrote. Indeed, researchers at Boston University\u2019s CTE center \u2014 the most publicized researchers on CTE in football \u2014 told the NHL (and me personally) that they believe that NHL hockey is a vastly different sport than football, making it difficult to necessarily relate or link hypotheses on CTE as between the two sports.\u201d He added: \u201cLikewise, any suggestion that the NHL has been \u2018dismissive\u2019 of a potential causal link between concussions and CTE is simply not true.\u201d Many hockey fans, however, are finding that statement hard to believe.", "Title: What the NFL\u2019s admission of a brain disease link means for the future of football Content: On Monday, an NFL official finally truly acknowledged what the families of Junior Seau and Mike Webster and Frank Gifford and Ken Stabler and many, many other football players have long known: There is a link between playing the game and degenerative brain disease. With that out in the open for the first time, the question now becomes: What changes going forward? The admission took all of two words. It came when Jeff Miller, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president for health and safety policy, was asked by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) in a Capitol Hill round-table discussion whether there was a link between football and diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). \u201cThe answer to that is certainly, yes,\u201d Miller responded. Certainly, yes. Years of kicking the issue down the road by the NFL, which Schakowsky said has had \u201ca very troubling track record of denying and discrediting scientific inquiry into the risks of playing football,\u201d appeared to have ended with those words. But it\u2019s never that simple with an issue that threatens a multi-billion-dollar industry. No sooner did Miller speak than the NFL issued a statement, saying that he was referring to research by Boston University neuropathologist Ann McKee, a top concussion expert. \u201cHe was discussing Dr. McKee\u2019s findings and made the additional point that a lot more questions need to be answered,\u201d NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a statement emailed to The Post. \u201cHe said that experts should speak to the state of the science.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That has long been the NFL\u2019s position. It has argued, as the link between repeated hits and later cognitive issues became increasingly apparent, that it was best to let the medical community determine whether there was a relationship between playing the game and CTE. As it waited \u201cto let the science go where the science goes,\u201d as McCarthy put it Monday night, big-name players were, one after the other, found to have had the disease in the only way presently possible, during autopsy. The news about Hall of Famer Ken Stabler was revealed during Super Bowl week and we\u2019ve reached the point at which a former football player who does _not_ have CTE is more surprising than not. Boston University researchers found evidence of CTE in the brains of 90 of 94 former NFL players. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But what happens now? Does an admission by Miller really change anything? Was it an over-reach that the league can downplay? Long-term, the game will evolve. Already, the NFL stresses that there is greater emphasis, for instance, on teaching kids safe tackling techniques and doing less tackling during practices even as more and more parents consider whether to let their kids play the sport. Much may have changed, but the NFL isn\u2019t entirely on board as it seeks to protect its business and, of course, it can be petty. Last December, the league backed out of an ambitious study aimed at finding a way to diagnose CTE in living patients, ESPN\u2019s \u201cOutside the Lines\u201d reported. \u201cThe seven-year, $16 million initiative was to be funded out of a $30 million research grant the NFL gave the National Institutes of Health in 2012,\u201d Steve Fainaru and Mark Fainaru-Wada wrote. \u201cThe NFL has said repeatedly that it has no control over how that money is spent, but the league balked at this study, sources said, because the NIH awarded the project to a group led by Dr. Robert Stern, a prominent Boston University researcher who has been critical of the league.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The NFL announced in 2012 that it would give the NIH $30 million \u201cwith no strings attached,\u201d but an NIH official told \u201cOTL\u201d two years later that the NFL had veto power over projects. Against that backdrop, Miller\u2019s comment was significant. It was so significant, in fact, that the NFL initially distanced itself from it, then sought to regain its footing Tuesday afternoon with a statement emailed to Maske in which McCarthy said, \u201cThe comments made by Jeff Miller yesterday accurately reflect the view of the NFL.\u201d Miller\u2019s comment had an almost immediate impact Tuesday morning in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which is hearing the appeal of the settlement between thousands of retired NFL players and the league. At issue is whether players found with CTE in the future should also be paid. As a result, lawyers pounced Miller\u2019s comments. In a letter to the court, the New York Times reports that the players\u2019 lawyer, Steven Molo, wrote: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cThe NFL\u2019s statements make clear that the NFL now accepts what science already knows: a \u2018direct link\u2019 exists between traumatic brain injury and CTE. Given that, the settlement\u2019s failure to compensate present and future CTE is inexcusable.\u201d With two little words \u2014 \u201ccertainly, yes\u201d \u2014 the story of CTE and the NFL may have begun to change.", "Title: The NFL can\u2019t seem to make up its mind on a link between concussions and CTE Content: BOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 The NFL made a seemingly straightforward admission last week when its top player safety official told a congressional committee that there is \u201ccertainly\u201d a link between football and degenerative brain disease. The acknowledgment earned praise from medical experts and touched off speculation about the potential ramifications for the league in court and among parents deciding whether to allow their children to play the game. Since then, however, prominent NFL figures have been far less definitive on the subject. At least two influential team owners, including the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Jerry Jones, said this week they aren\u2019t certain about the relationship between football and brain disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). And at a news conference Wednesday, Commissioner Roger Goodell did not directly answer a question about whether he and the league believe such a link exists. \u201cI think the most important thing for us is to support the medical [experts] and scientists who determine what those connections are,\u201d Goodell said. The lack of clarity on the issue points to a league still struggling to figure out how to deal with a complex subject that eventually could threaten its very survival. By acknowledging a link between football and CTE, legal experts say, the NFL could undermine its position in court, where a proposed settlement between the league and retired players is under appeal, and potentially create an open-ended liability with current and future players. \u201cI am not sure how we can react to their comments other than to simply shrug our shoulders and point,\u201d said George Atallah, the assistant executive director of external affairs for the NFL Players Association. \u201cWe know we have to work with them, and it is important to have a level of professional decorum because we have to get things done, but it is hard when they say the things they say with a straight face.\u201d Jeff Miller, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president of health and safety policy, made his attention-grabbing comment March 14 during a roundtable discussion on concussions before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was asked by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) about a link between football and CTE and replied that \u201cthe answer to that is certainly yes.\u201d It marked the first time a senior league official said a link existed, and the NFL issued a statement the following day saying Miller had not misspoken. \u201cThe comments made by Jeff Miller yesterday accurately reflect the view of the NFL,\u201d it said. League leaders were criticized as recently as at the Super Bowl last month for refusing to acknowledge a link between the sport and brain disease, which made Miller\u2019s comments that much more noteworthy, even apparently among some NFL team owners. \u201cIt took us by surprise,\u201d one owner said this week, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some team owners, who were gathered here this week for the league\u2019s annual meeting, went even further when questioned about whether they believe a relationship between football and CTE has been firmly established. \u201cNo, that\u2019s absurd,\u201d said Jones, the Cowboys\u2019 owner. \u201cThere\u2019s no data that in any way creates a knowledge. There\u2019s no way that you could have made a comment that there is an association and some type of assertion. In most things, you have to back it up by studies. And in this particular case, we all know how medicine is. Medicine is evolving.\u201d Jones added: \u201cWe have millions of people that have played this game, have millions of people that are at various ages right now that have no issues at all. None at all. So that\u2019s where we are. That didn\u2019t alter at all what we\u2019re doing about it. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to understand it better and make it safer.\u201d Jones\u2019s remarks were echoed by Robert McNair, owner of the Houston Texans. \u201cWe don\u2019t know does CTE exist among people who\u2019ve never had any contact? We don\u2019t know. Because when you\u2019re alive they can\u2019t check for it,\u201d McNair said, according to ESPN.com. \u201cThe only players, the brains that have been checked, were ones who clearly were having problems. So it wasn\u2019t a scientific sample that they were dealing with. We\u2019ve got thousands of players who are not suffering from dementia of any type. So we have a lot to learn yet.\u201d Chris Nowinski, a co-founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said Wednesday the owners\u2019 remarks were \u201cwoefully ill-informed\u201d given the overwhelming scientific and medical research that has established a link between brain trauma and CTE. \u201cWhen the world\u2019s top neuropathologists are on record saying they have never seen CTE in a brain donor who wasn\u2019t exposed to repetitive brain trauma, and the Mayo Clinic just published a paper that found zero cases of CTE in 188 controls, but 21 cases of CTE among 66 contact sport athletes, Bob McNair sounds foolish,\u201d Nowinski said in an email. At his news conference, Goodell played down the significance of Miller\u2019s acknowledgment of a link, saying it was \u201cconsistent with our position over the years.\u201d That was the same position taken by NFL attorney Paul Clement, who wrote a letter last week to the appeals court considering objections to the potential $1 billion concussion settlement in which he said that Miller\u2019s admission \u201cis consistent with NFL positions in court and otherwise.\u201d Lawyers for some players involved in the lawsuit against the NFL, however, contend that the admission buttresses their argument that the league\u2019s proposed settlement with retired players be extended to include future cases of CTE. Some outside legal experts agree. Arthur R. Miller, a professor at the New York University law school and director of the school\u2019s Tisch Institute for sports management, media and business, said last week that the NFL\u2019s CTE acknowledgment carried legal risk. \u201cAlthough there is a settlement, the settlement might not be approved by the appellate court,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could conceivably hurt them in this litigation or in future litigation. Additionally, it changes the dynamics of the next labor negotiation with the NFL Players Association. It becomes a labor-management issue.\u201d The NFL\u2019s annual revenues are estimated to be in excess of $13 billion; the league has set a goal of $25 billion in revenues by 2027. Future costs of concussion-related litigation are among the chief issues facing the sport going forward, sports business experts have said.", "Title: NFL stands by safety official\u2019s acknowledgement of CTE link to football Content: The NFL is standing by the acknowledgement on Capitol Hill by its top player safety official of a link between football and degenerative brain disease. \u201cThe comments made by Jeff Miller yesterday accurately reflect the view of the NFL,\u201d league spokesman Brian McCarthy said in a written statement provided Tuesday to The Washington Post. Miller, the NFL\u2019s senior vice president for health and safety policy, was asked during a round-table discussion Monday by Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) whether there is a link between football and degenerative brain disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. Miller said that \u201cthe answer to that is certainly, yes.\u201d It was believed to be the first public acknowledgement by the NFL of such a link. League leaders previously said they would leave it to researchers and medical experts to determine whether such a link exists. Miller cited the work of Ann McKee and other researchers at Boston University who have found the disease when examining the brains of deceased NFL players. Miller said he would defer to medical experts on questions about the prevalence of the disease among players. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that they did it,\u201d Robert Cantu, a clinical professor of neurosurgery at Boston University and co-director of BU\u2019s CTE Center, said in a phone interview Tuesday of the NFL\u2019s acknowledgement. \u201cAll the signs at BU and around the world have connected this. We\u2019re connecting the dots. \u2026 I think it\u2019s very positive that the NFL has stepped forward. I look forward to other sports stepping forward as well.\u201d Cantu is a senior adviser to the NFL\u2019s head, neck and spine committee and a section co-chair of the NFL Players Association\u2019s traumatic brain injury committee. \u201cI think football has taken the lead and that\u2019s great,\u201d Cantu said. \u201cFootball has also taken the lead in terms of reducing the amount of head contact allowed in practices and so forth. I would have preferred to see this happen earlier but I\u2019m pleased that it did happen. It\u2019s an acknowledgement of what a number of us felt the science proved a number of years ago. The NFL promised it would go where the science leads. They\u2019ve become the first major sport to do so.\u201d Schakowsky and three other Democratic members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee wrote Tuesday to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking what further steps the league plans to take. The letter was co-authored by Reps. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, Gene Green of Texas and Diana DeGette of Colorado. \u201cWe are encouraged by the NFL\u2019s willingness to accept the science linking the repetitive hits inherent to football with CTE,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWe seek to better understand whether this new attitude will translate into additional actionable measures to prevent repetitive brain trauma in current players, encourage programs and protocols to protect children in the youth leagues, and provide support for current and retired players at risk of this disease. The NFL\u2019s leadership on this issue can serve as a guide to other professional sports leagues and youth sports organizations seeking to limit risks for their players.\u201d The NFL\u2019s acknowledgement raises questions about potential future legal liability and about participation rates in youth tackle football going forward, experts said. The league\u2019s settlement with a group of former players who sued over concussion-related issues is before a federal appeals court. \u201cAlthough there is a settlement, the settlement might not be approved by the appellate court,\u201d said Arthur R. Miller, a university professor at the New York University law school and director of the school\u2019s Tisch Institute for sports management, media and business. \u201cIt could conceivably hurt them in this litigation or in future litigation. Additionally, it changes the dynamics of the next labor negotiation with the NFL Players Association. It becomes a labor-management issue.\u201d The appeals court is considering objections by groups of players to the class-action concussion settlement, and an attorney for an objecting group wrote to the court about Miller\u2019s acknowledgement. Christopher Seeger, co-lead counsel for the player class plaintiffs, said in a written statement Tuesday that the objections to the settlement \u201care without merit\u201d and the settlement, in his view, should be approved. \u201cWe welcome the NFL\u2019s acknowledgement of what was alleged in our complaint: that reports have associated football with findings of CTE in deceased former players,\u201d Seeger said. \u201cRetired NFL players brought this case to obtain security and care for the devastating brain injuries they were experiencing at a rate much greater than the general population. The settlement achieves that, providing immediate care to the sickest retired players and long-term security over the next 65 years for those who are healthy now but develop a qualifying condition in the future. \u201cHowever, as the district court correctly held, the scientific study into CTE is in its infancy and a reliable method for detecting it in living people does not exist. Therefore, the settlement provides compensation and care for those who exhibit neurocognitive symptoms associated with CTE\u2013dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and ALS\u2013importantly without having to prove the cause or link to CTE.\u201d The NFL filed a letter, written by attorney Paul Clement, with the appeals court late Tuesday saying that Miller\u2019s admission on Capitol Hill \u201cis consistent with NFL positions in court and otherwise. The NFL has previously acknowledged studies identifying a potential association between CTE and certain football players, including Dr. [Ann] McKee\u2019s work, to which the NFL has contributed funding.\u201d Clement also wrote in the NFL\u2019s filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit: \u201cSimply put, Mr. Miller\u2019s remarks have no bearing on the pending appeal.\u201d Cantu said that Miller\u2019s acknowledgement is not meaningful to future research but could be meaningful to the public\u2019s perception of the research that is done. He expressed hope that the NFL\u2019s admission of a link between football and CTE will lead parents to reconsider allowing children to play tackle football at a young age. \u201cI think it will help immensely,\u201d Cantu said. \u201cI sure hope so. I sure hope with regard to football, the rise in participation in flag football being greater than [the most recent increase in participation] in tackle football is significant. I think to the greater extent we can replace tackle football with flag football, it\u2019s all positive.\u201d Figures released Monday showed participation in flag football among 6- to 14-year-olds up 8.7 percent in 2015 over 2014, compared to a 1.9 percent increase for tackle football. Among 15- to 18-year-olds, participation in flag football was up 10.5 percent while participation in tackle football was up 2.5 percent. The figures were part of an annual Physical Activity Council participation report. Steve Alic, a spokesman for USA Football, a national governing body for youth football that is also part of the U.S. Olympic Committee, said his organization is \u201ccontinually working to improve what we offer\u201d in promoting proper education and safety measures for tackle football at all levels. Alic said it is \u201ctoo early to tell\u201d if the increased participation in tackle football last year over 2014 is a trend, adding that \u201cbetter education and standards may translate to better participation.\u201d", "Title: NFL owners surprised by league official\u2019s CTE admission Content: BOCA RATON, Fla. \u2014 NFL owners were caught off guard by the acknowledgement to a Congressional panel last week by a top league safety official of a link between football and degenerative brain disease. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cIt took us by surprise,\u201d one NFL owner said at this week\u2019s annual league meeting of the response to the statement made by Jeff Miller.

Candidates such as Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, have argued forcefully against reductions to Social Security. \"This is a matter not of math, this is a matter of morality,\" Huckabee said in Wednesday night's prime-time primary debate on CNBC. \"If this country does not keep its promise to seniors, what promise can it hope to be trusted to keep?\" On the other hand, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and other candidates say that reducing future benefits for people who are working now is the only way to make sure that there's enough money in the system to go around. Christie argued for that point in the debate by claiming that Social Security's trust fund has been emptied. The trust fund is where all of the money that workers forfeit in taxes with every paycheck they cash is kept, in order to pay out future benefits. \"It's not there anymore. The government stole it and spent it,\" Christie said. \"All that's in that trust fund is a pile of IOUs for money on they spent on something else a long time ago.\" Social Security's finances are not in the best shape, but the money is still in the trust fund -- to the tune of $2.8 trillion at the end of last year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It wasn't clear exactly what Christie meant when he claimed that the government had somehow stolen all that money, but perhaps he was referring to the fact that Social Security isn't just sitting on $2.8 trillion in cash. Instead, the money is invested in Treasury bonds. In other words, Social Security loaned the money to the Treasury Department, which is using it for all kinds of things -- to pay soldiers' salaries, make grants to researchers, maintain highways and whatever else the government needs money for. The Treasury then pays Social Security interest on the loans. Perhaps Christie was suggesting that those \"IOUs,\" in his words, won't be paid back, but few mainstream economists believe that the federal government will be unable to pay back all its debts. That fact is reflected in the extraordinarily low interest rates that investors worldwide will accept to loan the government money. If they were concerned about the government's ability to pay its debts, they would demand higher interest rates to compensate them for the risk of default. Christie said that he and the other presidential candidates need to tell elderly Americans \"the truth.\" Christie also said that Social Security would be \"insolvent\" in six to seven years. Again, it is unclear to what the governor was referring. Social Security's obligations in the long term are greater than its expected revenues. Starting in about two decades, Social Security won't be able to pay beneficiaries in full if current trends continue (although they would still receive a portion of their checks). In that sense, you could say Social Security is insolvent today. Perhaps Christie meant that in six to seven years, Social Security will have to begin drawing money from the trust fund, according to program's analysts. Currently, Social Security is still taking in more money in taxes than it is paying out in benefits. That is soon to change, but because the trust fund has $2.8 trillion in it, the change won't affect Social Security payments for another 15 years or so after that. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: A cut to Social Security disability benefits may be around the corner Content: The annual check-up for Social Security is in, and one program looks more dire than the rest. If Congress doesn\u2019t act, people receiving Social Security disability benefits could see a nearly 20 percent cut to payments at the end of next year, according to the latest version of the Social Security trustees report released Wednesday. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The disability trust fund will be depleted by the fourth quarter of 2016, leaving the administration with enough income to pay 81 percent of benefits, according to the report, which is updated annually. The health of the Social Security program didn\u2019t change by much, and the cut to disability benefits has been expected for years. But now that Congress has still not come up with a compromise for boosting the funding, the shortfall is more imminent. As explained in the report\u2019s summary: The cuts would most immediately affect the 10.9 million people receiving disability benefits as of 2014, but other beneficiaries could see benefit cuts down the line. If Congress doesn\u2019t act to reform the program, the trust fund used for retirement benefits would be depleted by 2035, a year later than previously expected. Some policy experts say Congress could act to reform the program just in time to avoid the cuts to disability benefits, but any fix may be short term. Lawmakers could decide to redirect some of the payroll taxes going to the retirement trust fund to fill the gap in disability benefits, says Shai Akabas, associate director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cEverybody is in agreement that something needs to happen,\u201d Akabas says. \u201cBut until the two parties come together on a compromise, that puts people in a high state of uncertainty.\u201d Another possibility is that lawmakers could come up with a short-term fix to boost the financing for the disability program while also changing benefits in some way. For example, President Obama recently proposed making it so that people who receive unemployment benefits cannot receive Social Security disability benefits at the same time. (Currently you can receive both.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A less likely scenario is that lawmakers could use the urgency of the cuts to disability benefits to come up with broader reform that would stabilize funding for the entire Social Security program, Akabas says, though that would be harder to pull off politically. The Social Security program hasn\u2019t been reformed substantially in decades \u2014 and lawmakers have a track record of waiting until cuts are about to happen. A bipartisan commission led by Alan Greenspan in the 1980s called for increasing the payroll tax, gradually increasing the retirement age and introducing a partial tax on benefits, among other adjustments. The changes were eventually approved in 1983, the year that it was expected that the Social Security trust fund would be depleted. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Read more:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Five of the most important facts everyone gets wrong about Social Security *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico What age is best to start drawing Social Security benefits?

Martin O'Malley called for more generous Social Security benefits, partly paid for with higher taxes on workers who make more than $250,000 a year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The presidential contender's proposal is similar to the one released earlier this year by his rival, Bernie Sanders. President Obama had advanced the idea as a candidate in the 2008 campaign, but the consensus among Democrats is still missing an important member. Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in next year's primary, has yet to put out a detailed plan. In 2008, she said she opposed the tax increase, although she recently suggested her views may be changing. _[Clinton is open to raising Social Security taxes on six-figure earners]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico With relatively few workers saving for retirement, progressive activists and Democrats in Congress have argued for fattening Americans' monthly Social Security checks. At the same time, the system's trust fund will be exhausted sometime about 20 years from now, according to current projections. If that happens, Social Security won't be able to pay out in full the benefits that retirees would be owed, even at the current level. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Higher taxes on well-heeled workers could help pay for more generous benefits. Workers only pay Social Security taxes on their yearly income below a certain limit. This year, the limit is $118,500 in earnings. They won't pay taxes on the rest, and Social Security will not count anything above that limit toward their benefits. O'Malley and Sanders would impose Social Security payroll taxes on workers who earn more than $250,000 a year. Workers who make less than $250,000 but more than the existing limit ($118,500 this year) would pay the same amount in taxes. _ [A simple guide to the real differences between the Democratic candidates for president] _ Sanders proposed a larger tax increase than O'Malley did. The independent senator from Vermont also called for an additional 6.2 percent tax on investment income above $250,000, which would ensure that wealthy people who get most of their income from dividends and stock sales instead of salaries also pay more into Social Security. Social Security actuaries project that under Sanders's proposal, the system's trust fund would be exhausted in 50 years, rather than 20, as shown in the chart below. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico O'Malley's proposal does not include a tax on investment income, and also includes other benefits not in Sanders's plan. O'Malley wants to allow people who take time off work to care for a child or aging parent credit that time toward their benefits when they retire, even though they may have limited or no income in those years. Independent estimates of how O'Malley's plan would affect Social Security's finances in the long term aren't available yet, but his proposal would probably would do less to shore up the system than Sanders's would. \"Social Security remains an especially critical lifeline for our parents and grandparents,\" O'Malley's plan reads. \"We should expand Social Security so they can retire with the dignity they have earned over the course of their working lives.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[Read more: O\u2019Malley proposes expanding Social Security benefits, other measures to aid seniors]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Andrew Biggs, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said O'Malley's math didn't add up. \"The very definition of fiscal irresponsibility is promising more benefits before you've figured out how to pay the benefits you\u2019ve already promised,\" Biggs said. Americans generally agree that Social Security should be expanded. Polls show that Americans support increases in Social Security taxes, along with more generous benefits. But that doesn't mean a change in the limit on taxable income would be easy to move through Congress. Sanders's proposal, in particular, would amount to a substantial tax increase on the rich. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Social Security disability trust fund projected to run out of cash by 2016 Content: A government entitlement program is headed for insolvency in four years, and it\u2019s not the one members of Congress are talking about most. The Social Security disability program\u2019s trust fund is projected to run out of cash far sooner than the better-known Social Security retirement plan or Medicare. That will trigger a 21 percent cut in benefits to 11 million Americans \u2014 people with disabilities, plus their spouses and children \u2014 many of whom rely on the program to stay out of poverty. \u201cIt\u2019s really striking how rapidly this is growing, how big it\u2019s become and how D.C. is just afraid of it,\u201d said Mark Duggan, a University of Pennsylvania economist and adviser to the Social Security Administration. Part of the reason for the burgeoning costs is that the 77 million baby boomers projected to swamp federal retirement plans will reach the disability program first. That\u2019s because almost all boomers are at least 50 years old, the age at which someone is most likely to become disabled. The growing costs are also a result of the economy\u2019s troubles. When people can\u2019t find work and run through their jobless benefits, many turn to disability benefits for assistance. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate,\u201d said Ken Nibali, a retired associate commissioner of the program. \u201cSome who are marginal and struggling to have a low-paying job now literally have no options.\u201d So, he said, \u201cthey figure, \u2018I do have trouble working, and I\u2019m going to apply and see if I\u2019m eligible.\u2019 \u201d Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), said he has tried to interest fellow lawmakers in the issue, without much luck. \u201cNobody wants to touch things where they can be criticized,\u201d Coburn said, adding, \u201cthe fund is going bankrupt\u201d and \u201cthen what are we going to do?\u201d Applications to the disability program have risen more than 30 percent since 2007 \u2014 the last recession started in December that year \u2014 and the number of Americans receiving disability benefits is up 23 percent. More Americans receive disability benefits than 20 years ago, although people are less likely to have physically demanding jobs, health care has improved and the Americans With Disabilities Act bans discrimination against those with handicaps. Social Security is made up of two programs: the retirement plan supporting 40 million senior citizens and 6 million survivors, and the disability insurance program created during the Eisenhower administration. The disability program pays benefits averaging $1,111 a month, with the money coming from the Social Security payroll tax. The program cost $132 billion last year, more than the combined annual budgets of the departments of Agriculture, Homeland Security, Commerce, Labor, Interior and Justice. That doesn\u2019t include an additional $80 billion spent because disability beneficiaries become eligible for Medicare, regardless of their age, after a two-year waiting period. The disability program is projected to exhaust its trust fund in 2016, according to a Social Security trustees report released last month. Once it runs through its reserve, incoming payroll-tax revenue will cover only 79 percent of benefits, according to the trustees. Because the plan is barred from running a deficit, aid would have to be cut to match revenue. Duggan said the disability plan has been running on autopilot for decades and lawmakers could find savings to help avoid the scheduled cuts. While federally financed, the program is administered by the states, and disability rates among them vary widely. West Virginia topped the list in 2010, with 9 percent of residents between ages 18 and 64 receiving aid. Utah and Alaska had the lowest rates at 2.8 percent. People whose benefit applications are rejected can appeal to administrative-law judges, and statistics show some judges are far more likely to approve benefits than others. One reason is that the program, which once focused largely on people who suffered from strokes, cancer and heart attacks, increasingly supports those with depression, back pain, chronic fatigue syndrome and other comparatively subjective conditions. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very hard to evaluate,\u201d said Nicole Maestas, director of the Rand Center for Disability Research. \u201cReasonable people differ about what constitutes a disability.\u201d Statistics show that once people enter the program they are unlikely to leave, with fewer than 1 percent rejoining the workforce. Many worked \u201cmenial\u201d jobs that didn\u2019t offer health insurance, and the program gives them an opportunity to join Medicare long before they might otherwise qualify, Nibali said. The agency faces a backlog of 1.4 million reviews it\u2019s supposed to periodically conduct to ensure beneficiaries are entitled to stay on the rolls. The agency has said it doesn\u2019t have the money to do the reviews. Neither President Obama nor House Republicans in their proposed budgets has addressed the disability program\u2019s shortfall. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to fix every problem in America with this one document,\u201d said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) of his budget plan. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to prevent a debt crisis, and this is not a driver of our debt.\u201d \u201cThe administration believes that disability insurance is a vital lifeline for millions of Americans,\u201d Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for the White House budget office, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe president remains willing to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to strengthen Social Security and protect the millions of beneficiaries.\u201d He added that lawmakers didn\u2019t fully fund the administration\u2019s request for more money to screen beneficiaries. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), whose committee sets Social Security policy, said the program\u2019s finances are less dire than they may appear. Congress can funnel revenue from elsewhere in the government to cover the program\u2019s shortfall, he said. ** \u2014 Bloomberg News **", "Title: Stop with the zombie lies: No, Social Security is not \u2018going broke.\u2019 Content: Even though last night\u2019s Republican debate featured precious little discussion of the size of the candidates\u2019 hands, there was plenty to be disappointed and angered by. The moment that perturbed me the most was when CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, who ought to know better, said that \u201cSocial Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years.\u201d The discussion about America\u2019s most successful and beloved social program had some interesting implications for the general election. But before we get to that, I need to say this slowly and clearly, so there\u2019s no misunderstanding: ** _Social Security is not going to \u201crun out of money.\u201d_** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The idea that the program is going to \u201crun out of money\u201d or is \u201cgoing broke\u201d is a zombie lie, one that deserves to have its head lopped off with a quick slice of Michonne\u2019s katana. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We\u2019re going to have to get a little wonky for a bit, but I\u2019ll try to make this as painless as possible. The short version: under the worst-case scenario, meaning that a poor economy in coming years deprives the system of money and no changes to the program\u2019s financing are made, then Social Security recipients will find themselves getting smaller checks than they ought to. And that would be a bad thing \u2014 if you rely on Social Security as your main or only source of income, it would be terrible to get only 77 percent of what you should (I\u2019ll reveal why I\u2019m using that number in a moment). But if the program were only able to deliver 77 percent of its benefits, it would not be \u201cbroke\u201d or have \u201crun out of money.\u201d When the entitlement doomsayers use those words, they want everyone to believe that the program will be, well, broke, which would mean it would be able to pay _nothing_ to the recipients. And that\u2019s a lie. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Let\u2019s remind ourselves how this program works. Workers pay Social Security taxes, which are then distributed to today\u2019s recipients as benefits. But when the taxes (and the interest the program earns on the bonds it holds) exceed the benefits, what\u2019s left over goes into a trust fund, commonly known as the \u201cSocial Security surplus.\u201d According to the latest report from the Social Security Trustees, in 2014 the program took in $769 billion and paid out $714 billion. The extra $55 billion went into the trust fund, which at the end of that year contained $2.729 trillion. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We\u2019re going to need the trust fund, because the very large Baby Boom generation has just started to retire, meaning more people are going to be drawing benefits. The Trustees\u2019 projections say that starting in 2020, the program will take in less than it\u2019s paying out, and the trust fund will be exhausted in 2035. Now this is important: the _whole point_ of the trust fund is to be there when that year\u2019s taxes aren\u2019t enough to pay that year\u2019s benefits. When we take money out of the trust fund, it isn\u2019t some kind of crisis, it\u2019s the system working as it was intended. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But won\u2019t the system be \u201cbroke\u201d in 2035? No. Under these projections, in 2035 we\u2019d only be paying out to recipients what we take in through taxes. At that point, recipients would get paid only 77 percent of their promised benefits. As I said, this would be a very bad thing. But is it going to happen? It\u2019s important to remember that the trustees make _projections_ , so there\u2019s a good deal of uncertainty around the numbers. It all depends on what kinds of assumptions you make about the future, particularly on what you think the economy will look like. If the economy is stronger, that means more tax revenue coming in, and the program can pay more benefits; if the economy is weaker, the program has more challenges. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Because of that uncertainty, the Trustees actually make three sets of projections, what they call high-cost, low-cost, and intermediate. It\u2019s the intermediate one that everyone reports, and that\u2019s where the date of 2035 and the figure of 77 percent of benefits come from. Without going too deeply into it, everything depends on how optimistic or pessimistic you want to be about America\u2019s economic future, in terms of things like economic growth, productivity growth, and unemployment. Many people argue that the Trustees are unduly pessimistic about the future, and the most realistic projection is not the intermediate one but the one they call low-cost. And under that projection, the surplus _never_ runs out, and we have plenty of funds to pay all benefits essentially forever, or at least for the next 75 years, which is how far out they attempt to project. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We aren\u2019t going to settle that right now, but there\u2019s an important piece of this to understand, which is that here in Washington, the opinion of Very Serious People is that Social Security is headed for disaster (along with Medicare, which is its own story), and the only thing to do is to either make people wait longer until they retire or cut their benefits. Indeed, proclaiming that you want to do one of those two things (or both) is in some circles how you demonstrate that you\u2019re Very Serious about this issue. There is an entire mini-industry of think-tanks and advocates devoted to convincing lawmakers and the public that entitlements are a disaster in the making, so we need to cut them. But there are other ways you could solve the problem, if it indeed turns out to be a problem. You could increase the cap on Social Security taxes \u2014 right now you only pay them on the first $118,500 of your income, which means that someone earning below that pays 6.2 percent of their income in Social Security taxes, while a hedge fund manager making $11.8 million pays only .062 percent of his income. You could also increase the tax itself, say by a tenth of a percent per year over ten years, which people would find imperceptible. In other words, you could maintain (or even increase) benefits by bringing in more money. In last night\u2019s debate, Marco Rubio said: \u201cSocial Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.\u201d This is the kind of completely ridiculous fear-mongering that gets you rounds of applause from those who want to cut the program. He then explained that he wants to raise the retirement age from 66 to 70 and reduce benefits (but of course, he says these things will happen in the future and not affect current retirees, who vote in such high numbers and are rather protective of their benefits). Ted Cruz said that he wants to slow the rate of growth in benefits (they\u2019re adjusted for the cost of living) and convert some part of them to stock market accounts. But it\u2019s what Donald Trump said that\u2019s genuinely interesting: Strip away all the Trumpian bluster, and what you have is 1) a pledge not to cut benefits or raise the retirement age; and 2) the assurance that the program\u2019s cost will be covered because the economy will perform well. Trump sounds an awful lot like\u2026a liberal! When Trump says, \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019re up against,\u201d he seems to be saying that because the Democrats want to increase benefits, they\u2019ll be able to present themselves as the program\u2019s protectors and criticize Republicans for trying to undermine it (unless he\u2019s the nominee). And about that, he\u2019s right. Democrats will do that, because that\u2019s what they almost always do. It\u2019s usually an effective attack, both because Americans love Social Security, and because it\u2019s true. So how does Trump compare to the Democrats, and what is the debate on this issue in the general election going to look like? Bernie Sanders\u2019 position is that benefits should be expanded, particularly since so many Americans lack retirement savings. He has proposed keeping the cap, but having the tax kick in again above $250,000, essentially inserting a \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d in the tax; he has also suggested applying the tax to wealthy households\u2019 investment income, and not just wages as it is now. Hillary Clinton has a similar, though less detailed, position: she rules out increasing the retirement age or cutting benefits, and wants to raise the cap to some unspecified level in order to increase some benefits. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Trump has broken with Republican orthodoxy in a few areas where Republican orthodoxy is deeply unpopular, and this is one of them. He probably has the political calculation right: it will be hard for Clinton or Sanders to go after him on Social Security when he\u2019s pledging to protect it without any changes. They\u2019re not going to move to his right on the issue, and while they\u2019ve staked out a position somewhat to his left, he\u2019ll be offering much the same result, without having to pay for it. A tax increase, he\u2019ll say, won\u2019t be necessary because when I\u2019m president gold will practically fall from the sky. Is that going to work? Frankly, I suspect it will, at least in taking Social Security off the table as an issue of contention between the two party nominees.

Researchers don't know what causes the virus to reactivate, and there is no cure once it does. The only way to prevent the disorder is by vaccinating everyone possible against measles. The first MMR dose is typically administered at 12 to 15 months of age. (Babies may be vaccinated at age 6 months or older if they are at risk of exposure to measles, for instance if they are traveling to an area with an outbreak.) Unvaccinated babies can be infected with measles and later develop this complication, which is called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE. \u201cThis is really frightening and we need to see that everyone gets vaccinated,\u201d James Cherry, a study author and expert on pediatrics and infectious diseases at UCLA's medical school, said at a press conference Friday. He said the findings suggest that other cases of SSPE are likely occurring and being missed. Many parents who intentionally refuse to vaccinate their children believe \"they are trying to do the right thing,\" said Gary Marshall, a pediatrics professor at the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky. \"Unfortunately, they're mistaken.

Vaccinating a very high proportion of the population \u2014 typically about 90 percent regardless of the disease \u2014 ensures herd immunity, which means those who can't be inoculated are still protected because the disease is less likely to spread. The MMR vaccine isn't recommended until after a first birthday because children retain some of their mother's antibodies until that age, making the vaccine less effective, experts say. Others who can't get vaccinated include people with immune system disorders. The researchers analyzed cases of California children who got measles between 1998 and 2015, finding that 1 in 1,387 were younger than 5 when they were infected. They identified 17 cases of SSPE during that period, all of whom had measles before being vaccinated. All but one of those patients have died. A 5-year-old boy, who was infected during travel to Germany, is now in hospice, unable to move or respond to commands, researchers said. The average age of SSPE diagnosis was 12, but the range was from 3 to 35 years. Many of the patients had ongoing cognitive or movement problems before they were definitively diagnosed. SSPE typically progresses in stages. Initially, the signs are subtle, starting with behavioral problems, Cherry said. Then seizures develop until the person becomes comatose. An additional suprising finding is that Asians are disproportionately affected by SSPE, Cherry said. He is not sure why but suspects the disorder could behave like some other diseases, such as influenza, which seem to hit Asians harder and cause higher mortality than other ethnic groups. Measles infection causes fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, sore throat and rash. The virus spreads throughout the body and is usually cleared within 14 days. In rare cases, the virus spreads to the brain but then becomes dormant. Eventually, that can lead to SSPE and result in death. Among other severe complications of measles, as many as 1 of every 20 children will develop pneumonia \u2014 actually the most common cause of death from measles in young children. And about 1 of every 1,000 children will develop encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, that can lead to convulsions and can leave the child deaf or with intellectual disability. Because there is a 5 percent failure rate with the MMR vaccine, a second dose is given to children before they begin school. Measles is so contagious that 95 percent of people need to be vaccinated with two doses to protect those who aren't, experts say. That means all who are eligible, including adults who haven't been previously vaccinated, should receive two doses of the vaccine.

The chart below, created by Valentine Svensson, a PhD student in molecular biology at Cambridge University, shows the dramatic decline in the incidence of measles in 20th century America. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico You can see that the incidence of measles fell sharply after the vaccine was introduced in 1963, only 50 years ago. As the vaccine did its work, the incidence of measles dropped to zero by the end of the century. (The left-hand axis is graphed as a base 10 log, a common technique that statisticians use to bring in spread-out values and illuminate a trend.) Lest we forget where we came from, here's a map that shows how deadly measles was in 1880. The map shows the ratio of deaths from measles to aggregate deaths, based on the tenth census ever conducted in this country. The graph at the lower left hand corner of the page shows how the states compared in terms of deaths by measles, while the key at the bottom right hand corner of the page tells you how many deaths the different shaded areas correspond to. (Click on the map, which is republished courtesy of the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection **,** to enlarge.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In most states, fewer than 30 deaths per 1,000 were due to measles, or less than 3 percent of overall deaths. In some parts of Georgia, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas, however, that proportion reached 3-6 percent of deaths, while in New Mexico it topped 6 percent of all deaths. Finally, here's a graphic showing how measles spreads in an area without a vaccination program, by Bonnie Berkowitz and Lazaro Gamio of The Washington Post. The differently shaded squares represent four generations of infection, from Patient Zero (the darkest red square at the top left) to the people he or she infects (the next 17 reddish squares), the people they infect in turn (the next five lines of peach-colored squares), and the people they infect (the rest of the graphic). The dark squares represent the people who die from measles. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Without vaccinations, each measles case will infect 12 to 18 other people on average every 10 to 14 days. You can see how quickly the disease spreads from the first generation (Patient Zero) to 12 to 18 people in the second generation, 144-324 people in the third generation, and 1728-5832 people in the fourth generation. That adds up to more than 6,000 infections, all within 40 days. In a country with substandard healthcare and malnutrition, up to 28 percent of those infected will die. Now contrast that with a country with full vaccination: In that scenario the disease would spread to 0.8 people every 10 to 14 days, and less than .3 percent will die. In a country like the United States, where most people have been vaccinated but pockets have not, the disease would spread to 1.1 to 2 people every 10-14 days and less than .3 percent would die. **More posts fromKnow More, Wonkblog's social media site: ** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Where America\u2019s uninsured, untreated, mentally ill live_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Map: Where Americans are dying before their time_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _The terrifying rise of diabetes, in every corner of the U.S._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Why measles should be the thing that freaks politicians out Content: _This post has been updated._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Gov. Chris Christie's (R-N.J.) declaration on Monday that vaccinations against diseases like measles should incorporate a \"balance\" of parental concerns with public health recommendations met with a quick, often derisive response. It's easy to see why. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"Not every vaccine is created equal,\" Christie said, \"and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others.\" In short order, that comment was contrasted with Christie's forceful response to a possible Ebola case in his state. In that case, Christie mandated that Kaci Hickox be quarantined against her will -- suggesting that Christie feels that Ebola is a greater public health threat than the measles. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In West Africa, that's been true. In the United States, it has not, by a wide margin. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control, there were four cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States last year. In contrast, there were 644 cases of measles. This year, a measles outbreak at Disneyland has pushed the number of cases in the country up quickly -- but no one else has contracted Ebola. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We've noted that one of the Ebola cases diagnosed in the U.S. died -- the first man to receive the diagnosis. Measles is less deadly than Ebola, but still deadly. In about two of 1,000 cases among children, the patient dies. Others suffer from less severe complications. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But the most salient comparison between the two is that measles, unlike Ebola, can largely be prevented through the use of vaccinations. Ebola transmissions can be kept in check through quarantines, yes, but measles was eradicated in the United States in 2000 thanks to the use of vaccinations and education programs. Now, in part thanks to parents opting to ignore public health advice, it's back. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Update:_ A spokesperson for Christie issued a statement stating, in part, that \"with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We've also updated the graphic to include data from the last three days of January. **RELATED** : **\u2018Get your kids vaccinated,\u2019 Obama tells parents doubting \u2018indisputable\u2019 science** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Amid growing vaccination debate, measles continues to spread and is now in New York state** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **The Disneyland measles outbreak and the disgraced doctor who whipped up vaccination fear** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Anti-vaccine doctor revels in his notoriety** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Why this baby\u2019s mom is so angry at the anti-vaxxers** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: California officials warn against \u2018measles parties\u2019 Content: In a warning issued yesterday, the California Department of Health seemed to state the obvious: \u201cCDPH strongly recommends against the intentional exposure of children to measles,\u201d the agency said. \u201cIt unnecessarily places the exposed children at potentially grave risk and could contribute to further spread.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But the words of caution may not have been obvious to everyone. The warning came after San Francisco radio station KQED reported a local woman offered to connect a mother of two unvaccinated children with someone who had the measles. The mother declined the offer and, to date, there is no evidence of anyone holding what the California media is calling a \u201cmeasles party.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cThe basic notion is \u2018This is my opportunity for my kid to get immune the old-fashioned way, the way God intended,\u2019 \u201d epidemiologist Art Reingold of the University of California at Berkeley told KQED. Aside from the KQED report, California officials say they haven\u2019t heard of other instances of intentional exposure to measles, though a local public health officer did tell the Los Angeles Times his office received several inquiries about the benefits of \u201cnatural immunity,\u201d rather than immunity from a vaccine. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But if parents are considering a deliberate attempt to infect their children with the disease, it would not be the first time. Before the introduction of the chicken pox vaccine in 1995, it was common for parents to host \u201cchicken pox parties\u201d when one of their children fell ill. The theory was that it was better for kids to get sick and get it over with, rather than waiting for the disease to come later in life. But the practice didn\u2019t die out with the invention of a vaccine. Instead, families who declined the vaccine continued to try to immunize their kid \u201cin the wild.\u201d A 2004 story in \u201cMothering,\u201d a magazine that promotes \u201cnatural family living,\u201d described one such party as \u201cjubilant.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cSharing sippy cups, whistles, and lollipops (sugar- and saccharine-free, of course), the wee revelers romped and stomped and ran amok as microscopic varicella viruses triggered the alarms of their mucous membranes, manufacturing ideal antibodies for a lifetime of immunity,\u201d the story read. \u201cWe at the party were doing what we felt was safest, after weeding through the propaganda and rhetoric about America \u2018s latest \u2018Red Scare\u2019: the deadly scourge of chickenpox panic.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The strategy was popularized again during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, when the New York Times reported bloggers and even some doctors were weighing the benefits of self-infection. Inspired by a history of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic \u2014 mild in a first wave and more deadly during the fall and winter \u2014 it seemed logical, if risky, to attempt to contract the disease\u2019s milder strain. But most flu experts panned the idea. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cI think it\u2019s totally nuts,\u201d said Anne Moscona, a flu specialist at Cornell University\u2019s Weill Medical College. \u201cThis is like the Middle Ages, when people deliberately infected themselves with smallpox. It\u2019s vigilante vaccination \u2014 you know, taking immunity into your own hands.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Soon, self-infection took to social media. In 2011, posts appeared on Facebook advertising mail-order lollipops infected with the chickenpox virus. That start-up was swiftly shut down by law enforcement \u2014 intentionally mailing infected items is a federal crime. Meanwhile, \u201cpox party\u201d groups have popped up on Facebook and local listservs. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Chickenpox is typically a mild illness, particularly for those who contract it while they\u2019re young, so most deliberate infections are unlikely to go awry. But measles is another matter entirely. The disease hasn\u2019t been endemic in the United States since the 1990s, so good data is hard to come by, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 28 percent of cases in children under 5 resulted in hospitalization between 2001 and 2013.

Content: It was the kind of news that went viral in a skinny minute, because it confirmed almost everybody\u2019s worst fears: A drone had struck a British Airways plane Sunday as it approached London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. That\u2019s what the pilot of the Airbus A320 reported he thought had happened, and the rest of the world took his word as gospel. It even entered into the debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate this week, as an argument was made for increased regulation of drones. But a new possibility was aloft by Thursday: The object may have been no more than a plastic shopping bag. British Transport Minister Robert Goodwill told the House of Lords on Thursday that the investigation into just what the plane struck at an altitude of about 1,700 feet was open to question. \u201cThe reported drone strike on Sunday has not been confirmed it was actually a drone,\u201d Goodwill said. \u201cIt was the local police force that tweeted that they had a report of a drone striking an aircraft. \u201cAnd indeed the early reports of a dent in the front of the plane were not confirmed: There was no actual damage to the plane, and there\u2019s indeed some speculation that it may have even been a plastic bag or something,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve not actually landed a 747 at Heathrow, but I\u2019ve landed the simulator, and the pilot has a lot of other things to concentrate on. So we\u2019re not quite sure what they saw, so I think we should maybe not overreact too much.\u201d In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration said there were 764 drones sighted near airplanes last year, despite current guidelines against flying drones near planes or within five miles of an airport unless the control tower has been contacted first.

Kennedy International Airport. \u201cWe face many difficult challenges as we integrate rapidly evolving [drone] technology into our complex and highly regulated airspace,\u201d said Marke Gibson, FAA senior adviser on UAS Integration. \u201cThis effort at JFK reflects everyone\u2019s commitment to safety.\u201d The FAA said there were 764 drones sighted near airplanes last year, despite guidelines prohibiting flying drones near planes or within five miles of an airport unless the control tower has been contacted first. Drones also are supposed to fly below 400 feet, stay away from stadiums and remain in sight of the operator. (A report that a British Airways plane had been struck by a drone on approach to London\u2019s Heathrow Airport was later discounted.) The FAA began evaluating a drone detection system being used by the FBI this month. The tests at JFK examined the ability of the system to identify five types of drones, including common rotorcraft and more advanced fixed-wing drones. \u201cWe applaud the FBI and FAA for their efforts to detect and track unmanned aerial systems\u201d (or UAS), said Thomas Bosco, the aviation director for the Port Authority of New York. \u201cWe look forward to supporting continued U.S. government efforts to identify and deploy countermeasures to neutralize the threat posed by rogue UASs.\u201d There has been virtual consensus in Congress that steps must be taken to prevent drone-airplane collisions. \u201cUnless more is done, it\u2019s not if an accident will happen, it\u2019s when,\u201d Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) said at a hearing of the House subcommittee on aviation last year. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what happens when you suck a quadcopter [drone] into a jet engine,\u201d said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), who pointed out that a four-pound bird hits a jet moving at 260 mph with the force of 12 tons. The FAA last year released proposed regulations for drones weighing less than 55 pounds. They require that the devices remain within the operator\u2019s line of sight, cannot operate above anyone not involved with drone operation, can be used only during daylight hours, must yield the right of way to other aircraft, cannot move faster than 100 mph or above 500 feet, and that an operator must contact air traffic controllers if operating in airspace they control. It is estimated that 700,000 drones were sold in the United States last year.", "Title: Phoenix flight?

British Airways has decided to dust the charcoal off the London-bound Boeing 777-200 that caught fire in Las Vegas last September and put the plane back into service, a British media report says. The London Evening Standard, quoting the airline, says repairs will be done to the same standards as if the aircraft were \u201cbrand new.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The aircraft\u2019s potentially deadly fire occurred when the British Airways jet was taxiing into position for takeoff from McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on Sept. 8. An engine caught fire, sending up volcanic amounts of smoke and forcing all 159 passengers and 13 crew members to evacuate. No one was seriously injured. The close call was enough for British Airways pilot Chris Henkey to talk of hanging up his wings.

Since June 1, commercial airlines, private pilots and air-traffic controllers have alerted the FAA to 25 episodes in which small drones came within a few seconds or a few feet of crashing into much larger aircraft, the records show. Many of the close calls occurred during takeoffs and landings at the nation\u2019s busiest airports, presenting a new threat to aviation safety after decades of steady improvement in air travel. _**(Related: Close encounters on rise as small drones gain in popularity) ** _ Many of the previously unreported incident reports \u2014 released Wednesday by the FAA in response to long-standing public-records requests from The Washington Post and other news organizations \u2014 occurred near New York and Washington. The FAA data indicates that drones are posing a much greater hazard to air traffic than previously recognized. Until Wednesday, the FAA had publicly disclosed only one other near-collision between a drone and a passenger aircraft: a March 22 incident involving a US Airways regional airliner near Tallahassee, Fla. The newly released incident reports, however, reveal that the FAA has been receiving a steady stream of near-miss alerts from airliners and private pilots since then. On Sept. 30, air-traffic controllers at LaGuardia Airport in New York reported that Republic Airlines Flight 6230 was \u201calmost hit\u201d by a brightly colored small drone at an altitude of 4,000 feet as the passenger plane was descending to land. On Sept. 8 at LaGuardia, three different regional airliners \u2014 Express Jet, Pinnacle and Chautauqua \u2014 reported \u201cvery close calls\u201d with a drone within minutes of one another at an altitude of about 2,000 feet as they were preparing to land. On July 29, a US Airways shuttle flight that had departed from Reagan National Airport reported an extraordinarily narrow encounter with a yellow drone with a four-foot wingspan that suddenly passed within 50 feet of the aircraft while it was approaching LaGuardia. Outside Washington, Porter Airlines Flight 725 from Toronto was descending to Dulles International Airport at an altitude of 2,800 feet on June 29 when it reported that a black-and-silver drone zipped past, just 50 feet away. On June 1, a United Airlines flight originating from Rome alerted the control tower at Dulles that a four-engine helicopter drone interfered with its descent and passed just 100 feet underneath the Boeing 767. The 25 near-midair collisions were among more than 175 incidents in which pilots and air-traffic controllers have reported seeing drones near airports or in restricted airspace since June. Pilots described most of the rogue drones as small, camera-equipped models that have become increasingly popular with hobbyists and photographers. Although such drones often measure only a few feet in diameter and weigh less than 10 pounds, aviation safety experts say they could easily trigger an accident by striking another plane\u2019s propeller or getting sucked into a jet engine. \u201cThe potential for catastrophic damage is certainly there,\u201d said Fred Roggero, a retired Air Force major general who was in charge of aviation safety investigations for the service and now serves as a consultant to companies seeking to fly drones commercially. The reported increase in dangerous encounters comes as the FAA is facing pressure from federal lawmakers and drone manufacturers to move more quickly to open the skies to remotely controlled aircraft. Under a 2012 law, Congress ordered the FAA to safely integrate drones into the national airspace. The FAA is still developing regulations to make that happen, a process that is expected to take years. Under FAA guidelines, it is legal for hobbyists to fly small drones for recreational purposes, as long as they keep them under 400 feet, at least five miles away from airports and outside other restricted areas. Flying drones for commercial purposes is largely prohibited, although the FAA has begun to issue special permits to filmmakers and other industries to operate drones on a case-by-case basis until the agency can adopt a final set of safety regulations. The FAA, however, is struggling to keep up with an influx of cheap drones that have flooded the market. According to some estimates, half a million small drones have been sold in the United States in the past three years. The aviation-safety agency lacks the manpower to police airports or effectively track down offenders. Only a handful of rogue drone operators have been apprehended or penalized across the country. In a statement, the FAA acknowledged that it is now receiving about 25 reports a month from pilots who have spotted drones flying in restricted airspace or in close proximity to other aircraft. \u201cIn partnership with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, the FAA has identified unsafe and unauthorized [drone] operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws,\u201d the agency said. Previously, the only other occasion in which the FAA has released data on drone sightings near airports came in June, when The Post reported that the agency had received a total of 15 reports of risky encounters over a period of two years \u2014 or an average of fewer than one incident a month. Asked why there had been such a large increase in reports since then, the FAA said in a statement Wednesday that the difference could be \u201cattributed to increased awareness by pilots and the public and improved reporting and record-keeping processes.\u201d Manufacturers and businesses that want to fly drones \u2014 including real estate agents, delivery firms, photographers and farmers \u2014 have criticized the FAA for moving too slowly to develop rules of the sky for using the new technology. They say the absence of clear regulations for certifying drone pilots and aircraft has contributed to a rise in reckless behavior by untrained drone enthusiasts. \u201cThe reality here is that we need to have rules,\u201d said Michael Drobac, executive director of the Small UAV Coalition, a lobbying group for firms that make drones or want to integrate them into their business operations. He said \u201csophisticated companies\u201d are largely prohibited from flying drones but that hobbyists can operate them without oversight. Among the companies that are part of the Small UAV Coalition is Amazon.com, which wants to use autonomous drones to deliver small packages to customers\u2019 doorsteps. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Post.) Rapid advances in technology have made small drones affordable and easy for people to fly right out of the box. Some models cost less than $500. Most come with powerful miniature cameras that can film striking video scenes while hovering over back yards, stadiums, city centers and other places previously beyond the reach of amateur photographers. R. Lee Morris, a professional photographer in Charleston, S.C., said he began flying a small DJI Phantom drone with a GoPro camera last year and was \u201cblown away\u201d by its capabilities. \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible thing to have fun with.\u201d In a blog post in March, he wrote that he wanted to see how high the Phantom could fly so he tested it over the skies in a populated area in Charleston. He estimated that the Phantom rose to about 1,000 feet \u2014 more than twice as high as the FAA guidelines for hobbyists \u2014 and acknowledged that it could have caused problems for rescue helicopters or low-flying aircraft. In an interview, Morris said he felt a little guilty afterward and removed videos of the flight from his Web site because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to set a bad example.\u201d But he added that he wasn\u2019t convinced that flying a small drone like a Phantom posed an aviation hazard. He said a pilot friend told him that if the drone struck another plane\u2019s propeller, the remotely controlled aircraft \u201cwould just explode into a million pieces.\u201d Several pilots who reported dangerous encounters with drones to the FAA disagreed strenuously, telling The Post in interviews that the tiny aircraft can pose a menace to air safety. Drones are not equipped with transponders to broadcast their locations in the sky, and most models are too small to show up on radar or anti-collision warning systems. By the time they become visible at high altitudes, pilots said, it is usually too late to change course. \u201cAll it\u2019s going to take is for one to come through a windshield to hurt some people or kill someone,\u201d said Kyle Fortune, who was flying a four-seat Cirrus SR-22 near Medford, Ore., on Sept. 22, when he said a drone about four feet in diameter suddenly appeared 100 feet underneath his plane. He was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet \u2014 about 10 times higher than the FAA\u2019s height restrictions for small drones. \u201cIt was some idiot out there with a drone. I have no idea what he was doing up there, taking pictures or whatnot,\u201d Fortune said. \u201cIf it had come through the cockpit it wouldn\u2019t have been a good day.\u201d Mike Gilbert, chief flight instructor at Aviation Adventures, a flight school based in Manassas, Va., was flying a Cessna with a student and another passenger about 9:45 p.m. on Sept. 17 when a small drone with two red lights suddenly appeared about 200 feet overhead. \u201cIt came seemingly out of nowhere,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cAs pilots, at a minimum it\u2019s distracting. If one of them hits us, we\u2019re coming down. We\u2019re trained to deal with dead engines, but we\u2019re afraid it\u2019s going to hit a [propeller], which would be a disaster, or the airframe.\u201d Several other near-collisions have been reported by pilots of rescue helicopters used to transport patients needing emergency medical attention. A Life Flight helicopter in Pottsville, Pa., reported Nov. 19 that it was descending at 2,400 feet when a flight nurse in the co-pilot seat suddenly yelled: \u201cWatch out!\u201d A small drone was flying straight toward the rescue helicopter \u201cat a high rate of closure,\u201d according to a report that the crew said it filed with the FAA. The pilot was forced to make a sharp banking turn to the right to avoid a collision, according to the report. The crew estimated that the drone passed with about 50 to 100 feet of separation. Greg Lynskey, government relations manager for the Association of Air Medical Services, said small drones were becoming a major concern for rescue helicopter crews around the country. He said the FAA guidelines that allow hobbyists to fly drones as long as they stay five miles away from airports are too lax and do little to protect helicopters that fly near hospitals or pick up patients at accident scenes on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m hoping this can get worked out before we have a catastrophic incident,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take much to bring down a helicopter. If a drone hits the tail rotor, that\u2019d pretty much be it.\u201d Concerned about the potential for trouble, drone manufacturers have begun to add software upgrades to their drone operating systems to prevent them from flying near airports or above a certain altitude. DJI, the Chinese firm that makes the popular Phantom model, now programs its drones so that they cannot take off within 1.5 miles of a major airport and must stay below 400 feet within a five-mile radius of the installation. The default height limit in other areas is programmed at 400 feet, although owners can bypass that ceiling by downloading a software application that comes with safety warnings. \u201cWe did start noticing one of the challenges, or opportunities, we have is to program basic safe-flying practices into the firmware,\u201d said Michael Perry, a DJI spokesman. \u201cWe all want to see this technology safely integrated into the airspace.\u201d", "Title: British Airways passengers fled a burning plane with luggage.

Instead of running for their lives, passengers did something that is unconscionable in the eyes of flight attendants: They grabbed their bags. _[\u2018I\u2019m finished flying,\u2019 British Airways hero pilot says after Las Vegas fire]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And not just the purses beneath their seats (though, you should leave those too). Some people could be clearly seen evacuating the plane carrying roller suitcases that had been retrieved from the compartments overhead. The danger is obvious, say flight attendants. With a plane on fire \u2014 or, really, in any emergency situation \u2014 flight attendants are trained to help passengers evacuate as quickly as possible. Specifically, they want to clear the plane within 90 seconds. That\u2019s impossible if even a few people on a full plane stop to grab their bags. An engine fire is particularly dangerous. Luckily, British Airways Flight 2276 was far from full, allowing passengers to evacuate more quickly. And the fire never pierced the fuel tank or the cabin. But it easily could have been worse. _[Quick action averts disaster as flames and smoke engulf London-bound jetliner]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cAbsolutely selfish and pathetic,\u201d commented one flight attendant who was not authorized by his airline to be quoted. \u201cYou are hindering the person on the window side from quickly evacuating. And what if they panicked and trampled you to death? \u201cLeave it! Not worth your life, it can be replaced.\u201d The fears go beyond just the time it takes for people to evacuate if they are also, perplexingly, trying to bring their bags with them. What if their purse strap gets caught on the arm rest? Or the roller board suitcase punctures the massive plastic slide that is virtually the only hope of getting to safety? And finally, flight attendants are understandably concerned about their own safety. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico They undergo mandatory training on how to help passengers save their own lives should something go wrong on an airplane. They and the pilots are also required to be the last people to exit the plane in an emergency. Evacuating a plane in 90 seconds isn\u2019t just a matter of pride for those who are able to accomplish it; it\u2019s a matter of life or death. According to Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants, passengers should heed the commands of flight attendants during an emergency \u2014 and leave their bags on the plane. \u201cWe expect the [National Transportation Safety Board] investigation will show that the bags slowed the evacuation and may even have caused some of the injuries,\u201d Nelson said in a statement. In the case of the fateful Flight 2276, all passengers and crew survived. But according to the Associated Press, 27 people were hospitalized with minor injuries \u2014 including all 13 members of the flight crew. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage directly addresses the query, discussing the incident where a British Airways plane was reported to have been hit by a drone.

The quest for lower taxes does not define Republicanism until the 1980s, and matters of faith play almost no role in the GOP\u2019s plank until the 1990s. The Republican Party, viewed through its quadrennial platform documents, is consistently business-oriented and committed to a strong defense, but has morphed over the past half- century from a socially moderate, environmentally progressive and fiscally cautious group to a conservative party that is suspicious of government, allied against abortion and motivated by faith. Influenced by the rise of tea party activists, this year\u2019s platform, adopted Tuesday at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, has shifted to the right, particularly on fiscal issues. It calls for an audit of the Federal Reserve and a commission to study returning to the gold standard. There are odes of fidelity to the Constitution but also calls for amendments that would balance the federal budget, require a two-thirds majority in Congress to raise taxes and define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. The new plank urges the transformation of Medicare from an entitlement to a system of personal accounts, increased use of coal for energy and a ban on federal funding to universities that give illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates. House Speaker John A. Boehner (Ohio) expressed skepticism that the lengthy recitation of the party\u2019s positions has much meaning or function. \u201cAnybody read the party platform? I never met anybody,\u201d Boehner told reporters. He said the document should be no more than one page. \u201cThat way, Americans could actually read it.\u201d Party platforms are not easy to digest. They are the meat missing from a campaign menu dominated by sweet and sour TV commercials. Platforms are aspirational laundry lists, packed with sops to every interest group that makes up a modern party. But in retrospect, they provide a good guide to where a party is heading. What it means to be a Republican has changed enormously over the past half-century. The GOP opposed a Palestinian state as late as 1992, went silent on the issue for eight years, then endorsed the idea in its past two planks. During the George H.W. Bush presidency, Republicans acknowledged global warming and boasted of efforts to commit billions of federal dollars to finding solutions. The party then spent two election cycles saying there was too much \u201cscientific uncertainty\u201d before accepting in 2008 that humans have a role in altering the climate. The GOP, like its opposition, has responded to ideological, demographic and social changes by hardening some of its positions and adopting entirely new planks, all part of an effort to create a coalition capable of winning national elections. In the Republicans\u2019 case, that meant adapting and appealing to a new base in the South from the 1970s forward, becoming the dominant party of white suburbia, and finding ways to marry its traditional pro-business foundation with less affluent, more socially conservative voters. Many positions Republicans often tout as traditionally conservative are actually relatively new to GOP ideology. Indeed, although the party\u2019s stance on the issues has shifted rightward over the past 20 years, Republicans have studiously avoided using the word \u201cconservative\u201d in platforms. For decades, the party presented itself as \u201cmoderate\u201d or even \u201cprogressive.\u201d The 1960 plank, for example, touts \u201cprogressive Republican policies\u201d such as \u201cliberal pay\u201d and says the government \u201cmust be truly progressive as an employer.\u201d In 1972, the platform celebrates Republicans\u2019 use of wage and price controls to curb inflation, a doubling of federal spending on manpower training, and a tripling of help to minorities. Even the party\u2019s most conservative platforms avoid that word, which first appears in 1992. From the 1960s to 2008, platforms liberally criticize \u201cliberals,\u201d but \u201cconservative\u201d is used almost exclusively to refer to judges. From the 1960s through the \u201980s, each plank reads like a snapshot of its time, capturing the frustrations of the party or the pride of those in power, sometimes wryly needling Democrats, other years slamming them hard. But from the 1990s forward, the platforms exhibit a sameness of rhetorical style, a reflection of the cut-and-paste reality of the computer age, in which entire sentences appear over and over in successive planks. Even as ritual expressions of solidarity with the Philippines or calls to abolish inheritance taxes survive each round of platform construction, the party line changes markedly on many issues. For decades, Republicans emphasize federal funding for public transit. Then, in 1980, a turn: \u201cRepublicans reject the elitist notion that Americans must be forced out of their cars. Instead, we vigorously support the right of personal mobility and freedom as exemplified by the automobile.\u201d Throughout the 1960s and \u201970s, the GOP platform includes vigorous support for an equal-rights amendment to protect women. Then, in 1980, the party stalemates: \u201cWe acknowledge the legitimate efforts of those who support or oppose ratification.\u201d In the 1960s and \u201970s, the party positions itself as a strong advocate for D.C. voting rights, in the Senate as well as the House. Then, in 1980, all mention of voting rights vanishes; the subject has not appeared since. The first appearance of the abortion issue represents a party very much split between business-oriented moderates and religious conservatives: Abortion \u201cis undoubtedly a moral and personal issue\u201d on which Republicans disagree, the 1976 plank says. Four years later, the issue has been settled: The GOP seeks a constitutional amendment protecting \u201cthe right to life for unborn children.\u201d By 1992, the platform includes a call to appoint judges who oppose abortion. Words such as \u201cfaith\u201d and \u201cheritage\u201d rarely appear until the 1980s. (In 2000, religion plays an even larger role in the platform as the party goes beyond supporting prayer in public schools by seeking to allow them to post the Ten Commandments.) The 1960 plank calls for government workers to receive \u201csalaries which are comparable to those offered by private employers.\u201d In 1984, public-sector workers are redubbed \u201cbureaucrats\u201d and \u201cWashington\u2019s governing elite,\u201d and are blamed for \u201can epidemic of crime, a massive increase in dependency and the slumming of our cities.\u201d Republicans pledge a major cut in the government workforce. The watershed platform of 1980 introduces tax cuts and an increasingly critical attitude toward government. \u201cThe Republican Party declares war on government overregulation,\u201d it says. Antipathy toward high taxes strengthens, resulting in 1992 in an explanation of how lowering taxes on the wealthy would lead to job creation, adding a simple declaration: \u201cWe will oppose any attempt to increase taxes.\u201d The platforms of 1980 and 1992 are the party\u2019s big pivots, both in positions and rhetoric. But the roots of today\u2019s Republicanism become clear during the 1964 conservative uprising that led to Barry Goldwater\u2019s presidential nomination. In 1960, Republicans give \u201cfirm support\u201d to \u201cthe union shop and other forms of union security\u201d and say that \u201cRepublican conscience and Republican policy require that the annual number of immigrants we accept be at least doubled.\u201d Four years later, the GOP bashes Democrats for being \u201cfederal extremists\u201d wedded to an ever more intrusive central government. (Calls to limit benefits for illegal immigrants and deny citizenship to U.S.- born children whose parents arrived here illegally enter the platform in 1996.) The optimism of 1960 \u2014 brimming with hope about new nations, weapons and ideas \u2014 gives way four years later to worry about \u201cmoral decline and drift\u201d born of \u201cindifference to national ideals rounded in devoutly held religious faith.\u201d Suddenly, faith is at the core of Republicanism: The 1960 plank says nothing about religion; four years later, \u201cfaith\u201d is one of the most frequently used words, along with \u201cheritage\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d In 1960, the platform calls for \u201cvigorous support of court orders for school desegregation\u201d and affirms the rights of civil rights protesters. The 1964 plank calls for \u201cdiscouraging lawlessness and violence\u201d and \u201copposing federally sponsored \u2018inverse discrimination.\u2019 \u201d The shift in substance comes with a notable pivot in tone. From the 1960 platform: \u201cWe have no wish to exaggerate differences between ourselves and the Democratic Party.\u201d Four years later: \u201cLet the Democratic Party stand accused.\u201d On foreign policy, Republicans remain mostly consistent, calling for increased defense spending to combat communism. But the 1964 plank foreshadows the skepticism about the United Nations that would become a GOP mainstay from the 1990s forward. In 1960, the party pledges to \u201csupport and strengthen the U.N.\u201d Four years later, it warns that \u201cRepublicans will never surrender to any international group the responsibility of the United States for its sovereignty.\u201d If the fiery rhetoric of 1964 presaged the Reagan and tea party revolutions, the path was not smooth. The Richard M. Nixon years brought a return \u2014 in the platform, if not in the coarser approach revealed in the Nixon White House tapes \u2014 of a more moderate message. The 1968 platform would strike many voters today as a Democratic agenda \u2014 addressing air and water pollution, crowded slums, and discrimination against minorities, all with \u201ca new mix of private responsibility and public participation in the solution of social problems.\u201d The \u201968 plank also proposes to expand Social Security by lowering the age for universal coverage from 72 to 65. Future platforms remain supportive of maintaining benefits until 2004, when the party endorses George W. Bush\u2019s proposal to shift to personal retirement accounts. But amid that progressive Republicanism, the roots of the culture wars to come poke through the soil. The \u201972 platform opposes quotas to achieve racial balance in college admissions and hiring, and rails against liberal hegemony on campuses. (That theme remains through 2008, when the platform says that \u201cleftist dogmatism dominates many institutions.\u201d) By 1992, \u201cfamily values\u201d become a major theme. The platform states that \u201cthe media, the entertainment industry, academia and the Democrat Party are waging a guerrilla war against American values.\u201d (That abbreviated version of the other party\u2019s name, without the \u201c-ic\u201d suffix, appears for the first time in 1976, an early sign of the sniping that has come to dominate interparty rhetoric.) The \u201992 plank, the first to mention same-sex relationships, rejects any recognition of gay marriage or allowing same-sex couples to adopt children or become foster parents. The stand against adoption and foster care does not reappear. The passage about marriage grows longer and more strident every four years, culminating in the 2004 call, echoed in 2008, for the amendment defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. From 1996 through 2008, Republicans repeat that \u201chomosexuality is incompatible with military service.\u201d The GOP also evolves on campaign finance. In 1992, it calls for reforms that include the elimination of \u201cpolitical action committees supported by corporations, unions or trade associations.\u201d By 2000, that position morphs into one championing \u201cthe right of every individual and all groups to express their opinions and advocate their issues\u201d \u2014 a veiled reference to efforts to eliminate limits on campaign contributions. And the party\u2019s attitude on the balance between civil liberties and aggressive security measures shifts dramatically after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The 1996 and 2000 platforms oppose President Bill Clinton\u2019s decision to close Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, promising to reopen the street. But later platforms embrace George W. Bush\u2019s emphasis on the vigorous expansion of the government\u2019s role in homeland security.", "Title: In the District, a same-sex couple\u2019s adoption success story Content: This is a story about judgments and the many ways people can surprise us. It begins a couple of years ago, when I was covering a conference for gay and lesbian parents. I met a gorgeous couple who looked more like models in a a Polo ad than parents. \u201cDo you have kids?\u201d I asked, dubious because, really, no one looks that good when they have children. \u201cNo, but we\u2019re interested in adopting. Or maybe becoming foster parents,\u201d Kelly Vielmo told me. Foster parents? I wondered what, exactly, these two impeccably groomed men thought foster parenting \u2014 any parenting \u2014 was like. We said goodbye, and I moved on to other interviews. Two months later, I saw an interesting post online on a parenting discussion group. \u201cThis morning on the Metro two different people whispered to me that I needed to get my foster daughter\u2019s African American hair maintained. (She is 5 1 / 2 years old.),\u201d wrote Kelly, one of the glamo-guys I met at the conference. \u201cCan anyone on this listserv offer suggestions as to where we can go?\u201d Whoa. They did it. He and his partner, Jack Montgomery, became foster parents. And I regretted being so dismissive of them. A year or so later, I got an e-mail from them, inviting me to their wedding. And right before they tied the knot, they were planning on finalizing the adoption of three children, ages 2, 3 and 6. _Read Montgomery\u2019s wedding toast: To family _ Double, wait, triple whoa. They did it! They had an adoption ceremony in a D.C. courtroom, with about 40 people attending. The girls, Raine and Ravyn, were in matching dresses, and Cardel was dressed up, clip-on tie in place. Their priest came to bless the ceremony. After it was all done, the judge stepped down and hugged everyone. I\u2019d already been to their Capitol Hill townhouse to meet the kids. The living room was filled with games, puzzles, desks and books. The kids spilled out of Kelly\u2019s car; he had picked them up from camp, and Jack was home making tortellini, chicken and broccoli. The dinner hour with three small children was remarkable for its calm. Jack was honest: \u201cWell, a year ago, someone would\u2019ve been on the floor crying.\u201d \u201cMaybe one of us,\u201d Kelly shticked. What\u2019s a family without some tears? Forming their family wasn\u2019t easy. The older siblings, Raine and Cardel, came first. A social worker said the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency was looking for a \u201cforever home\u201d for them, not someone who would keep them for a few months, then pass them along to the next foster home. Eventually, the children were joined by their youngest sibling, tiny Ravyn, who was 18 months old and barely walking. All of them had developmental issues stemming from the neglect in their biological family\u2019s home. Cardel was 5 but hardly talking. Raine was a blur, manic and nearly uncontrollable. Jack, 34, was raised in South Carolina, in a big Southern family, and always wanted to have kids. When he and Kelly, 35, hit their 10th anniversary, he knew it was time to get serious about adoption. Most of their same-sex-couple friends had gone abroad for expensive international adoptions; that seemed to be the thing to do. Then Jack and Kelly attended the Rainbow Families conference and heard a representative from CFSA describe the District\u2019s foster children. There are almost 2,000 children in foster care right here in our city, and nearly 400 of them are waiting for a home. The city has long been open to adoptions and foster care by same-sex couples, said Mindy Good, spokeswoman for CFSA. Between January 2011 and April 2012, the agency licensed 17 foster homes where the parent or parents self-identified as gay or lesbian, she said. So Jack and Kelly became foster parents, hoping to adopt. They had a couple of temporary kids, grew attached to them and kept their photos after they were returned to their parents. Last year, their forever children arrived, and they began meeting the challenge of caring for them. \u201cThey were a fantastic family from the beginning, very quick to advocate for their children,\u201d said Kathleen Ambroso, the CFSA social worker who handled Jack and Kelly\u2019s case. \u201cAnd that was it. They saw them as their children, right from the start.\u201d What really seemed to bond them was the addition of their sister, Ravyn, who had been cared for in a foster home in another state. When she joined them, everyone fell into their roles, Ambroso said. Cardel became the smart older brother, taking on a leadership role, bringing Ravyn along with games and patience, his own vocabulary increasing as he taught her. And Raine and Ravyn were inseparable, reveling in their girliness. When I arrived at their home, they spent much of the time asking to see my eye shadow and applying lipstick to my face with less-than-perfect accuracy. It wasn\u2019t smooth, Jack reminds me. In their parent-support groups and foster meetings, they were usually the only same-sex parents. The first time their home was inspected to qualify for foster care, the social worker looked them up and down with wonder and a hint of suspicion. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to a home in this part of town,\u201d she told them. The adoption process was painful at times, especially for the children\u2019s mother. She was struggling and in lots of legal trouble. Raising three children was untenable in her situation, and she knew it. But they were her babies. And Jack and Kelly knew it. Aware of the racial, social and economic differences that were part of the situation, the men tread carefully. In the end, after social workers and therapists and teachers and psychologists and pediatricians had been studying them for a year, a judge determined that the best place for the children to thrive was with Jack and Kelly. To help the mom stay in touch, they set up a personal blog, just for her, where they post photos and drawings and anecdotes from their lives. The biggest challenge came with Cardel\u2019s biological father. Before he heard that his child was being adopted, he didn\u2019t play much of a role in Cardel\u2019s life. But the thought of his child being raised by two strangers \u2014 and by two gay, white strangers \u2014 prompted a court fight. It got ugly. On the third day of testimony, Jack, Kelly and Cardel were outside the courthouse early. \u201cCardel was going through a paper airplane phase, so we were playing paper airplanes with him outside,\u201d Jack said. The father came toward them. They had never exchanged a word outside the courtroom. Jack invited him to come play. And for a good 30 minutes, the three men and the boy played and laughed. When they assembled in the courtroom later in the week, Cardel\u2019s biological father took the stand and made an announcement. He looked at Jack and Kelly and said aloud that his son would do well with them, that he was in the right place. He cried a little, got off the stand, hugged everyone, dropped his case and walked out the door. When the social worker showed him the family photo from the wedding, he told her: \u201cCardel will have opportunities I never had.\u201d Judgment dropped, and a family now complete.", "Title: At Capitol, a homecoming for a D.C. foster kid Content: Thomas McRae wore the summer intern\u2019s uniform \u2014 khaki blazer and bright blue bow tie \u2014 as he sat hunched over a computer screen in Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin\u2019s office, typing a policy memo. What set the rising junior at Cheyney University in Pennsylvania apart from the legions of overachieving interns on Capitol Hill this summer were the deficits he had overcome to get there, and where he overcame them \u2014 four miles east of the Capitol on the other side of the Anacostia River in the District\u2019s struggling Lincoln Heights neighborhood. He can recite the dates he entered and left each of 22 homes growing up after he was abandoned by his mother. In one, he suffered a gunshot wound. In another, his foster mother told him that he was lazy and \u201cwould never make it.\u201d She was wrong. McRae, 20, has excelled in a program that brings youths who grew up in foster or adoptive homes together with members of Congress. The goal of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute\u2019s program is to encourage interns to help formulate policy and to educate others on where they\u2019ve come from. McRae chose to pursue an issue more identified with combat veterans than foster children: post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). But as a veteran foster child, it\u2019s something he\u2019s intimately familiar with. \u201cSometimes I look in the mirror and reflect on everything I\u2019ve gone through, and this all just feels like a dream to me,\u201d he said. McRae\u2019s mother abandoned him as a month-old infant and left him with a man she called his father, who was fighting colon cancer. Because of his illness, he put McRae in the homes of acquaintances, 11 in all. Once, in 2004, when McRae was 10, he called his father and asked to be removed from a home because he was afraid he would be shot. The next day, as he lay on the sofa in the living room, the 14-year-old grandson of his caretaker accidentally discharged a shotgun in a bedroom. Pellets burst through the wall and struck McRae in the shoulder and back. He recalled that he made his way off the couch, but he couldn\u2019t move his right shoulder. He crawled toward the nearest person, grabbing the leg of a woman he called Grandma at the time. He said she told one of her grandsons to put him back on the couch and act as if nothing happened. If it weren\u2019t for neighbors who came over when they heard the shot, McRae said, he might not have been taken to the hospital. The shooting got him placed in the District\u2019s foster-care system. But his struggles were far from over. His biological mother was contacted and offered custody of her son. She declined. A DNA test also revealed that the man who McRae thought was his father was in fact no relation. The revelation ended their relationship. \u201cI never saw him again,\u201d McRae said. Two years later, McRae\u2019s attorney told him that the man had died of cancer. \u201cMy dad was my best friend,\u201d he said. \u201cHe tried to raise me the best way he could.\u201d After beginning therapy in foster care, McRae was given a diagnosis of PTSD, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He attributes his PTSD to the night he was hit by the shotgun pellets and still has dreams in which he\u2019s shot. There would be 11 foster homes, bringing more hardship \u2014 and acts of kindness. As a sixth-grader in 2004, McRae met Dawson Hylton. The two soon became best friends. Hylton\u2019s mother, Joi Morris, came to suspect that McRae was living the foster-care shuffle because she always seemed to pick him up at different houses. As the shuffle continued, Morris started taking adoption classes with Child and Family Services, thinking that some day she might adopt McRae. In 2009, he ended up at a group home in Northeast Washington run by Boys Town, a national organization that provides homes and help for foster children and other at-risk youths. His new home wasn\u2019t far from where McRae had been shot years before. \u201cWhen he came in, he had anger issues,\u201d said Hubert Geter, 35, who ran the house with his wife, Chauna. \u201cBut he was very pleasant and mannerable. I kinda wish more of the kids were like him.\u201d This home \u2014 it was his 21st \u2014 was different. For the first time, McRae felt as if he was living in a real home. \u201cThe Geters are my mother and father figure,\u201d he said. \u201cI would give up my life for them.\u201d But the Geters were able to provide only a temporary home, so after a few months, McRae moved again, into what would be his last foster placement. It, too, felt like home. He thought the foster family would adopt him.\u201cI wanted that sort of love like nothing else,\u201d he said. It didn\u2019t happen. McRae called Joi Morris, Hylton\u2019s mom. \u201cCan you adopt me?\u201d he asked. She said yes. \u201cMy initial thought was that I complain about young males in the area not living up to what they should be,\u201d said Morris, a program specialist with the Association of American Colleges. \u201cIf I could make a difference with one person other than my biological son, then that would help.\u201d Ira Lustbader, associate director of Children\u2019s Rights, a nonprofit group that tries to change failing child welfare systems, said there are plenty of success stories among those who outgrow foster care. But there are also thousands who find themselves homeless, jobless or in prison. At the end of 2011, around the time Morris was adopting McRae, 400,540 children were in foster care in the United States, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Only 12 percent of them were adopted that year, and more than 26,000 aged out of the system. On July 31, McRae and 15 other interns with the congressional coalition\u2019s Foster Youth program announced their policy recommendations as Cardin (D-Md.) and other members of the Senate and House listened. McRae, tall and skinny, introduced his fellow interns. Outwardly, he does not lack for confidence. He was voted Mr. Freshman and Mr. Sophomore at Cheyney, which is outside Philadelphia. He is also his dorm\u2019s head resident adviser. He\u2019s majoring in psychology and considers himself a poet. \u201cThese stories are for the youth who have been abused and mistreated . . . and for the youth who are having trouble making it in school,\u201d McRae said. \u201cOur voice is for a brighter future, for the next generation. These are our stories, so please listen.\u201d Presenting his policy proposals, he suggested that Congress require mental health services to be offered as an option for a year for young people who have aged out of the foster system. He also suggested that Medicaid eligibility be extended for former foster youths until the age of 26. In an interview later, McRae said he still feels the burdens of an unstable childhood. He finds it hard to get close to people, though his adoption by Morris has helped, along with having friends at college. McRae relished the Capitol Hill experience, including passing the podium where President Obama has delivered the State of the Union address. He returns regularly to Boys Town, where he shoots hoops with the boys who live there, and stays in touch with the Geters. On Father\u2019s Day, he took Hubert Geter out for lunch. He goes back, he said, because the home changed his life. In the last week of his internship, McRae reflected on the experience. \u201cI was around people I could relate to who were supportive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know what else? D.C. is my city. I promised myself a summer of peace, with no drama, and I got it. And I\u2019m gonna give back to this city. It\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d", "Title: Why is it so expensive to adopt a child? Content: Across the world, there are thousands of children in need of homes. In America, there are thousands of families looking for children to adopt. Sounds like a match made in heaven, right? Until you look at the price tag. Jonathan and Amanda Teixeira of Denver struggled for a couple of years to conceive before deciding to pursue adoption. After talking to friends who had gone through the process, the staggering price seemed insurmountable. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cThere are probably a lot of children who don\u2019t have a home that would have one if it wasn\u2019t for this ridiculously insane high cost.\u201d \u201cThe biggest chunk of adoption fees generally go towards what I would lump together as \u2018legal fees,\u2019 \u201d Gumm said. \u201cJust from the processing of all the legal work that goes into that sort of complicated process. But there\u2019s a lot of variants.\u201d It\u2019s possible to find ways to arrange a private newborn adoption for $6,000 to $8,000. \u201cA lot of it will depend on the specific situation, like if the adoptive family is helping pay for medical expenses,\u201d Gumm said. International adoption often requires couples to travel at least once to the birth country of the child they\u2019re adopting. Sometimes adoptive parents must live in that country for a month or longer. In these cases, travel becomes an additional large cost. In addition, every small legal step along the way \u2014 such as filing for citizenship \u2014 comes with a price tag of a couple hundred dollars. It adds up quickly. The Teixeiras, having already paid off thousands of dollars in school loans, were committed to debt-free living. \u201cDebt puts people in a bad situation. It\u2019s not part of a secure financial life,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cEspecially for adoption. You\u2019re taking on responsibility for another person. So it was important for us to be very financially secure while doing that. The idea of taking on thousands of dollars in debt just didn\u2019t sit right.\u201d The Teixieras work as missionaries in Colorado and were used to fundraising money. So after reading Gumm\u2019s book, they felt inspired to pursue that route as a method to pay for their adoption. They launched a puzzle fundraiser, where participants purchased a puzzle piece for $25. The 1,000-piece puzzle was of a popular Bible verse referencing children, and participants\u2019 names were written on the back of the piece they purchased. \u201cWe wanted to invite people to participate in our adoption with us,\u201d Jonathan said. \u201cThis was one way they could do that.\u201d They adopted their daughter Josephine in 2014 after finding her biological parents on Facebook. In Colorado, to get on an adoption agency\u2019s wait list is expensive, so the Teixieras created a Facebook post and hoped to go viral. They were extremely lucky, and their daughter\u2019s birth mother reached out the day they created their post. Their puzzle fundraiser raised $18,000, which covered the cost of the adoption, as well as travel to and from their daughter\u2019s birth in California. They\u2019ve helped multiple couples create their own puzzles and talked them through the fundraising process. \u201cFundraising\u201d is a scary word for many people. It can put couples in a vulnerable position, and the adoption world is often split into two camps: those who fundraise and those who strongly oppose the practice. \u201cPeople are scared their children will feel like they owe strangers a piece of their life,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a way to talk about it with your child that\u2019s super positive and depicts what it\u2019s really about. I think those are just fears from people who have never fundraised before. We\u2019re not afraid of fundraising.\u201d \u201cWhen people think fundraising, they might cringe or think of GoFundMe pages,\u201d Gumm added. \u201cBut there are a lot of creative ways to raise money, from garage sales to karaoke nights. I know families that have raised $10,000 through garage sales by just asking friends to donate their junk.\u201d Foster care is another path to consider, Gumm said. \u201cAdopting from the U.S. foster care system is generally completely free, or very inexpensive. I always say to families that if it\u2019s just completely cost prohibitive for you to spend a few thousand dollars \u2014 up to much higher than that \u2014 and you still really want to do it, look into adopting from the foster care system,\u201d Gumm said. However, the foster care system also comes with joys and challenges. Adopting babies out of the foster care system is typically difficult, because of a high demand, and children in the foster care system often have very specific emotional and physical needs that some families may not feel equipped to handle. There\u2019s always a way to adopt if that\u2019s what you\u2019re determined to do. It\u2019s just requires finding a way to get your hands on the money, whether it\u2019s through grants, fundraising or simply cutting major corners in your family budget. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Gumm said. \u201cBut if adoption is what you want to do, don\u2019t let cost be the thing that keeps you from doing it.\u201d", "Title: Here\u2019s which states are most innovative in America Content: What makes a state a champion of innovation? Is it the size of its tech workforce, the speed of its broadband connectivity, its willingness to protect and foster new business models? What is the essential mix of state-level policies and practices that make a state a leader in developing new businesses and fostering a more competitive U.S. economy? Innovation is a driving force in job creation and economic growth. More, it offers each of us a path toward a more efficient, enjoyable and productive life. To identify the most innovation-friendly states, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) evaluated and graded the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia on their 2014 pro-innovation policies and milestones, creating the first ever Innovation Scorecard. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico We considered objective metrics \u2013 whether a state has right-to-work laws, its tax friendliness, the speed of its broadband connectivity \u2013 as well as more subjective metrics that get to the heart of a state\u2019s innovation profile. What steps, for example, have state governments taken to expand their appeal to the tech community and foster forward-thinking start-ups, strong talent pools and venture funding? After months of accounting and analysis, 10 states stand out as Innovation Champions \u2013 those top performers at the forefront of innovation and friendly business practices in America. The results may surprise you. Think California would top the list, given its high concentration of tech start-ups? Think again. While California earned one of the highest overall grades for per capita venture capital investment in the U.S., its high corporate taxes and over-burdensome sustainability practices make it a tough state for tech firms to call home. As a result, the home state of Silicon Valley \u2014 as well as global innovators such as Google, Apple and Uber \u2013 earned the title of Innovation Adopter, only the third-highest tier among our four categories. On the other hand, favorable employment laws, tax-friendly policies and strong business sustainability practices earned states such as Utah the top-tier Innovation Champion title. A competitive tax system lets businesses keep more of the money they make, drives job creation and boosts investment in research and development. Utah\u2019s low-tax system has earned the state a new nickname: \u201cSilicon Slopes.\u201d Start-ups that call Utah home include Vivint, Qualtrics and Domo. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Here\u2019s a closer look at some of the more surprising findings in our first-ever Scorecard. **Among the champions** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The highest-achievers in our inaugural Scorecard \u2013 Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia \u2013 are proven leaders in fostering legislative and regulatory climates conducive to innovation. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico As a public accounting of best business practices for growth and innovation at the state level, the Scorecard ranks Virginia, Delaware and D.C. in the top tier for defending the sharing economy. In 2014, the D.C. City Council approved ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft; Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe overturned the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicle\u2019s decision to halt operations of transportation networking companies; and Delaware Gov. Markell publicly supported sharing economy companies such as Airbnb. And D.C. is quickly becoming a start-up darling thanks to its young, highly-educated population and the presence of business incubators such as 1776 that connect start-ups with resources in the metropolitan Washington-area. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Texas\u2019s model electronics-recycling laws build on the voluntary recycling initiatives of the consumer electronics industry, helping it earn the \u201cInnovation Champion\u201d moniker. Texas, which boasts the fastest job-growth rate in the country, also drew high marks in the start-up category: Austin and Dallas were named top cities for start-up funding. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Entrepreneurs looking for a move-in ready environment to launch their next business should consider North Carolina, a right-to-work state with a favorable tax system and more successful business start-ups per capita than most states. More, Catawba Valley Community College, in partnership with the Kauffman Foundation, is running a statewide initiative, Innovation Fund America, to promote tech start-ups. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Signs of modest innovation** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico At the bottom of the list are states that lack the foundation necessary to attract innovators, usually from a combination of poor policy choices, such as Mississippi, which has been aggressive toward tech companies such as Google, and poor tech infrastructure, such as Kentucky, which has marginal broadband connectivity. __ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Our advice to states that didn\u2019t top the list? Follow the lead of these 10 Innovation Champions and actively support entrepreneurs and growing business, particularly tech companies and start-ups. The 2015 Scorecard is our first report; we will continue to monitor the state of innovation in America and update this scorecard as states change their policies, to regularly reflect whether they encourage innovation. American growth and economic prosperity are most vibrant in states with policies and political climates that favor and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude that are woven into the American DNA. Our hope is that states will use the Scorecard\u2019s guideposts to enhance their pro-innovation policies.

That year, the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority was forced to settle a federal lawsuit that claimed it failed for decades to stop its Civil War-vintage sewers from spewing pollution. D.C. Water agreed to build three huge tunnels within 20 years to stop pipes from overflowing during hard rains, sending billions of gallons of storm water mixed with raw sewage into Rock Creek and the Potomac and Anacostia rivers every year. \u201cMaybe . . . before I pass away, I can see children swimming in there,\u201d Robert Boone, the former president of the Anacostia Watershed Society, said shortly after the settlement was reached. But now, the three-tunnel solution is in doubt, and activists, engineers and bureaucrats are arguing once again about the best path to cleaner waters. Although digging is underway for the first tunnel, D.C. Water wants to put the other two on hold and instead see whether rain gardens, retention ponds and grass rooftops can soak up as much storm-water runoff as the pipes can store. D.C. Water has asked the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to build an experimental \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d project and run tests for at least eight years. The green project would be built where the second and third tunnels were slated to run, along Rock Creek Parkway near the Kennedy Center to protect the Potomac River and in Upper Northwest neighborhoods to protect Rock Creek. A 13-mile tunnel under the Anacostia River and deep into the Northeast near a Home Depot off Rhode Island Avenue, currently under construction, would continue as planned. The EPA is considering D.C. Water\u2019s proposed \u201cpartnership agreement,\u201d and a decision on whether to move forward with public hearings on the changes is expected soon. Among local environmental activist groups, a verdict on the request is already clear: Don\u2019t do it. Some are enraged; others have expressed dismay about the proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re well down the road to the tunnel solution, and I\u2019m a little ambivalent about changing course midstream,\u201d said Brent Bolin, a spokesman for the Anacostia Watershed Society. Opponents say that if the green pilot project wins approval, billions of gallons of sewage would pour into the Potomac and Rock Creek for eight years while D.C. Water conducts its tests. The proposed agreement played a major role in the recent firing of the head of the D.C. Department of the Environment (DDOE), Christophe Tulou. He said he believed the green infrastructure project had no hope of performing as well as the utility claimed, and he allowed experts in his department to say as much in comments on the project submitted to the EPA. In a recent interview at his home, Tulou, now unemployed, said his department \u201chad no beef about green infrastructure. But there are still issues one has to resolve . . . how effective is green infrastructure in mitigating storm-water runoff. We don\u2019t know exactly.\u201d But others who support Tulou were more harsh in their criticism, saying green infrastructure is a stall tactic, an attempt to delay a portion of the $2.6 billion cost of the Clean Rivers tunnel project. \u201cFrom our perspective, this proposal is purely about delays . . . that is the purpose behind it,\u201d said Jennifer C. Chavez, a staff attorney for Earthjustice, a nonprofit legal organization that represented several groups in a lawsuit against the utility in 2000. D.C. Water\u2019s general manager, George Hawkins, has said the \u201cgreen\u201d project is superior to the \u201cgray\u201d pipes because it would cool and beautify the city if tests are successful and the program is allowed to expand. Hawkins convinced Mayor Vincent C. Gray (D) of the project\u2019s worthiness early last year. Gray sent two letters of support to EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson in March and July, without consulting experts in his office for their opinions on whether it would work. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) initially favored green infrastructure, but not at the expense of the two tunnels in the original agreement. When Mendelson learned that D.C. Water and city officials were negotiating a partnership agreement, he also wrote a letter to the EPA administrator, withdrawing his support for the green project. Green infrastructure should be included with all three tunnels or be left out altogether, Mendelson wrote. To clean the water, the District needs what D.C. water originally agreed in court to build, not a hybrid of a tunnel for the Anacostia watershed and something else for Rock Creek and the Potomac. According to Tulou, Shawn Garvin of the EPA asked his department to submit comments on D.C. Water\u2019s proposal. Within days, DDOE submitted comments that said the \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d project was vague, lacking information on how the tests would be conducted, who would pay for the upkeep and maintenance of the gardens and a detailed estimate of how much pollution would pour into the rivers and creeks during testing. Gray felt that his support for the project was being upstaged. On the last day of August, Tulou was terminated by City Administrator Allen Lew, who sits on D.C. Water\u2019s board of directors. Lew said DDOE\u2019s criticism represented a \u201cbreach of protocol.\u201d Gray replaced Tulou with Keith A. Anderson, who oversaw sustainable energy and affordable energy plans at DDOE. An official in Gray\u2019s administration, who spoke anonymously because firings are a personnel matter, said Tulou\u2019s problems went beyond his department\u2019s criticism of D.C. Water. The official said he was often unaware of what his staff was doing, and that he was too by the book to understand an experimental project like green infrastructure. That characterization surprised one of Tulou\u2019s former supervisors, Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), who appointed him as secretary of the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control when he was governor of Delaware. \u201cI loved Christophe and did so for 10 years,\u201d said Carper, who served from 1993 until 2001. Carper credited Tulou with successfully drafting rules for development in a sensitive coastal area. \u201cHe was great at it,\u201d Carper said. \u201cHe\u2019s very good at collaborating. His skill at getting us to yes on a complex issue . . . is viewed by me as important.\u201d Tulou\u2019s dismissal stung environmental activists, who now question Gray\u2019s commitment to the environment, particularly in light of recent actions and statements by Lew. After Tulou\u2019s firing, Lew met with his former staff and warned them against making comments to EPA before getting clearance. His talk had a chilling effect, particularly after a report in the Washington Business Journal suggesting that some of its environmental protections overstepped its role. \u201cI do think it would be fair to say the city administrator is taking a look at the agency to ensure that it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to . . . that it\u2019s carrying out its regulatory responsibility but . . . not overstepping its role as regulator and moving into the role of advocate,\u201d Tony Robinson, Lew\u2019s spokesman, was quoted as saying. As far as some environmentalists are concerned, Lew\u2019s talk at DDOE and Robinson\u2019s statement reveal a lack of understanding of the department\u2019s role. \u201cDDOE is the environmental conscience of the District,\u201d said Chavez of Earthjustice. D.C. Water and commercial developers often have much higher priorities than protecting fresh waters. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for DDOE to be there to weigh in on environmental standards, and we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Chavez said.", "Title: D.C. residents debate details of planned 11th Street Bridge Park Content: Active or passive? That was the essential question at two recent citizens\u2019 meetings to discuss plans for the proposed 11th Street Bridge Park. Should it be used mostly for organized activities, or for strolling, viewing and musing? The park would sit atop a new 2.84-acre platform across the Anacostia River, adjacent to the westernmost of the three new 11th Street bridges. The structure would be erected on piers that remain from one of the two bridges replaced by the trio of new crossings. About 50 people gathered for each of the Dec. 7 parleys, one in the morning at a church on the Anacostia side of the river and the other in the afternoon in a city government office building near the Navy Yard. Harriet Tregoning, director of D.C.\u2019s Office of Planning, introduced the second session. \u201cTen years from now, you\u2019ll be able to say . . . \u2018See that part, that was my idea,\u2019 \u201d she said. The idea for the park draws from such projects as New York\u2019s High Line and Paris\u2019s Viaduc des Arts, elevated railway lines that were remade as garden promenades. Neither of those crosses a river, but there are plans for garden bridges that span rivers in Providence, R.I., and London. The latter is projected to open in 2018, about the same time the 11th Street Bridge Park would debut \u2014 if $25 million can be raised for construction and an additional $10 million for an endowment to fund programming. There have been \u201ca little more than 160 community meetings\u201d about the proposal, said Scott Kratz, one of the planning sessions\u2019 organizers. Kratz has been working on the bridge park as a volunteer for two years and will become its paid project manager next month. His imminent employer is Building Bridges Across the River at THE ARC, which is overseeing the park\u2019s development but is better known for its Southeast arts center. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard the same concepts again and again from people on both sides of the river,\u201d Kratz said of the seven elements presented at the meeting. \u201cThis was the first time that we asked the community to rank them.\u201d Most enthusiastically supported at both forums were a performance space, public art, a playground, and a launch for kayaks and canoes. Less support was voiced for a restaurant, an environmental education center and \u201curban agriculture,\u201d which might entail a vegetable garden or a fruit orchard. \u201cWe heard that loud and clear,\u201d Kratz said of the meeting participants\u2019 interest in openness and adaptability. \u201cWe need to make sure that we include quiet spaces for contemplation.\u201d Several locations along the Anacostia, notably Kingman Island, have been suggested as sites for an environmental education center. Kratz said he checked with other groups to ensure such a facility \u201cis not duplicative. The Anacostia River does not need 10 environmental education centers within two miles of each other.\u201d The bridge park would not serve primarily as a way to cross the river, Kratz said. \u201cWe\u2019re building a new deck, and since that deck doesn\u2019t have to be flat anymore, the designers are going to have a real field day with this.\u201d If a streetcar line is built on the adjoining span, he noted, there might be one or more mid-river stops with pedestrian connections to the bridge park. Planning has been funded by about $540,00 in cash and in-kind contributions from real-estate development firms, philanthropists and civic groups, Kratz said. About 20 percent of the money came from the D.C. government, which will remain a partner because it controls the property. \u201cThe District owns the bridge, and it will continue to be owned by the District going forward,\u201d Kratz said. \u201cBut it would be managed by a private entity like a Building Bridges Across the River at THE ARC.\u201d Responsibility for maintaining the finished bridge park hasn\u2019t been determined, he said. At a date Kratz described as \u201cMarch-ish,\u201d a nationwide design competition will be announced for the park. A review committee will winnow the applicants to three, and a jury will pick the winner. Members of the committee and jury have not been chosen.", "Title: U.S. Infrastructure gets D+ in annual report Content: This time they stood in front of a D.C. bridge that will cost $661 million to replace, but the whole point was that they could have used about 10,000 different places in America as their backdrop for an example of something critical that\u2019s falling apart. The report card by the American Society of Civil Engineers showed the national infrastructure a single grade above failure, a step from declining to the point where everyday things simply stop working the way people expect them to. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about infrastructure, we never compute the cost of inaction,\u201d said former Pennsylvania governor Edward G. Rendell, who now heads a coalition that promotes investment in infrastructure. \u201cThe cost of inaction is greater than the cost of doing something. It\u2019s become this literally crazed idea that spending money is bad. Federal governments and state governments have to spend money on certain things that are important.\u201d Using ratings by civil engineers in every state, the ASCE gave the national infrastructure an overall grade of D-plus, an average pulled down by some of the biggest problem areas \u2014 aviation, drinking-water supply, roads, transit and sewage treatment. Restoring it all to good working order will require an investment of $3.6 trillion by 2020, the ASCE concluded, and if the current level of spending continues it will fall short of that figure by $1.6 trillion. The call for vast new investment comes in an era of national austerity, and with a major source of infrastructure funding on the brink of bankruptcy. \u201cThese systems are the foundation. We need a commitment to bring infrastructure into a state of good repair,\u201d said ASCE President Gregory E. DiLoreto, standing by the Anacostia River with the dilapidated Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge looming behind him. \u201cWe need leadership at all levels of government.\u201d Maryland received a rating of C-minus from its civil engineers, scoring best for its restoration of bridges but low for managing storm water that flows into the Chesapeake Bay. Virginia scored a D-plus, with its better grades for parks, aviation and waterways, while it narrowly missed a failing grade for its handling of more than 1,000 dams. While the District did not receive an overall grade, the report noted that 99 percent of its streets were judged in poor or mediocre condition. The experts, joined by an outspoken cadre of former secretaries of transportation and by those who run different parts of the country\u2019s infrastructure, have been sounding the warning for several years now. Their reports and studies all reach the same dire conclusion, but so long as lights come with a flick of the switch, streets are fairly smooth, water flows from the faucet, and trains and planes run mostly on time, their message does not seem to connect with most average Americans. In rating 16 areas of infrastructure, the engineers did find a couple of things to be happy about. With 34 percent of the nation\u2019s trash now being recycled, solid waste management received a grade of B-minus. A $75 billion capital investment in railroads since 2009 has resulted in \u201ca competitive resurgence as both an energy-efficient freight option and a viable city-to-city passenger service,\u201d the ASCE said. Freight rail companies renewed 3,100 miles of track in 2010, the report said. The study awarded those rail efforts with a C-plus, which helped elevate the grade for all 16 categories to a D-plus, bumping it up from last year\u2019s flat D. The news was not so good on aviation, where the engineers said the ability of the nation\u2019s system to handle demand was so stretched that airport congestion and delays cost $22 billion in 2012. Aviation got a D, as did the nation\u2019s transit systems. The ASCE said investment in deteriorating transit systems has not kept pace with a more than 9 percent ridership increase in the past decade, a demand that the group projects will continue to grow. School construction, rarely broken out in a separate category in infrastructure reports, has declined to about half of what it was before the recession, the report said. While there is little data on the state of the nation\u2019s school buildings, the report pointed out that most of them were built to serve baby boomers, who now are at or near retirement age. Roadways, which generally get the most attention in these studies, again rated a D. The report noted that 42 percent of major urban highways are congested and that drivers and transport companies spend an estimated $101 billion a year in time and fuel while sitting in traffic. The study\u2019s worst grades \u2014 a pair of D-minuses \u2014 were to two critical areas that escape public notice except when they fail. Inland waterways, called \u201cthe hidden backbone of our freight network,\u201d have not been updated since the 1950s, and their current state of disrepair causes delays that cost consumers. The ASCE has been at the forefront of groups warning that post-World War II infrastructure is at the end of its natural life-span and needs immediate attention. But it has been joined by virtually every other national group with a stake in the game. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials has estimated a need for $13 billion in investment in bridges in the next 50 years. One of the best bottom-line cost estimates came from an expert panel convened two years ago by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. To maintain infrastructure at current levels, $134 billion to $194 billion more needs to be spent each year through 2035. The federal government alone should come up with $2.3 trillion over that period.", "Title: Harbor posts failing grades in water quality report card again Content: The Inner Harbor and tidal Patapsco River posted failing grades in a water quality report card for a third consecutive year in 2015, casting doubt on a goal to make the waterways safe for swimming and fishing by the end of the decade. \u201cThe harbor is alive, but it is not doing well,\u201d said Adam Lindquist, manager of the Healthy Harbor Initiative for the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore, which publishes the report card. \u201cAny reasonable person would have questions about whether or not we\u2019re going to be able to swim in the Baltimore harbor in 2020.\u201d The primary concerns continue to be fecal bacteria from the city\u2019s aged and leaking sewage system and pollutants that flow into the harbor when it rains. There were signs of slight improvement in some pollutants but not enough to change grades for the harbor and Jones Falls from an F. City leaders and business and environmental groups in 2010 set a goal of having a \u201cswimmable, fishable harbor\u201d within a decade. Now, more than halfway to 2020, with so much work left to be done to keep sewage and contaminated stormwater out of the harbor, the say the goal may be out of reach. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not terribly surprising, but it certainly is disappointing,\u201d said Terry Cummings, director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation\u2019s Baltimore Initiative. Still, environmentalists maintained optimism. For the first time since the report card initiative launched in 2013, one waterway did not receive a failing grade: The Gwynns Falls received a D. Measures of dissolved oxygen in the harbor also improved, contributing to a decrease in the large fish kills that occur when algae blooms die and create dead zones devoid of oxygen. Despite the pollution, Lindquist said, the harbor is teeming with life \u2014 National Aquarium volunteers counted 130 species of fish, crustaceans, birds and insects \u2014 and with activity, including fly-fishing in the Jones Falls and kayaking and paddle boarding in the harbor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that people aren\u2019t necessarily aware of,\u201d he said. Throughout the year, volunteers gathered 569 water samples from 49 sites across the Jones and Gwynns falls, the middle and northwest branches of the Patapsco River and its main stem leading out to the Chesapeake Bay. Officials said the data provides a detailed picture of the health of the harbor watershed, but it\u2019s not enough to reach any conclusions regarding whether conditions are improving. \u201cA D range is still not acceptable,\u201d said David Flores, the Baltimore harbor waterkeeper whose organization, Blue Water Baltimore, gathers the data each year. \u201cIt\u2019s not where we need to be or want to be in terms of water quality.\u201d Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D) has expressed support for the 2020 goal. A spokesman for the mayor did not respond to a request for comment. When the Waterfront Partnership unveiled its \u201chealthy harbor\u201d plan in 2011, officials called for policies including a statewide plastic bag fee and bottle deposit system, the creation of special water funds using money from penalties and fines, and the development of a municipal utility that could collect fees for stormwater management. \u201cWe believe we can do it, and for the first time think it\u2019s practicable,\u201d Michael Hankin, president of the partnership and chief executive of Fells Point investment firm Brown Advisory, told the Baltimore Sun at the time. But five years later, efforts to ban plastic bags at the state level have failed repeatedly. The city approved a controversial 5-cent bottle tax in 2012. Lawmakers in Baltimore County have voted to phase out the state-mandated stormwater runoff fees for property owners that opponents call the \u201crain tax.\u201d In last year\u2019s report card, the harbor advocates emphasized the importance of a nearly $500 million project to improve the flow of sewage into the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant in any effort to clean up the harbor. The project would install hydraulics to eliminate a 10-mile backup of sewage caused by a misaligned 12-foot main. It is scheduled to be completed by 2020. Lindquist said addressing the problem is a priority. \u201cNot only does it contribute to massive sewer overflows of millions and millions of gallons into the Jones Falls, but also to sewage backups in peoples\u2019 homes,\u201d he said. Advocates aren\u2019t giving up on the 2020 goal. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful we can address these issues in time to make the 2020 deadline,\u201d said Cummings, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s approaching quite rapidly, and work isn\u2019t being done quite as quickly as we would like.\u201d **\u2014 Baltimore Sun**", "Title: Can D.C. build a $45 million park for Anacostia without pushing people out? Content: Use the arrows for a 360-degree look at the 11th Street Bridge Park site. The home is a recently renovated 1920s bungalow with original hardwood floors, new granite countertops and fresh coats of paint in muted tones throughout, priced at $469,900. And as the listing pointed out, the house is walkable to the Anacostia Arts Center, a Busboys and Poets restaurant under construction and a park that, well, doesn\u2019t exist. It may never get built. If it does, it won\u2019t be for at least three years. And yet the 11th Street Bridge Park is already a selling point in real estate listings. In some ways this was the fear all along. Many people have explained the concept for the 11th Street Bridge Park by comparing the idea to New York City\u2019s High Line park. This is for good reason. The High Line, a 1.5-mile landscaped trail built atop abandoned rail lines that once served Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking District, is now the backbone of one of Manhattan\u2019s trendiest and priciest neighborhoods. The bridge park would be built atop four ****piers from the old 11th Street Bridge, which was replaced by a series of new bridges four years ago. As work began in 2009 on the new bridges, the District\u2019s Department of Transportation proposed keeping the old piers and building river overlooks on top of them. Harriet Tregoning, who was then the city\u2019s director of planning, proposed something bolder: a privately operated, publicly owned park that would connect neighbors on either side of what has been a deeply divisive social and economic barrier since whites fled the city in droves in the 1960s: the Anacostia River. It seemed like an almost fanciful notion. But the idea took off and shows few signs of slowing. The D.C. government committed to spending $8.4 million toward the $45 million cost to build and operate the park. A design competition attracted 41 architecture teams from around the world, with the winning design \u2014 which includes an environmental education center and a grove of hammocks \u2014 featured in a bevy of architecture publications. More than $2 million from private donors has poured in, and the project\u2019s director has appeared at Harvard University, the Aspen Institute and elsewhere to explain how he has done it. Washington\u2019s own version of the High Line is closer to becoming a reality than anyone could have guessed. But there is one effect of the High Line that organizers of the bridge park are trying desperately not to replicate: an immediate and explosive increase in adjacent property values. If the same thing were to happen here, opponents and supporters of the park agree, tens of thousands of residents could be priced out of their homes by rent or tax increases, or forced to move to make way for new development. About 76,000 people live within two miles of the park site. For people who have been fighting against the advance of wealth and change in the city for years, neighborhoods east of the river are viewed as the last stand. Jennifer Bryant is one resident who is watching the bridge project warily. The 30-year-old, who works for a nonprofit, pays $850 a month for a one-bedroom apartment in an area near the proposed park, Congress Heights. The neighborhood of modest homes and apartment buildings hasn\u2019t enjoyed the boom in restaurants and amenities that other neighborhoods have and suffered a dozen homicides last year. But more than a decade ago she lived in Northwest Washington\u2019s Shaw, and she remembers how swiftly the landscape changed there when new development started spreading into the neighborhood. \u201cThe housing prices in Shaw went up astronomically,\u201d she said. \u201cI see the beginnings of that in my neighborhood, and it scares me that I won\u2019t be able to stay.\u201d She\u2019s trying to buy a house nearby before it\u2019s too late, and there are already signs of rapid property value increases: Congress Heights and Anacostia ranked Nos. 1 and 3 in the city by price appreciation last year. \u201cIt is kind of a state of panic, knowing that you have to buy or you will be displaced.\u201d Through an exhaustive community engagement process involving more than 200 meetings, organizers of the 11th Street Bridge Park project \u2014 even though they don\u2019t yet have a fifth of the needed money \u2014 are simultaneously working to ensure that they won\u2019t just be filling the pockets of house flippers. \u201cIf the people who helped to shape this can\u2019t afford to live there, then we will have failed,\u201d said Scott Kratz, the project\u2019s director. But preventing such a fate may be harder than building the park itself. Economic development boosters argue that many of the projects were built on land where no one lived at the time. But each provided ample opportunity for speculators and flippers to buy up nearby homes and storefronts at depressed prices, giving them the chance to cash in once the paint dried on the city\u2019s latest economic development venture. This led to massive turnover of neighborhoods. While the District\u2019s overall population boomed from 2000 to 2010, its black population dropped by 39,000, prompting the current mayor to create the first-ever position of African American affairs director. There are only 300 Chinese Americans left in what remains of Chinatown, and half of them are battling a development project that would force them out. Relatedly, from 2002 to 2013 the number of apartments in the District renting for less than $800 a month fell by 42 percent. None of the city\u2019s projects, however, even approaches the force of the economic hurricane the High Line, with its children\u2019s play areas, art exhibits, gelato stands and manicured landscapes, helped bring to Lower Manhattan. Four years ago, then-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg estimated that the High Line had generated $2 billion in real estate investment and 12,000 jobs in the neighborhood. The park is now at the center of what is billed as \u201cthe largest private real estate development in the history of the United States.\u201d Called Hudson Yards, it will feature a skyscraper headquarters for Time Warner. No one expects the 11th Street Bridge Park, connecting a riverbank southeast of Capitol Hill to one northwest of Anacostia, to have an effect of that magnitude. But the project has rapidly gone from a pipe dream to a model for planners and architects elsewhere. The goal is much larger than adding a civic space. The 11th Street Bridge Park seeks to connect communities on each side of a river that has always represented a stark economic gap between the haves and have-nots, perhaps now more than ever. On one side, Good Hope Road and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue are rife with vacant buildings and lots surrounded by barbed wire. On the other side, a short walk from the walled-off Navy Yard, is Barracks Row, a booming restaurant and commercial district featuring Rose\u2019s Luxury, named the best new restaurant in America for 2014 by Bon App\u00e9tit magazine. That side of the river still has far higher home values, by an average of $300,000, than the east side. It has more homeowners: 73 percent vs. 50 percent. The unemployment rate is three times as low as on the east side. Structurally, the bridge park can work because the Anacostia isn\u2019t very wide. Nine hundred feet \u2014 the length of the park \u2014 isn\u2019t too far to walk. But the distance in other ways is much greater. After the park idea picked up momentum, Kratz decided that the opportunity to build something lasting for his community was too great to pass up. So he left his job and runs the project from a nonprofit in Ward 8 named Building Bridges Across the River at THEARC. A 45-year-old Northern California native, Kratz says he has attended nearly 600 meetings \u2014 chronicled in his journal at home. Despite being the face of the project, he listens to every single voice at meetings and passes credit to others whenever possible. Yet when he organized a competition for architects interested in designing a 1.45-mile elevated park, 82 firms from North America and Europe submitted proposals. Residents and a committee of experts selected a flashy plan featuring a central plaza, an enclosed cafe, an amphitheater, public art, a boat launch, a vegetable garden and the environmental educational center and hammock grove. The design, by firms OMA and Olin from the Netherlands and Philadelphia, was highlighted in Wired, Fast Company, Gizmodo and architecture and planning publications across the country. The New York Times reported that the park \u201ccould be developmentally parallel to the razing of the Cabrini-Green public housing project, economically boosting an area of Chicago long ignored by commerce.\u201d The Netherlands Embassy crowed about OMA\u2019s selection. A Mexican newspaper praised the park as an example of innovative public placemaking. Shortly after winning the mayoral election \u2014 before entering office \u2014 Mayor Muriel E. Bowser traveled with Kratz to visit the High Line. Overnight, Kratz became a must-have speaker at urban development and planning symposiums. Last spring, he appeared at both the Harvard Graduate School of Design and the Aspen Institute. He has since traveled to New York, Detroit, Louisville, Seattle, Denver, Philadelphia and elsewhere pitching the idea to funders and learning about similar work. Without the hype, he said, \u201cI never would have been able to raise the money for it. We needed that, to capture the imagination of not just the funders but also the public.\u201d Survey people on the streets of Anacostia, Fairlawn, Penn Branch and other neighborhoods on the east side of the park site, and many say they haven\u2019t heard of the project. But real estate investors and dealers immediately took notice. The median sales price for Congress Heights homes rose 37 percent last year, from $155,000 to $212,000, and Anacostia\u2019s rose 26.6 percent to $264,212, according to one metric. In Congress Heights 110 homes were sold and 37 percent were all-cash buys, according to RealEstate Business Intelligence, indicating investors were likely behind many of the deals. Lauren Donnelly, the real estate agent who listed the renovated Anacostia bungalow, shared a common sentiment: Housing in the city is getting too expensive for everyone. \u201cIt would be a game changer to connect the Hill to Anacostia, which frankly is why we envisioned people being interested in this property,\u201d she said. \u201cWho can afford the Hill anymore? I\u2019m in real estate and I still can\u2019t understand how people can afford these million-dollar homes. I think the wealth gap is really just widening.\u201d Donnelly was hardly the only real estate pro playing up the bridge park. In May, when the commercial real estate brokerage firm Marcus & Millichap touted its sale of a 15-unit apartment complex on 15th Street SE, east of the Anacostia, it issued a press release with a rendering of the winning bridge park proposal. \u201cThe recent focus on the historic Anacostia neighborhood as one of the next D.C. neighborhoods to \u2018pop\u2019 is a real phenomenon,\u201d said the firm\u2019s Marty Zupancic. \u201cMany real estate investors are realizing that \u2018day one\u2019 returns are great and the long-term appreciation possibilities are even greater.\u201d At the same time, critics began to question the project. The city has more homeless residents and less housing, while existing bridges, roads and parks east of the Anacostia are poorly cared for and in need of upgrades, they pointed out. Aren\u2019t there more important things to spend money on than another mega-project? City officials also found some reason for concern. When budget time rolled around, the D.C. Council passed a rule prohibiting public spending on construction of the park until half those costs had been raised from private sources. The council said no public money would be spent to operate the park. Because the project has $2 million and counting committed from private sources, Kratz isn\u2019t worried about public funding so much as he is about getting ahead of the real estate market. Over the following year, the group met regularly to discuss the best ways to prepare residents to benefit from the park. Then they expanded their membership to include residents and civic leaders from both sides of the river. At a meeting in June, held in a community room on the campus of the former St. Elizabeths hospital, groups of eight to 12 people huddled around tables and jotted ideas on large sheets of paper. In the conversations around the tables, the park itself was barely mentioned. \u201cIf you look at the city in recent years, you can see it: If you can pay, you can stay,\u201d said David Smith, a Ward 7 resident who works with area youth. His focus was helping African American residents build equity and receive preference for business opportunities after being passed over for other D.C. projects. \u201cI think some of [who gets hired] has to do with class, but let\u2019s be honest, some of it is racist,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t force changes through protesting and the law, America has shown over and over again that it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Arnehl Lyon, who has lived in Anacostia for 31 years, said she was looking forward to improvements coming to the neighborhood. She was confident Kratz and other organizers were making sufficient efforts to prevent displacement. \u201cSome people have concerns of getting pushed out, and I try to tell them that that\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she said. Among the group are advocates for low-income residents who aren\u2019t typically found endorsing $45 million development projects over safety-net services. Ed Lazere, executive director of the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, who was one of the most prominent opponents of the Nationals Park deal, said working with this project offered an opportunity to accomplish more than building a park. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we as a community have an economic and housing preservation plan every time there is a development, and do it simultaneously to make sure that the development doesn\u2019t push people out?\u201d he asked. Peter A. Tatian, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who frequently raises red flags about the cost of housing in the District, said that east of the river there is still need for investments that will raise some home prices. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to have some transformative kind of investments as well as some of the more basic investments that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the vision for the bridge park was different from what it is, then I might not feel that way.\u201d There are programs in other parts of the country that have begun preserving moderately priced housing adjacent to major new amenities. Most are expensive. Consider Atlanta, where 22 miles of a former freight rail corridor will become a $2.8 billion series of paths, parks and transit-oriented development projects called the Atlanta BeltLine. City officials created a tax district around the project that provides funding to help drive down the cost of housing there. A 2014 study found that 985 below-market-rate units had been developed. One of the veterans of that program, Tony Pickett, is now in Denver, where he is part of an effort to acquire land along a new mass transit route connecting downtown to the airport. After raising $15 million from a combination of public and private sources, the Denver Transit Oriented Development Fund launched in 2010. Currently 156 units are being constructed for households making 60 percent or less of the area median income and who otherwise may not be able to afford the area as it transforms. \u201cI think mitigating some of the effects is achievable,\u201d said Pickett, who has advised Kratz. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be at the front end. You\u2019ve actually got to have the residents in that community educated and organized around it from the beginning. They\u2019ve got to be saying to their public officials and others that they actually want that priority to be a part of constructing the project.\u201d In November, the bridge park\u2019s equitable development group released a list of 19 strategies, many of them borrowed from projects such as those in Atlanta and Denver. Among them are setting local hiring goals for construction and operations, forming a network of local businesses, and creating a land trust that can acquire vacant and blighted properties that can be used for housing projects in the future. The project could become a model for the D.C. Department of Housing and Community Development. One of the park\u2019s first grants, $1.2 million from the Kresge Foundation, will support the opening of a home buyers\u2019 club east of the river in partnership with nonprofit housing developer Manna,and the development of 12 affordable townhouses on Hunter Place SE. Bryant, the would-be home buyer from Congress Heights, works as an organizer for the grass-roots nonprofit ONE DC. If she can\u2019t afford to buy a house east of the river, she wonders, how will people with lesser means manage to stay? Bryant has participated in some of Kratz\u2019s meetings, but she says that unless there is money and support to prevent displacement, she would rather not see the park built at all.

Then the massive Maryland Live opened near his Dash In gas station, and in the two years since, he estimated, his lottery ticket sales have gone down by 25 percent. And so has his commission, which used to be about $3,000 a month. Maryland lottery commission officials can commiserate. On Monday, they reported that traditional lottery sales have slightly decreased for a second consecutive year, to $1.72 billion. They, too, have pointed the finger at Maryland Live for helping to end the lottery\u2019s unprecedented 16-year run of annual sales increases. Previously, the lottery weathered the opening of other smaller casinos in more remote parts of the state, such as Berlin and Perryville, said Stephen Martino, director of the Maryland State Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. But now, with bigger casinos moving into more densely populated areas, lottery officials face the prospect that the downward slide has only just begun. \u201cThere was always an expectation there was going to be cannibalization by casinos,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to be a challenge with Horseshoe [Baltimore] opening in a couple weeks, and in a couple years, we will have MGM [National Harbor] opening.\u201d Horseshoe is located by M&T Bank Stadium, where the Ravens play, on some of the lottery\u2019s most lucrative turf. Baltimore accounts for just under 11 percent of the state\u2019s population but almost 17 percent of lottery sales, state data show. Only one other locale generates a larger proportion of lottery sales: Prince George\u2019s County, future site of MGM National Harbor. It is home to only 15 percent of the state\u2019s population but generates 21 percent of lottery sales. Statewide, lottery sales decreased by 1.7 percent in fiscal 2014, compared with the previous year, agency officials said. In 2013, they decreased by 2.2 percent. While not a large percentage, it was still the third largest drop among the 43 lotteries nationwide. Surging casino revenue has more than made up for the decline in lottery sales. Last year, for example, the state netted 27 percent more in tax revenue from gambling than the year before, boosted by the opening of Rocky Gap casino and the introduction of table games, state data show. But the health of the lottery still matters for taxpayers. The state has come to rely on lottery sales, which are the fourth largest source of revenue after income, sales and corporate taxes. And the lottery still contributes nearly twice as much to the state\u2019s general fund as casinos do, about $521 million in 2014. Lottery officials managed to keep the drop in sales from eating into taxpayers\u2019 share. Martino said the agency still met its goal for 2014 for the amount of money it was supposed to turn over to the state. To get a better grip on the problem, lottery officials have hired experts to examine the impact casinos are having on their business. The results of that study are slated to be released at the lottery commission\u2019s Thursday meeting. Doug Walker, an economist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, who is involved in the Maryland lottery study, would not discuss the findings ahead of their release. But he said other studies have shown that opening more casinos generally has a negative effect on local lottery sales. \u201cThose two industries tend to be substitutes for each other,\u201d Walker said. That dynamic has played out in Pennsylvania, which has 12 casinos and generates more gambling revenue than any other state except for Nevada. Until the slot machine onslaught, Pennsylvania\u2019s lottery, like Maryland\u2019s, was on a roll, with annual sales increasing ever year, sometimes by double digits. But starting around 2006, as casinos began to spread across the state, lottery sales leveled off and then declined. Hardest hit were the areas surrounding the new slot machine parlors. In a 2008 report, Pennsylvania state lottery officials noted that when a new casino opened, lottery ticket retailers within an hour\u2019s drive reported more frequent and higher percentage declines in weekly sales than retailers further away. But Richard McGowan, a gambling expert at Boston College, noted that trend was temporary. Pennsylvania\u2019s lottery sales have gone up every year since 2010. Last year, the lottery posted a record profit. McGowan said there are other factors that can affect lottery sales such as the state of the economy, the mix of games, the size of the Powerball jackpot that year and even the weather. (Casinos do better in the spring and summer, he said, while lottery sales tend to do better in the winter.) The customer bases for lotteries and casinos also don\u2019t overlap as much as people might assume, he said. \u201cMost lottery tickets are bought on impulse when people go in to buy milk and gasoline,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cYou have to plan to go to a casino.\u201d Whether Maryland follows in Pennsylvania\u2019s footsteps may boil down to timing. Gamblers have even more choices now than they did eight years ago when Pennsylvania expanded slots. In Ohio, which started adding casinos in 2012, lottery sales are still decreasing. As lottery officials brace for the opening of Horseshoe Baltimore, they are also trying to change their luck by offering games with recognizable brands such as the Ravens or Monopoly. And they have recently talked to Maryland Live about possibly working together on marketing, officials for the casino and lottery agency said. Until then, players should expect to see scratch-off tickets featuring dice, poker hands, slot machine reels and roulette wheels, said Carole Everett, an agency spokeswoman said. As they design new games, she said, \u201cwe are looking at how players are reacting to the casino gaming experience.\u201d For Marylanders, the lottery lacks the novelty of having Vegas-style casinos on their doorstep. But, Martino said, that\u2019s also its strength. \u201cThe lottery is ubiquitous. Even with the erosion we\u2019ve had the last couple of years, the lottery is still well established in the marketplace, and in the minds of people,\u201d he said. \u201cOur challenge is going up against this competition that state policy has introduced. We have to find new games and energize our current games and responsibly encourage people to spend their entertainment dollars.\u201d", "Title: Maryland lottery sales slide for second year Content: Maryland lottery sales decreased slightly for the second year in a row, state lottery officials reported Monday. Overall, gambling contributed more to the state\u2019s coffers in fiscal year 2014 compared to the year before, because of revenue from casinos. But the decline in lottery sales suggests Maryland has joined other states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, that have seen them take a hit once more casinos open. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Traditional lottery and casinos together sent $849.2 million to the state\u2019s General Fund and Education Trust Fund, respectively, an increase of 2.4 percent from the previous fiscal year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday The lottery generated $1.724 billion in sales, down 1.7 percent. That was similar to the decline in fiscal year 2013, which ended a 16-year run of annual increases. That year, lottery sales fell by about 2 percent, to $1.756 billion. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Tax revenue from casinos more than makes up for any drop in lottery sales, but the lottery still contributes far more to the state\u2019s general fund than casinos, about $545 million last year. The state has hired researchers to take a closer look at the impact that the expansion of casino gaming is having on the state lottery. Those findings are scheduled to be released Thursday at the next Lottery and Gaming Control Commission meeting. Of note is a recent Capital News Service multi-part series on gambling in Maryland that began with an analysis of Maryland lottery sales data and found that the strongest sales tend to be higher in lower-income Zip codes in Baltimore City and Prince George\u2019s County. A prime example, CNS noted, is Park Heights in Baltimore: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday Both Baltimore and Prince George\u2019s are the sites of future casinos, with Horseshoe Baltimore slated to open Aug. 26 *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday .", "Title: Maryland gambling revenue soars Content: Maryland\u2019s bet on casino gambling is paying off, even if it appears to be hurting the state\u2019s lottery sales. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, traditional lottery revenues in Maryland fell for the first time in 16 years, by 1.9 percent, according to figures released Thursday by the Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. But casino revenues more than tripled, creating a record windfall. The state netted nearly $830 million in gambling taxes, an increase of more than 27 percent from the previous fiscal year. The lottery contributed $545 million to the general fund, while the state\u2019s casinos sent $284 million to the Education Trust Fund. More than three-quarters of the casino tax revenue came fromMaryland Live, which opened in June 2012 at the Arundel Mills mall. Stephen L. Martino, director of the Lottery and Gaming Control Agency, has hired a research firm to prove \u2014 or disprove \u2014 the hypothesis \u201cthat when you open the third-largest [commercial] casino in the United States squarely between your two most heavily populated metropolitan areas, there\u2019s going to be some movement in discretionary gaming dollars from the lottery to the casino.\u201d Lottery retailers in the vicinity of Maryland Live began reporting declines in keno and instant-ticket sales immediately after it opened, Martino said. Lottery sales and revenues had increased every fiscal year since 1996. But Martino has been telling state officials for months that the lottery\u2019s 15-year growth streak was about to end as casino revenues exploded. \u201cTaken as a whole \u2014 what we operate and what we regulate \u2014 we\u2019re quite pleased with the way the fiscal year ended,\u201d he said. Still, he added, \u201cThe fact there was a [lottery] decline is not anything we\u2019re happy about. . . . Is this just a new normal, and we\u2019re going to see a decrease and there\u2019s really not much we can do? Or are there things we can do with our games \u2014 how we market them, how they\u2019re played \u2014 where we can bring people back where we lost them?\u201d Maryland is aggressively expanding casino gambling, adding 24-hour operations, live-action table games and more properties. A fifth casino is to open next year in Baltimore, and another is coming in Prince George\u2019s County in 2016. Maryland Live is continuing its own expansion, with a 52-table poker room opening at the end of this month. The casino already has 180 table games and more than 4,300 slot machines, and business is booming: In July, the first month of the new fiscal year, Maryland Live collected more than $52 million in gross gaming revenue \u2014 a 48 percent year-over-year increase.", "Title: Maryland\u2019s billion-dollar casino boom: Big revenue boost projected from Horseshoe Content: The Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore isn\u2019t scheduled to open until the second half of next year \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped the state from counting its future haul. In its first full fiscal year, the casino will generate between $425 million and $454 million in gambling revenue, swelling state and local coffers with between $207 million and $231 million in taxes, according to a pair of fiscal studies commissioned by state gambling regulators. Under construction a few blocks from M&T; Bank Stadium, the two-story Horseshoe is expected to turn Maryland into a billion-dollar-a-year casino market. Both studies project the state\u2019s total gambling revenue to grow by about 30 percent, surpassing $1.15 billion in the fiscal year that begins July 1, 2015. A massive chunk of the Horseshoe\u2019s business will come at the expense of Maryland Live, the money-minting Arundel Mills mall casino that stands to lose a projected $130 million in slots and table-games business to its Baltimore rival that first full year. But even with money being siphoned up the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, the studies said, Maryland Live still stands to generate between $542 million and $552 million in gross gambling revenue. Drawn up by two consultants who worked independently, using their own modeling systems, the reports were presented Tuesday to the Maryland Department of Budget and Management, the Board of Revenue Estimates and others. On Wednesday, the consultants shared their findings at the Lottery and Gaming Control Commission\u2019s monthly meeting. The studies were commissioned to help the state understand \u201cwhere gaming revenues are going . . . as the competitive landscape changes,\u201d said Stephen Martino, Maryland\u2019s top gambling regulator. And more change is coming. Maryland\u2019s Video Lottery Facility Location Commission confirmed this week that it will award the state\u2019s sixth and final casino license, in Prince George\u2019s County, the week before Christmas. The commission will hold a series of public meetings next month, including one on Dec. 6 in Annapolis, at which the consultants who studied the impact of the Horseshoe will share their projections for the three Prince George\u2019s proposals. MGM Resorts is proposing to build a $925 million casino and hotel at National Harbor. An affiliate of Greenwood Racing wants to build a $761 million Parx- branded gambling resort on a wooded 22-acre lot off Indian Head Highway in Fort Washington. Penn National Gaming is proposing a $700 million Hollywood- branded casino and hotel at the historic Rosecroft harness-racing track. The second meeting, on Dec. 12, will be a public conference call with the commissioners, consultants and the three companies bidding for the lucrative license. The final meeting will be held in Baltimore on Dec. 20, when the commission plans to deliberate and then make a final decision.", "Title: MGM National Harbor pushes Maryland gambling revenue to new heights Content: MGM National Harbor raked in nearly $42 million in gross revenue during its first three weeks of operation, helping to give the state\u2019s casino industry a record-breaking December, according to data released by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency. The figures put the newly-opened casino on pace to meeting revenue projections, while elevating Maryland\u2019s gambling scene as an attraction for not only local and regional gamblers but also visitors from along the East Coast and the continental United States. But the Dec. 8 opening of the Prince George\u2019s resort also took a toll on some its competitors, drawing business from nearby Maryland Live in Anne Arundel County, and as far away as Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races in West Virginia. Maryland Live, the state\u2019s largest and most profitable casino, registered an 11 percent drop in revenue in December compared to the previous year. Still, gross gambling revenue for the casino was $48 million in December and it finished the year as the biggest generator of gambling revenue in the state. West Virginia officials reported loses of up to 20 percent at the Charles Town casino. \u201cWhen an MGM-level facility comes to a market, it attracts people,\u201d said Richard Clinch, who tracks the gambling industry as director of economic development at the University of Baltimore\u2019s Jacob France Institute. \u201cIs it substituting? Yes, from Charles Town and Anne Arundel. Is it meeting expectations? Yes. Is it sustainable? Yes.\u201d Just a few miles from the U.S. Capitol, the $1.4 billion MGM casino drew 170,000 people opening week alone. It pulled in more than $24 million from its 3,237 slot machines and $17.6 million in gross revenue from its 165 table games in December. By its third year in operations, MGM is projected to bring in more than $700 million annually in pretax gambling revenue, according to fiscal studies. Experts say the casino resort has the potential to become one of the most successful casinos in the region, reaching not only the local market but also throngs of tourists visiting nation\u2019s capital. \u201cIt is in a premier location with relatively modest competition,\u201d Clinch said. \u201cThey are already in line to do half a billion dollars or more. And this isn\u2019t even the tourist season.\u201d Maryland gaming officials say the resort\u2019s success \u201cwill fuel the continued growth of revenue\u201d in the state, a good share of which goes to an education trust fund. With MGM\u2019s opening, Maryland\u2019s six casinos earned a combined $133.5 million in gross gambling revenue for December. MGM\u2019s arrival was expected to hurt Maryland Live\u2019s business. The casino, about 35 miles north of MGM, attracts gamblers from MGM\u2019s feeder markets in Virginia and the Washington suburbs. The drop in revenue \u2014 10 percent in slots and 13 percent in table games and poker \u2014 is \u201cin line with our estimates with the new competitor entering the market,\u201d Travis Lamb, Maryland Live\u2019s chief financial officer, told the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission last week. A 2013 report commissioned by the state projects Maryland Live could see its profits drop 16 percent in 2019 as a result of MGM\u2019s opening. The casino\u2019s owners, Maryland-based Cordish Cos., are on an aggressive campaign to maintain their footing as Maryland\u2019s largest and most profitable gaming facility, investing $200 million in an expansion that includes a 17-story hotel tower expected to open in early 2018. In addition to pushing its usual marketing programs, such as Super Bowl promotions, Maryland Live also has dropped its minimum bets during some hours of the day as an incentive to gamblers, Lamb said, acknowledging that \u201cDecember wasn\u2019t a great month.\u201d Still, the Arundel Mills casino continues to dominate its rivals in the state: Horseshoe Baltimore, which made $29.7 million in December, up 9 percent from December 2015; Hollywood Casino in Perryville, $6 million in December, down nearly 4 percent from December 2015; Casino at Ocean Downs in Berlin, $4.1 million, about 6 percent higher; and the Rocky Gap Casino Resort in Flintstone, which made $3.5 million in December, about the same as the previous December. Casinos across the state also had to step up efforts to retain workers being lured by jobs at MGM National Harbor. Casino officials said last week the effects on staffing were not severe enough to disrupt operations. Some experts say the West Virginia casino, which markets to Maryland gamblers, particularly those from Montgomery and Frederick counties, will probably experience even bigger losses. West Virginia Lottery officials reported losses of $670,000, or 19.5 percent, in video lottery and about $214,000, or 22 percent, in table game revenue at the Charles Town casino in the first two weeks since MGM opened, the Associated Press reported. \u201cWe prepared well in advance by reinvesting in our business to remain competitive,\u201d Eric Schippers, senior vice president of public affairs for Hollywood Casino, told AP. \u201cOver the last few years we have built a new hotel, completely refreshed our slot machine offerings, added a new entertainment venue featuring top performers, and built new restaurants and added new amenities.\u201d MGM has captured some of the local gambling community in its first few weeks of operations, but experts also say the resort offers an alternative for the region\u2019s gamblers who normally would fly to Las Vegas or drive to Atlantic City. And, unlike it\u2019s competitors, its Las Vegas-style glamour will probably attract tourists and conventioneers, they said. \u201cYou will have a seasonal drop in the winter, but once spring starts hitting, MGM is going to see a boost in business,\u201d Clinch said. The December revenue figures also are on pace with county projections, Prince George\u2019s officials said. \u201cObviously, those results were only for 23 days in December 2016,\u201d said Thomas M. Himler, Prince George\u2019s deputy chief administrative officer for budget, finance and economic development. \u201cAnother month or two are needed to fully assess MGM\u2019s\u201d full financial benefit to the county. As of this month, the county had not received its portion of gambling taxes from the state. But the county\u2019s budget for this fiscal year, which ends June 30, is counting on nearly $19 million in revenue from the resort. About half of those funds are expected to come from gambling activities and the rest from levies imposed on hotel, property, food and concert tickets. The budget allocates the new revenue for schools and workforce training initiatives, as well as the hiring of police and emergency service staff members. The county is also betting on more income taxes from jobs at MGM. About half of the resort\u2019s nearly 4,000 workers are county residents. Prince George\u2019s officials expect the county to receive $40 million to $50 million in annually from MGM. In the long run, MGM will \u201cexceed expectations,\u201d County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D), said at a recent meeting with editors and reporters of The Washington Post. But, he said, its success would be based on not only the resort\u2019s gambling offerings but also its wider entertainment options. Since opening, MGM has hosted several big-name acts, including Bruno Mars and Duran Duran. Its theater featured a ball inauguration weekend. MGM general counsel Michael Pappas said a boxing match is in the works for the spring. \u201cWe are up 100 percent,\u201d Pappas jokingly told the state\u2019s gambling commission last week as he reported the company\u2019s first month of operations. \u201cWe did very well obviously in December. It was very strong. We had very positive response to our opening and continue to have very good customer response as we move through January and close to February.\u201d"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the projected revenue from casinos, specifically the Horseshoe Casino, and its impact on Maryland's economy.

As technology transforms banking, like it has so many other sectors, the consequence could be a dramatic decline in the industry's outposts over the next decade, experts say. \"I have no doubt that the financial industry will face a series of Uber moments,\" he said in the late-November speech in London, referring to the way that Uber and other ride-hailing companies have rapidly unsettled the taxi industry. And that's not just the opinion of one well-informed man. In a recent report, analysts with Citi said they agreed with Jenkins's view that the number of bank branches could be cut in half over the next decade. A separate survey from Accenture, the management consulting company, shows why: Shifting consumer behavior. \"We believe the consumer banks in the US and Europe are at a tipping point,\" wrote the authors of the Citi report, which was published late last month. The number of bank branches in the United States \u2014 represented by the dashed blue line in the chart below \u2014 could shrink by a third within the decade, according to their forecasts. Customer preferences are key to that industry transformation. What they want and expect from banks has changed dramatically in just a few years. In just two years, the local branch went from being a concern of half of banking customers to just a fifth. Separate data, from industry analysts Mercator Advisory Group and cited by Citi, paints the same picture: The share of customers who reported going to a branch to speak to a teller at least once in the previous year fell from 79 percent to 70 percent from 2011 to 2014. The share that reported visiting a branch to speak with a customer service representative fell from 62 percent to 45 percent. As branches matter less, online banking matters more. For the first time in Accenture's research, good online services ranked as the top reason to stick with a bank. Some 38 percent of consumers surveyed last year cited that as a reason to stay with their bank, while just 28 percent cited branch location. Twenty-eight percent also cited low fees. That holds true for populations that have long been used to visiting branches, too: Among customers over the age of 55, the preference for online banking leads the desire for convenient branch locations by a similar 10-percentage-point margin. \"This evolution in consumer preference signals a redefinition of banking convenience,\" the report's authors wrote. \"It is no longer always measured in miles to the branch or extra service hours \u2014 it is increasingly measured in clicks and apps.\" A deeper dive into the Accenture data, represented in the Citi chart below, shows how little branches factor into most bank interactions. Overall, customers engage with their banks an average of 17 times a month. Yet only two of those interactions involve human contact. In the United States, only two out of 15 monthly bank interactions involves a branch. \"Banks will follow consumer behavior and close branches as they see their consumers shift away from branches to digital,\" the authors of the Citi report write. While Citi expects an industrywide decline, it expects the transformation to play out differently both globally and within countries. Generally, developed markets can expect branch numbers to dwindle, while emerging markets can expect the opposite, the authors write. That applies to the United States, too, even though it seems to lag its European and Nordic peers by about five and 10 years, respectively. While the number of branches per capita remained unchanged in the United States from 2004 to 2014, it dropped 30 percent in Nordic countries, 22 percent in East Asia and the Pacific and 17 percent in the Euro zone, according to World Bank and Citi data. The number of branches per capita rose 26 percent in Latin American and the Caribbean. Despite the \"massive pressure\" that Barclays's Jenkins predicts, there will be regional variation in the trend toward closing branches even within countries. Wealthy cities, such as New York, and fast-growing suburbs may see an increase, even as branches are shuttered elsewhere in the country.", "Title: What it looks like when a bank goes out of its way to avoid minorities Content: According to federal prosecutors, Hudson City Savings Bank opened few branches in black and Hispanic neighborhoods around the New York and Philadelphia regions where it does much of its mortgage business. It placed few of its loan officers in these communities. It worked with hardly any mortgage brokers there, either. And its marketing was mostly elsewhere, too. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau jointly ordered the bank to pay about $33 million to make amends for these patterns, in one of the largest \"redlining\" settlements the government has ever reached. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The case, though, is notable not just for the size of the bank \u2014 Hudson City has assets of more than $35 billion \u2014 or its location, centered around the largest housing market in America. Hudson City, unlike several other banks recently accused of discrimination, wasn't charged with denying loans to qualified minorities, or jacking up their interest rates. In a subtle but more insidious claim, the government says it was \"structuring its business so as to avoid majority-Black-and-Hispanic neighborhoods.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Hudson City, in other words, was set up to ensure that few borrowers in minority neighborhoods ever even applied in the first place, according to prosecutors. \"At the core of this case is a pretty simple story,\" said Paul Fishman, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey whose office worked on the case. \"From 2009 to 2013, if you lived in a majority-black or Hispanic neighborhood and you wanted to apply for a mortgage, Hudson City Savings Bank was not the place to go. If you wanted not just to apply for one, but actually to get one so you could buy a house, your time would have been spent much better if you went to another bank.\" In the consent order announced Wednesday, Hudson City admitted no liability and said it believed it had treated all of its customers fairly. The bank agreed to a settlement, it said, \"solely for the purpose of avoiding contested litigation.\" It agreed to pay $25 million in loan subsidies to borrowers in minority neighborhoods and to invest in advertising and outreach there. The bank also must open two new branches in minority neighborhoods. And it will pay a $5.5 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Justice officials treated the case as an illustration of a broader practice of banking discrimination \u2014 and of the government's intent to crack down on it. DOJ officials said the agency has more open redlining investigations now than at any time in the last six years. \"Redlining is not a vestige of the past,\" said Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"Banks continue to build and structure their lending operations in a way that avoids or fails to really meaningfully serve communities of color.\" The government's complaint against Hudson City is a handbook of the many ways it's possible to do this. Between 2004-2010, the bank opened or acquired 54 branch locations; all but three were located outside minority neighborhoods. In this map of the New York area from the government's complaint, those branch locations are shown atop minority census tracts. Red areas have a black and Hispanic population greater than 80 percent. Orange areas have a black and Hispanic population above 50 percent: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The bank didn't accept mortgage applications at all of its branches, requiring some borrowers to travel to locations that happened to be farther away and in overwhelmingly white communities. The bank also offered a home improvement loan program for low-to-moderate income families, but the advertising for it specified that closings could only occur at one branch. It was in Fairfield, Conn., where the median income is $117,000 and the population is 92 percent white. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In the broader New York City metro, Hudson City used 162 mortgage brokers; just 12 were headquartered in minority census tracts. Not a single one of its 47 brokers in the Camden, N.J., metro area were based in such communities. Here are its broker locations throughout the region: Not surprisingly then, from 2009-2013, less than 1 percent of the bank's loan applications in the Camden metro were from minority neighborhoods. Less than 5 percent of its applications in the New York metro were for such properties. From 2009-2013, here are all of the bank's mortgage applications: Isolated from the first two maps, this last one might look as if it tells a different story \u2014 one where families in minority neighborhoods simply weren't interested in applying for loans. The other two maps, though, suggest not a shortage of interest, but potentially a lack of opportunity. And, as the government argues, many of Hudson City's competitors were busy over this same time fielding applications from these very same communities.", "Title: Move your money, move society? Content: Greg Akili had just finished paying for his $9 tuna melt at a diner in South Central Los Angeles when his waiter lingered to chat. Akili\u2019s debit card \u2014 featuring a painting of a black youth wearing a hoodie and the famous image of the 1968 Olympic medalists, heads bowed, fists raised \u2014 had caught the young man\u2019s eye. For the third time that day, Akili lit up and launched into a conversation he\u2019s been having daily, with strangers and friends alike. The 68-year-old community organizer waved his hands in the direction of his new bank about five blocks up Crenshaw Boulevard: OneUnited, the largest black-owned bank in the country. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to convince as many people as I can to open up accounts with black banks and invest in our own community,\u201d Akili said, recounting the recent interaction. \u201cI talk about this almost every time I use my card.\u201d This new card is part of a rescue effort for black banks that was launched with much fanfare last summer. But the campaign is going to need heroic measures if it is really going to save black financial institutions. The aim of the movement is clear: bolster black banks \u2014 and in the process, uplift a community that has been systematically marginalized for generations. By \u201cbanking black,\u201d organizers say, African Americans have the power to help each other buy homes, build businesses and create jobs \u2014 markers of wealth that have eluded a disproportionate number of blacks. But many of these banks are struggling to survive in the wake of the financial collapse. And despite a spate of celebrity endorsements, the drive to deliver meaningful equality by reviving financial institutions remains a long shot. Forty-two percent of African Americans own their homes, compared with 72 percent of whites, according to 2016 Census Bureau data. Nearly a fifth of black households do not even use banks, compared with 3 percent of white households, the FDIC reports. The continued disparity in access to financial services exposes black families to loan sharks charging exorbitant interest rates and fees, which can trap borrowers in a cycle of debt. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge to build up the financial assets of this community,\u201d said Russell Kashian, an economist at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater whose research focuses on minority-owned banks. \u201cEfforts to get depositors in there will augment the profits and sustainability of these banks. But if people don\u2019t support them, these communities can become bank deserts.\u201d There are 23 black banks today \u2014 far fewer than during segregation, when they were the only option for many African Americans. Their combined assets total just $5.5 billion, a small fraction of the assets of banking behemoth Wells Fargo, which has $1.9 trillion. After 30 years of banking with Wells Fargo, Akili made the switch to OneUnited in February, the same month the bank announced a partnership with Black Lives Matter and debuted its debit card depicting the youth in the hoodie. Cardholders can make automatic, regular donations to Black Lives Matter, founded after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot to death by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida. The first black-owned bank to offer Internet banking, OneUnited was well positioned to take advantage of the #BankBlack wave with its mobile and online services. The Boston-based bank with branches in Los Angeles and Miami added $6.7 million in deposits in the second half of 2016, according to FDIC records. It went from opening an average of 50 new accounts a day to more than 1,000 a day, said Teri Williams, the bank\u2019s president and chief operating officer. \u201cIt reflects a change in the understanding of the power of our dollars,\u201d Williams said, \u201cand the fact that we need to use our money more purposefully.\u201d Fresh off a tour in March, Michael Render sauntered into a bank tucked into a shopping complex in a leafy neighborhood on the southwest side of Atlanta. The 41-year-old rap artist, professionally known as Killer Mike, was exhausted after performing in 36 cities over six weeks, but he had a cause to promote. Render, an early advocate of the #BankBlack movement, was hoping to persuade potential customers in his home town to move their money from mainstream banks. The rapper arrived at the branch of Citizens Trust Bank without an entourage and spent 45 minutes shaking hands. He shared his own experience of getting rejected by large white-run institutions for loans for his chain of barbershops. A black bank, he told visitors, is more likely to approve loans to grow his business because it understands the cultural significance of barber shops. He has used black banks his whole life, following the example of his grandparents, who raised him. \u201cI am making sure my community will have institutions that will lend them money to start businesses and have mortgages,\u201d Render said later in a phone interview. \u201cNobody is going to swoop in and save the African American community. The community has to take care of itself.\u201d By the end of the day \u2014 with Render\u2019s help \u2014 Citizens Trust had netted 40 new accounts. Render is credited with having steered thousands to open accounts at black banks. Last July, after the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by police in Louisiana and Minnesota, Render called in to an MTV and BET town hall and told the audience not to riot in the streets but to \u201ctake our warfare to financial institutions.\u201d Solange Knowles, Usher, Charlamagne Tha God and other celebrities also joined the bank movement to protest the long string of police killings of black citizens \u2014 50 years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. exhorted black Americans to reject violence and harness their collective economic might to strengthen black banks. Render\u2019s goal at the time was to get 1 million Americans to deposit $100 each in a black bank. Within five days, Citizens Trust reported almost $1 million in deposits. By December, the bank had 10 times as many new accounts as it did in 2015, according to Citizens Trust; the 9,600 new accounts yielded $13 million in deposits. Large mainstream banks launched their own efforts to win back African Americans customers. Wells Fargo, which has a branch in Atlanta across the parking lot from Citizens Trust, recently announced a $60 billion mortgage lending goal to increase the number of black homeowners. But Render, like many others, is skeptical. Wells Fargo, the largest home mortgage originator in the country, had previously paid $175 million to settle a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit accusing the bank of steering thousands of black and Hispanic borrowers into subprime mortgages and charging them higher fees and rates than white borrowers with similar credit profiles. \u201cIf major corporations are swooping in out of nowhere and saying, \u2018Hey, we have this for your people,\u2019 it\u2019s because they see you doing it for yourself,\u201d Render said. Despite high aspirations, the #BankBlack campaign has produced mixed results. Many of the banks, from Chicago to Durham, N.C., experienced an immediate surge in deposits last summer when activists launched a text-message campaign calling on individuals to move their money into black banks \u2014 only to see the funds ebb away by the end of the year. Half of the banks, including Citizens Trust, ended 2016 with a drop in deposits, compared with when the push began last July, according to an analysis of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data. Eleven banks lost money. One \u2014 Seaway Bank in Chicago \u2014 went out of business in January. \u201cA lot of these banks need a lot of work across the board. We don\u2019t want to bank black arbitrarily and bank bad,\u201d said Robert Herring, one of the co- founders of BankBlackUSA, a grass-roots group that formed over social media last summer. \u201cWe can\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, everyone jump ship,\u2019 and the new ship has holes in it.\u201d Black banks reflect the economic profiles of their customer base, analysts and bank executives say. Located predominantly in working-class neighborhoods, they cater to a clientele many of whom may not meet the credit requirements of mainstream financial institutions. Black banks, on average, are five times as likely as traditional big banks to back mortgages for properties in low- to moderate-income neighborhoods, according to the FDIC. **** As a result, they were hit hardest by the recession, when a disproportionate share of African Americans lost their jobs and could not make their loan payments. \u201cWhen the American economy catches a cold, that means African Americans have pneumonia,\u201d said B. Doyle Mitchell Jr., president and CEO of the black-owned Industrial Bank, with was started by his grandfather in the District in 1934. Those economic realities make black-run institutions more vulnerable to financial shocks, even as they balance risk and profit goals with their mission of lifting the black community. OneUnited drew the ire of Boston\u2019s black community when it foreclosed on a historic black church that failed to repay its loan. The years-long proceedings ended in court, where a federal bankruptcy judge ruled in the bank\u2019s favor. Many black banks, including Industrial, do not judge loan applicants on credit scores alone; they also take into account life\u2019s hiccups like a divorce or car accident, as well as individual character and financial plans, Mitchell said. But black banks, like all banks, are ultimately in the business of making money. \u201cCan a black person just walk into a black bank and expect to get a loan? Absolutely not,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe have to be prudent in the decisions that we make. We are a business, not a charitable organization.\u201d Even so, Industrial modified home loans and dropped interest rates to help customers through the recession instead of resorting to foreclosures, Mitchell said. Other black banks introduced products tailored to customers with checkered credit histories. Citizens Trust launched the \u201cPrivilege card\u201d in November for customers with poor credit scores, charging higher interest but offering the opportunity to rebuild credit instead of borrowing from pawnshops. Liberty Bank in New Orleans partnered with U.S. Black Chambers Inc. on a low-interest credit card. But while the #BankBlack movement helped Industrial gain about 5,000 new accounts between last July and December, Mitchell said simply depositing $100 into a savings account would not make a difference to a bank\u2019s long-term viability. \u201cYou can\u2019t just give black banks your piggy bank,\u201d Mitchell said. Advocates of the #BankBlack movement acknowledge they are competing against banking giants with larger branch networks, extensive marketing and often superior technology. \u201cWhen the doors of integration opened, we thought we were always going to get better services or products with the white institutions, and black banks became the banks of last resort,\u201d said Michael Grant, president of the National Bankers Association, a lobbying group for minority-owned banks. Black banks peaked at more than 100 during the Jim Crow era. Their decline accelerated with the Great Recession, dropping from 44 in 2007 to 23 today after banks were forced to merge or close. William Michael Cunningham, a Washington-based analyst who specializes in minority-owned banks, predicts there will be seven left by 2028. A sustained #BankBlack movement can slow that decline, he said but not reverse it. \u201cIt helps the banks out. But it will not move the needle in the long term,\u201d said Cunningham, the chief executive of Creative Investment Research. To survive, black banks must expand beyond their historic base in the African American community. Chik\u00e9 Okonkwo, an actor who stars in the BET series \u201cBeing Mary Jane,\u201d said the campaign welcomes anyone who \u201cwants to use their privilege to benefit others.\u201d About a quarter to a third of the customers at black-owned banks are not black, and several banks are pushing aggressively to diversify their clientele, according to the National Bankers Association. UAW-Ford made headlines in November when the union deposited $1.5 million with First Independence, a black-owned bank in Detroit. Temple Israel, a Reform Jewish synagogue in Boston, is exploring the idea of encouraging its 4,000-member congregation to open personal accounts at OneUnited. The bank president is slated to meet with the congregation in April. \u201cWe teach that organized people and organized money is power,\u201d said Matt Soffer, a rabbi at Temple Israel. \u201cAnd if there is a movement to organize money to uplift these communities that have been systematically oppressed, anything we can do to help people grow their economy is the definition of justice in the most Jewish sense.\u201d Activism gives Americans the opportunity to confront their darkest history, said Okonkwo, who played a freedom-fighting slave in \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d the 2016 movie about Nat Turner\u2019s 1831 Virginia slave rebellion. Okonkwo says he takes time every day to educate the baristas and gas station attendants he encounters in Los Angeles \u2014 or any cashier who comments on his visually striking debit card \u2014 about why he moved his money to a black-owned bank. \u201cIf you\u2019re a white ally of Black Lives Matter or any person who thinks it\u2019s wrong that black people in America are still facing some of the issues that Martin Luther King was facing in the 1960s,\u201d he said, \u201cthen put your money where your mouth is.\u201d", "Title: Consumer group finds racial disparity in bank complaints Content: People in minority communities are more likely to submit grievances to the government\u2019s consumer watchdog about their banks than those in predominantly white areas, a trend that raises questions about fair lending practices, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition said in a report released Tuesday. The advocacy group analyzed 17,168 complaints that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau received as of June 20 from bank customers who had trouble opening accounts, depositing money, withdrawing funds and using debit cards, among other things. Using the Zip codes included in the complaints and Census Bureau data, researchers determined that black and Hispanic neighborhoods reported a disproportionate number of problems with their banks. Consumers from predominantly black communities accounted for nearly 10 percent of complaints to the CFPB, though they represented only 6 percent of households examined in the study. NCRC researchers said banks were more likely to address the concerns of consumers from predominantly white neighborhoods than those from minority areas. Yet minority customers were more likely to receive monetary relief as compensation for their griev\u00adances,\u00ad according to the report. \u201cThe level of products and serv\u00adices serving communities of color continues to be second-rate,\u201d said John Taylor, president and chief executive of the NCRC. \u201cThere isn\u2019t the same level of commitment to communities of color from the banks that we\u2019d all like to see.\u201d Industry groups took issue with the methodology of the NCRC report and the conclusions drawn from the findings. For instance, industry officials said, the NCRC could not definitively determine the race of those complaining about their banks \u201cThe analysis is flawed and does not support the report\u2019s recommendations,\u201d said Richard \u00adRiese, senior vice president of the Center for Regulatory Compliance at the American Bankers Association, a trade group. \u201cThe banking industry\u2019s record of supporting a color-blind, discrimination-free lending environment remains strong.\u201d The NCRC\u2019s report did not name individual banks, but the CFPB has jurisdiction over institutions with at least $10 billion in assets, including the nation\u2019s largest financial firms. The findings highlight deep-rooted tensions within minority communities over disparities in financial services. For decades, large banks had few, if any, branches in communities of color, leaving families with limited access to mortgages and auto loans. The Community Reinvestment Act, passed in 1977 to encourage banks to lend to low- and \u00admoderate-income communities, helped narrow gaps in service. But the housing crisis revealed a new kind of discrimination against black and Hispanic borrowers, who were disproportionately targeted by unscrupulous lenders for risky, high-cost mortgages, advocates say. Once the housing market crashed, the unsustainable subprime loans led to an enormous loss of wealth for minorities. The NCRC is calling on the banking regulators to use the CFPB complaint database to assess whether institutions are providing affordable and reliable loans and bank accounts. Officials at the CFPB declined to comment on the report, but a spokesman said consumer complaints help the bureau \u201csupervise companies, enforce federal consumer financial laws and write rules and regulations.\u201d The coalition\u2019s report arrives amid a growing number of bank branch closings that advocacy groups say could exacerbate service disparities in communities of color. Nearly 1,000 bank branches closed across the country for the year ended June 30, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to close a branch in a neighborhood that already has six, but its a whole other thing to be the last branch standing and to close,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cYou can guarantee that the basic banking services for that neighborhood will be check cashers, pawn shops and payday lenders.\u201d", "Title: An anchor for generations of children says goodbye after 50 years Content: Just before 8 on the last morning of her 2,604th week on the job, a nurse in a kaleidoscopic scrub top hobbled across the lobby\u2019s cream-colored tile and switched on the lights. At a computer in the back of the D.C. neighborhood health clinic, Clydia Lavenia McAbee \u2014 \u201cMiss McAbee\u201d to most \u2014 adjusted her black-rimmed Ray-Ban reading glasses to review the day\u2019s list of patients, almost all of whom she knew well: Harlem, the 1-week-old whose mother Miss McAbee had cradled 25 years ago. Dyllan, 5, one of seven siblings she\u2019d weighed, vaccinated, soothed and scolded since 1999. Me\u2019Ryah, who in 20 years of care had grown taller than her longtime nurse. \u201cThey are my children. My grandchildren,\u201d she said. \u201cNot no nieces and nephews. They are closer than that.\u201d And to each of them, she was about to say goodbye. On Friday, Miss McAbee will retire after 50 years with the Children\u2019s National Health System, leaving behind a career that has made her an anchor for generations of Washington families and a tenure that is exceptionally rare among the 6,300 employees at Children\u2019s. To Miss McAbee\u2019s colleagues in one of the country\u2019s most renowned pediatric health-care systems, she is many things: a living time capsule, an institution within an institution, a matriarch whose extended family members number in the thousands. \u201cShe is special,\u201d said Rosella Castro, who oversaw Children\u2019s medical outposts **** for 17 years before moving into a part-time role. \u201cHer home is the clinic. . . . She really wants to be a mother to these kids.\u201d **** Over a career spanning a \u00adhalf-century and more than 180,000 doctor appointments, her profession and city have endured relentless change. She no longer wears a white dress and nurse\u2019s cap to work or takes children\u2019s temperatures with a \u00admercury-filled glass rod. It\u2019s been years since she could bring a neglected child into her own house for a home-cooked meal and a warm bed. A child\u2019s insurance, Miss McAbee said, matters far more than it used to. And the number of licensed practical nurses like her, who have less training and make less money than registered nurses, has dwindled as many hospitals phase them out. So, too, has she witnessed the District\u2019s convulsions over the decades: the 1968 riots, a crack epidemic, an AIDS outbreak and a wave of gentrification by affluent newcomers. But Miss McAbee, whose Baptist church and tidy haircut have remained the same since the \u201950s, doesn\u2019t care much for change. At 72, she has long talked of quitting her job at a Children\u2019s-run neighborhood clinic in Northwest Washington, but no one there believed her. Pleas from her husband and daughter hadn\u2019t persuaded her to leave, nor had a pair of knee replacements or a bout with breast cancer. She bought a Mercedes and dubbed it her retirement car \u2014 in 2003. She couldn\u2019t stop working, because parents and children needed help, and she knew how to help them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d she said. She has always been stern, her dark brown eyes capable of a glare so daunting it makes grown men squirm. It once bothered her that people thought she was mean, but better they hear the hard truth from her, she decided long ago, than from no one at all. About 8:30 that morning, Terri Abbott arrived at the clinic with her two youngest sons, ages 8 and 13, and greeted Miss McAbee in a hallway. \u201cI\u2019m retiring come March the 20th,\u201d the nurse told her. Abbott\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cFor real, Miss McAbee?\u201d Abbott, 37, has known her since birth. She still remembers Miss McAbee asking her mother, who struggled with drug addiction, whether her daughter was attending school and staying out of trouble. She also remembers the day when, at 16, she walked into the clinic pregnant with a baby girl. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hide your face now,\u201d Miss McAbee assured her. That baby girl is now 21 and, for the past year and a half, has brought her own son to the clinic. Still stunned by the news, Abbott asked who would replace her. \u201cThis is your home,\u201d she argued. Miss McAbee insisted that little would change. That few would notice her absence. Miss McAbee was wrong. A 17-year-old slouched in a waiting-room chair next to her mother. India Starks, who had been cared for by Miss McAbee her whole life, had come to get a physical before heading to college in North Carolina. Miss McAbee greeted her mother \u2014 \u201cHey, baby\u201d \u2014 then said hello to the teen, who was dressed in black with a Starbucks cap pulled low on her forehead. The girl continued to stare at her phone. She and her mother had argued earlier that morning. Miss McAbee \u2014 who after a divorce raised both of her children alone \u2014 shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at McAbee. She ain\u2019t done nothing to you,\u201d she said, turning away before adding, \u201cThe world don\u2019t owe you nothing.\u201d Miss McAbee, say those who know her, has never lacked candor. \u201cShe takes no tea for the fever,\u201d said her sister, Betty Marshall. Miss McAbee is the oldest of four kids, all of whom moved from Ohio to the District after their father died. Their mother often labored six days a week as a domestic worker, and in her absence, Clydia ensured that beds were made and dishes washed. She started at Children\u2019s Hospital in 1965, making about $6,000 a year. She later worked in oncology, where she cared for children with cancer \u2014 and mourned their deaths. \u201cShe went through the grieving process like she was a parent,\u201d said her daughter, Corletta Black, 54. \u201cShe was like a second \u00admother.\u201d So much so that, for families who couldn\u2019t afford to bury their children, Miss McAbee persuaded the owner of a funeral home who attended her church to hold services at almost no cost. Those who know Miss McAbee have seen her buy people lunches and Thanksgiving dinners, and give them diapers and even cash. She used to deliver nebulizers to the homes of asthmatic children, making their parents promise to bring the machines back the next day. Pained by how many kids she saw without proper clothing, Miss McAbee began to ask her colleagues and friends for donations of clean, gently used garments. Erika Williams, 44, was first treated by Miss McAbee as a child and later brought all four of her own kids to the clinic. When she gained custody of her grandson about 18 months ago, she brought him to the patient waiting room, where a wooden cabinet stands against the back wall. \u201cClydia\u2019s Closet,\u201d reads a plaque on the side. Williams picked up boots, tennis shoes and a coat for him. At the clinic, Miss McAbee helped India, the surly 17-year-old, through her physical. She drew blood (\u201cThere you go, babycakes.\u201d) and tested the girl\u2019s eyes (\u201cYou blind.\u201d). India walked outside as the teen\u2019s mother, Willette Branch, gripped both of Miss McAbee\u2019s hands. \u201cShe\u2019s going to college. We did a good job,\u201d Branch said, smiling. \u201cI love you.\u201d Miss McAbee reached for a tissue. Moments later, India came back in and walked straight to Miss McAbee, leaning down to embrace her. \u201cYou behave,\u201d Miss McAbee told India. \u201cYou know what to do.\u201d Miss McAbee\u2019s firm brand of care has, to her surprise, spawned generations of children who years later still desperately seek her approval. Both her daughter and sister have walked alongside her when, in malls and restaurants, people approached with news. _Miss McAbee_ , they\u2019ll say, _guess what. I finished high school. I went to college. I did what you told me to do._ She has inspired such devotion in part because amid her rigidity exists a deep well of compassion. It showed that afternoon when she picked up an 18-month-old, pressed her cheek against his and danced with him in the hallway. \u201cI got you, baby boy,\u201d she said. And when she was drawing blood from a 10-year-old and he couldn\u2019t tell her his birthday, she whispered it into his ear and asked him to repeat it until he memorized the date.

Producing the work that assists Congress in its oversight role involves several distinct activities, from planning investigations to going on field visits to reporting to Congress and the public on what GAO learned. \u201cThe fun part about doing this is getting out there and speaking to those officials,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cIn some ways, being a GAO auditor is easy. People like talking about their jobs and why they do it this way or that way.\u201d It gets tougher, however, when the agency under scrutiny worries about what GAO will find. \u201cThere\u2019s naturally an adversarial relationship between an agency and those who audit it,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cThe challenge is to try to keep an open mind and develop a relationship so they can talk candidly about their problems, but trust that you\u2019re not going to do some kind of \u2018gotcha\u2019 audit.\u201d Caldwell also must work with many different congressional committees with jurisdiction over maritime issues that often have competing priorities and interests, said Cathy Berrick, Caldwell\u2019s former supervisor. \u201cHe navigates that very well, making sure he\u2019s providing them with the information they need to have oversight,\u201d Berrick said. \u201cHe has built up a large knowledge base that has increased the sophistication of GAO\u2019s capability in that area.\u201d Caldwell has been studying port security for about 10 years and views cybersecurity as an emerging area of concern. In June, his team released a report saying the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) needs to do a more thorough job of keeping ports protected from cyber intrusions and should conduct a risk assessment that \u201cfully addresses cyber-related threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.\u201d Caldwell said the issue arose as a concern after a cyber attack case in Europe, in which hackers got into a system that moves containers around a seaport and used the information to smuggle drugs in and out of the port, Caldwell said. GAO found no similar cases in the U.S. but Caldwell said, \u201cWe don\u2019t know if ports would know it happened, to be honest. There\u2019s almost a lack of awareness\u201d GAO recommended that the Coast Guard assess cyber-related risks as it does physical security such as security cards and gates. Berrick said Caldwell\u2019s work also has resulted in security improvements of shipping containers that deliver materials to the U.S. and other countries. \u201cHe made a number of recommendations to strengthen container security,\u201d she said. Berrick pointed out that the U.S. doesn\u2019t own or regulate much of the critical infrastructure it examines; therefore it must develop relationships with owners, operators and government agencies so key people understand the state of security and how they provide better protection. In another investigation, Caldwell\u2019s team looked at whether cruise lines were reporting crime in a timely way. Caldwell said that pressure from the report, and from senators looking into the issue, led to language in a Coast Guard authorization act for improving crime reporting. Crime statistics for cruise lines now can be found at one government website, instead of people having to contact individual cruise ship lines for the information, he said. Caldwell, who plans to retire in early January, spent 10 years in the field before starting his job at GAO\u2019s Washington headquarters. He first worked in GAO\u2019s European and San Francisco offices and, over the years, has worked on topics ranging from piracy and Arctic issues to supply chain, passenger vessel and energy tanker security. While he was a candidate for the Senior Executive Service, Caldwell had the opportunity to take a temporary assignment with the House Select Committee on Hurricane Katrina, which looked at preparations and response. \u201cIt was fascinating from a historical perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin 10 days of Katrina striking, I was in a Black Hawk helicopter with the National Guard, talking to the governor and officials involved in the response.\u201d Caldwell always knew he wanted to work for the federal government on national security issues. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about GAO, but it has allowed me to do that\u2014apply analysis to those national security issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat has kept me here is the variety, the people I work with and the issues I work on.\u201d _This article was jointly prepared by the Partnership for Public Service, a group seeking to enhance the performance of the federal government, and washingtonpost.com.

The Government Accountability Office report credited the FAA with taking steps to deter hackers but concluded that \u201csignificant security control weaknesses remain, threatening the agency\u2019s ability to ensure the safe and uninterrupted operation of the national airspace.\u201d The FAA said it intends to implement the 14 changes recommended in the GAO report. In a written response to the GAO last month, Keith Washington, acting assistant secretary for administration at the Department of Transportation, said the FAA already had achieved six \u201cmajor milestones\u201d toward improving cybersecurity and agreed with the GAO recommendations for improvements. A central finding in the GAO report is that the aviation agency has not fully put in place an organization-wide structure to protect its computers from \u00adattack. The report says threats to the air traffic control system are growing from terrorists, criminals and foreign governments. The GAO withheld details of specific security vulnerabilities. Air traffic controllers are responsible for the average 2,850 flights aloft at any given moment. The 14,000 controllers work in three types of facilities: 500 airport control towers that oversee landings and takeoffs; 160 facilities that direct planes to and from cruising altitudes; and 22 centers that supervise aircraft at cruising altitude. The most serious threat would come if hackers broke into the system and found a way to disrupt the flow of aircraft without being noticed. A breach that was detected immediately, however, would be less likely to significantly compromise operations, experts said. \u201cThe system is designed with contingency plans for a shutdown of any particular system,\u201d said Steven B. Wallace, an aviation safety consultant who formerly directed the FAA office of accident investigation. When fires \u2014 as in a recent incident in Chicago \u2014 tornadoes or other issues cause the rare shutdown of a facility, there are plans in place to transfer its responsibilities elsewhere in the system. \u201cIs it conceivable that a hack could go systemwide? I doubt it,\u201d Wallace said, while acknowledging that ingenious hackers could strike anywhere. \u201cI don\u2019t know which computer system you couldn\u2019t say that about.\u201d The GAO said, however, that as the FAA moves to implement the collections of computer-based systems known as NextGen, there will be increased integration of the FAA\u2019s national air system computers, \u201ccreating a greater need to secure these systems from remote, external threats.\u201d The FAA needs to do a better job of controlling access to computer systems and establishing multiple firewalls to protect against unauthorized intruders, the GAO said. It also should enhance encryption of sensitive data and ensure that employees and contractors take required security training. \u201cA fundamental cause for these various weaknesses is that the FAA has not yet implemented an effective program for managing organizational information security,\u201d the report said. The FAA has created a cybersecurity steering committee, but the report said its work was hindered by disagreements between the agency\u2019s technological office and the air traffic control group.", "Title: The Navigator: Cruise safety\u2019s improvements \u2014 or lack thereof Content: As Carnival Corp. announced plans to salvage the Costa Concordia last week, the world\u2019s attention focused again on cruise safety \u2014 or rather, the lack of it. The Concordia struck a reef off the coast of Italy in January and partially sank, claiming the lives of 32 passengers. Carnival will refloat the hull in a $300 million salvage operation said to be the largest in history. Coincidentally, it\u2019s been almost two years since the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, a law that promised to make cruising safer by requiring cruise lines to install peepholes in cabin doors, improve the handling of crime evidence and report crimes to the Coast Guard and the FBI. Given that travelers are thinking about security on cruise ships and that the summer vacation season is just around the corner, there\u2019s no better time to ask whether the rules are working as intended. But that\u2019s a hard question to answer. The law couldn\u2019t have prevented the sinking of the Concordia, for example. That was reportedly caused when its captain, Francesco Schettino, foolishly steered his vessel away from its programmed route to do a maneuver known as a sail-by salute. And common sense can\u2019t be legislated, as they say. But what about some of the other provisions? David Peikin, a spokesman for the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), a cruise industry trade group, wouldn\u2019t comment on whether the law is working but insisted that cruising is safe and that passenger safety remains the industry\u2019s \u201cnumber one\u201d priority. Peikin pointed to several independent studies showing even before the law went into effect that the cruise experience was exceedingly safe and said that cruise lines are reporting crimes to the government as required. I wondered what others thought, so I revisited some of my sources from a 2010 column on the act. Interestingly, that story also featured a quote from a CLIA spokesman about safety being the No. 1 priority. Kendall Carver, chairman of the International Cruise Victims Association, a passenger advocacy group, doesn\u2019t think that the law has helped passengers. \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty,\u201d he said. In just the past month, several stories have raised serious concerns about cruise ship safety. A TV expos\u00e9 about alcohol consumption on cruise ships showed passengers on a Royal Caribbean vessel drinking during a mandatory safety briefing. Royal Caribbean denounced the report as \u201csensationalistic\u201d and said that it trains its staff in how to serve alcohol to guests in a responsible way. Also, five men in St. Kitts went on trial for robbing 17 cruise passengers on a shore excursion in 2010. The suspects are accused of taking money, phones and jewelry from the passengers in a crime that the St. Kitts & Nevis Observer called \u201cthe most infamous crime in St. Kitts in recent time.\u201d And then there\u2019s actor John Travolta, who is reportedly being sued for sexual harassment by Fabian Zanzi, a former cruise line employee. The star of \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d is accused of accosting Zanzi on a Royal Caribbean ship and offering him $12,000 for sex. Are any of these incidents being reported to the FBI and the Coast Guard? Not exactly. Some of these alleged crimes didn\u2019t take place on cruise ships, so they\u2019re excluded. Others happened before the current reporting requirements went into effect. Peikin says that these incidents, as well as the Costa disaster, have nothing to do with the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. \u201cThere is no connection between the two,\u201d he says. Fair point. But a look at the cruise ship crime statistics that are reported (if you can find them on the Coast Guard Web site) raises other concerns. In the Coast Guard\u2019s latest report, which covers Jan. 1 through March 31, cruise lines disclosed just three incidents involving missing persons and alleged crimes. In the previous quarter, they also reported only three, and in the one before that, zero. In all, cruise lines have reported only 19 crimes to the government since 2011 \u2014 a number that to some seems improbably low. One who thinks it\u2019s too low is James Walker, a maritime lawyer based in Miami. \u201cThese numbers are even less than the number of crimes the cruise lines will admit occurred,\u201d he says. Back in 2006, Royal Caribbean told Congress that in the previous three years, 66 rapes and sexual assaults had been reported, he says. But in a civil case that Walker\u2019s firm handled, a court ordered the cruise line to produce its raw crime data, which showed that the total number of reported sex-related crimes was actually around 273 \u2014 a number that included allegations of sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual harassment and inappropriate touching. The International Cruise Victims Association\u2019s Carver is also skeptical of the crime statistics. He alleges that the actual number of crimes is hundreds of times higher. \u201cThat\u2019s the most disappointing part of the new law,\u201d he says. \u201cThe statistical database is largely incomplete.\u201d The problem is a loophole in the law, which stipulates that the FBI doesn\u2019t have to include open files in crime statistics. As long as a case isn\u2019t closed, it doesn\u2019t get reported. \u201cMany travel agents are now marketing cruises by referring their clients to the Coast Guard database for the proposition that there are virtually no crimes at all on cruise ships,\u201d Walker adds. \u201cIt makes a mockery of the law.\u201d All this makes it difficult to say whether the law is working. There were no comprehensive, publicly reported crime statistics for the cruise industry before the act went into force. And if industry critics are to be believed, no reliable numbers that passengers could compare those crime figures with are being disclosed today, anyway. So it\u2019s impossible to know whether all the other items the act requires \u2014 the peepholes, the evidence handling, the additional rights granted victims to sue a cruise line \u2014 are doing any good. But that may not be the worst part. With only a few lonely voices, such as Carver and Walker, who advocate primarily for victims, cruise passengers have no organized lobbying presence in Washington to raise their concerns. CLIA spent nearly $2 million lobbying Congress last year, slightly less than what it spent in 2010, which was a record. And that doesn\u2019t include individual lobbying by large cruise lines such as Carnival ($710,000 in 2011) and Royal Caribbean ($1.1 million). So we\u2019re in the same place we were in before the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act: with no idea how safe a floating vacation actually is. The cruise industry insists that it\u2019s more secure than any land vacation. Critics say that it\u2019s one of the riskier trips you can take. The truth probably lies somewhere in between.

Early Thursday, the Chinese state television reported that the death toll had climbed to 75, leaving more than 360 people still unaccounted for. Just 14 people are known to have survived the disaster on the Yangtze River. Most were retirement-age tourists on an 11-day cruise. In the water, a tumble of beds, tables and chairs blocked divers\u2019 access into the capsized Eastern Star. Some cabin doors also were locked, officials said, making the job of finding survivors and retrieving bodies significantly harder. Atop the hull, rescue teams began cutting through the metal in an attempt to find anyone who might be trapped in air pockets, the official People\u2019s Daily reported. Amid the search, questions emerged about whether the boat, which had four decks and a relatively shallow draft, had been sufficiently stable to withstand stormy weather. Also facing scrutiny is its captain, who continued the cruise as rain and wind intensified Monday night \u2014 even while other vessels dropped anchor. The captain and his chief engineer were among the first to be rescued. Police are questioning them. But the Chinese government, ever wary that public outrage could be turned against the authorities, attempted to control the narrative. Officials discouraged local journalists from visiting the scene and tried to prevent foreign journalists from speaking to passengers\u2019 relatives. China\u2019s Internet police issued warnings against those who sought to point fingers or spread malicious rumors online. Censors deleted critical comments on social media. The government\u2019s main focus, however, remained on the rescue effort, with nearly 2,000 workers, more than 100 boats and 200 divers deployed in what could be China\u2019s worst ship-related disaster in nearly seven decades. Helicopters and planes scoured the waters of the Yangtze as the search area expanded to 135 miles downstream. Transport Ministry spokesman Xu Chengguang said that divers would continue searching for survivors and try to move the vessel only when more salvage boats arrived. \u201cOur number one priority is to rescue people,\u201d he said at a televised news conference. \u201cAs long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not give up.\u201d But Xu said that strong currents, wind and waves made the job harder. Sand and mud kicked up by the storm reduced visibility underwater. Diver Zhang Hucheng said he and his colleagues stay underwater for an hour at a time. \u201cNow we are completely relying on our hands to search,\u201d he told the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cEven though we have strong torchlights, the river water is very muddy. We can\u2019t see anything.\u201d Two people, including a 65-year-old woman, were brought out alive from air pockets inside the vessel Tuesday after rescuers apparently heard voices yelling for help. Xinhua showed images of bodies in yellow bags being ferried away by military rescue workers. Premier Li Keqiang, the Communist Party\u2019s point man in disasters, was photographed bowing before two bodies covered in white shrouds. Li has also been photographed poring over maps, directing rescue workers and meeting survivors, to demonstrate, in the words of officials, how genuinely the government \u201ccares for the people.\u201d According to China Digital Times, a Web site dedicated to detailing media censorship, the government issued a directive to domestic news organizations not to send reporters to the scene and instead to rely on official media. \u201cReporters already there must be immediately recalled,\u201d the directive said. \u201cAll coverage must use information released by authoritative media as the standard.\u201d Nevertheless, some reporters from outside the state mouthpieces turned up, according to foreign journalists in the area. In 2011, journalists and others used social media to break news of a high-speed train crash in the eastern city of Wenzhou in which 40 people died and ask uncomfortable questions about safety. The resulting investigation saw powerful heads roll in China\u2019s Railways Ministry, which was subsequently dismantled. Ever since, the Communist Party has dramatically cracked down on freedom of speech online. On Wednesday, Internet police in the central province of Hubei, where the disaster occurred, denounced \u201clawless people who ignore the truth, maliciously spread rumors online and even send out scam texts to families of the victims.\u201d On a social media account, authorities vowed to punish anyone who made up rumors. Internet police in the northeastern city of Shenyang said only people with \u201culterior motives\u201d or who were \u201cdead evil\u201d would want to point fingers at a time when the nation should be focused on the recovery effort. Some social media posts \u2014 later deleted by authorities \u2014 criticized the effort to control news reporting. Others complained that the captain of the Eastern Star had deserted his sinking ship. \u201cThe captain and crew members displayed 100 times better escaping skills than the passengers,\u201d one user posted on a microblogging site. \u201cThe captain is so professional he escaped unscathed.\u201d On Tuesday, angry relatives of the passengers gathered at a government office in Shanghai \u2014 from where many of the passengers had booked the tour \u2014 and demanded more information, some briefly scuffling with officials, according to the Reuters news agency. Many relatives were taken Wednesday to the rescue site at Jianli in central Hubei province and were briefed by officials. One of those aboard the vessel was Gao Qianyue, who had just celebrated her third birthday and was taking her first boat trip with her newly retired grandparents. \u201cShe is only 3 years old, and now she is soaked in water \u2014 please save her first,\u201d the girl\u2019s mother cried, according to local media, before pointing at her husband. \u201cThe three people he is closest to \u2014 his mom, his dad and his daughter \u2014 are all on the boat, with their life uncertain. What is he going to do? What should we do?\u201d In Shanghai, Wang Sheng said he had paid for his 72-year-old father and 65-year-old mother to take the cruise to see the Three Gorges Dam but regretted he had not gone along. \u201cMy mom was reluctant to go,\u201d he cried, according to Xinhua. \u201cIf only I had gone with my father. At least I am young and strong, and I can swim. Maybe I could even have saved him. I am so sorry.\u201d Meanwhile, attention turned to the safety of the Eastern Star, a 251-foot-long and 36-foot-wide vessel, especially in stormy weather. \u201cOur shipbuilding and design have not taken into consideration extreme weather conditions such as storms and tornadoes when building ships used for inland rivers,\u201d said Liu Shuguang, deputy director in the College of Economics at the Ocean University of China in Qingdao. \u201cThe capsized boat has a quite shallow bottom but is very high. It is only suitable for calm and tranquil weather conditions,\u201d Liu added. But the possibility of human error playing a role also appeared to grow after local media reported that three other ships nearby had dropped anchor as the storm intensified. \u201cThe visibility was terrible, like being in fog, and the rain was interfering with the radar so you couldn\u2019t make anything out,\u201d Li Yongjun, the captain of a freighter, told Xinhua. Li said he decided to slow down, drop anchor and wait out the storm. As he did so, the Eastern Star passed his ship and continued upriver. Gu Jinglu, Liu Liu and Xu Yangjingjing contributed to this report. **Read more:** Survivor recounts harrowing ordeal aboard sinking Chinese cruise ship China bans \u2018unofficial\u2019 weather forecasts", "Title: A luxury cruise ship sets sail for the Arctic, thanks to climate change Content: The once forbidding Arctic region, home to polar bears and ice-covered seas, has melted enough that this summer it\u2019s open not only for shipping but high-end tourism. The proof lies in the Crystal Serenity cruise, a luxury tour of the Arctic that promises to carry passengers through the storied Northwest Passage and across the roof of the world. The controversial cruise was scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Seward, Alaska, and dock 32 days later in New York City. As many as 1,700 passengers and crew were expected to be on board the Crystal Serenity, which will transit the Bering Strait and visit Greenland. Tickets for the historic journey started at about $22,000 and went into the six figures. That price doesn\u2019t include extras that guests can book, such as a helicopter ride or side excursion to a Greenland glacier. Despite the cost, the trip sold out quickly, and the company behind it said a second journey is already in the planning. The location might be the Arctic, but the Crystal Serenity\u2019s 1,100 guests aren\u2019t exactly roughing it. The $350 million ship is 820 feet long and has 13 decks and 535 state rooms. It has a driving range and putting green, a casino, a movie theater, half a dozen restaurants, multiple pools and a library with thousands of books, games and DVDs. There\u2019s also a spa, fitness center, hair salon and 24-hour complimentary room service. That would leave the passage open to a wave of ships that could transform what, until now, has been among the least traveled places on Earth. Such a scenario has caused angst among those eager to explore the Arctic as well as those who want it protected. The expedition also has raised safety concerns. The Northwest Passage is extremely isolated and remote. The small towns that dot its shores could hardly handle an influx of patients if there were a major medical emergency. And were the ship to somehow get stranded or need help, sending aid could be dangerous, uncertain and massively challenging. \u201cThe area is plagued by a lack of adequate nautical charts, virtually no navigation aids, poor communication systems, and a lack of infrastructure,\u201d Roger Rufe, a former vice admiral of the U.S. Coast Guard, said recently. The Bering Strait, which includes a passage as narrow as 55 miles in one location, is of \u201cprincipal concern,\u201d he said. Even as the first cruise begins, the Coast Guard is continuing to study the safety and efficiency of navigation through the strait. A report is expected soon. \u201cThe [Crystal Serenity] is the most recent example of why the Coast Guard\u2019s port access route study can\u2019t come soon enough. Rules of the road are essential for getting ahead of shipping and preventing accidents and impacts, rather than reacting after the fact,\u201d said Henry Huntington, director of Arctic Ocean projects at the Pew Charitable Trusts. That\u2019s not to say there hasn\u2019t been huge amounts of preparation for the voyage. U.S. and Canadian government and Coast Guard officials have worked closely with Crystal Cruises to plan for the trip \u2014 and for any emergencies that might arise along the way. The ship will be be accompanied by an ice-breaking boat and two helicopters. \u201cCrystal Cruises has safely operated its ships routinely in remote areas, including long trans-oceanic voyages for over 25 years, and, in fact, the Northwest Passage is not as remote as one might expect,\u201d said Paul Garcia, director of global public relations for the company. \u201cDuring the transit, Crystal Serenity will be passing many communities, including ones where commercial jets provide regularly scheduled air service. Furthermore, Crystal Serenity plans to transit during the period of when ice concentration is minimal. \u2026 Anticipated ice conditions are within safe operating parameters for Crystal Serenity.\u201d The ship will be getting constant updates from the Canadian Ice Service, Garcia said. It features \u201ctwo ice searchlights, forward looking sonar, a thermal imaging camera and software to improve the ability to pick up small contacts on the radar such as small amounts of ice.\u201d Yet two researchers told the Washington Post Monday that the passage is hardly ice free \u2014 which is not to say that it\u2019s anything the ship can\u2019t handle. \u201cThe southern route (Amundsen\u2019s route) is now fairly clear of ice, but that does not mean no ice at all,\u201d Mark Serreze, who heads the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo, noted by email. \u201cLast I checked, ice could be seen (broken up floes) in \u2026 satellite images. Today, it is pretty cloudy in the region, so it\u2019s hard to pin down what is going on. However, I expect that the ship will be able to navigate.\u201d Christian Haas, a researcher at York University in Canada, consulted Canadian Ice Service data and added that some ice remained in the southern Beaufort Sea plus Peel Sound and significant ice in Victoria Strait and M\u2019Clintock Channel. \u201cFrom our surveys we know that the ice in Peel Sound is only first-year ice and will probably disappear soon and completely,\u201d Haas said via email. \u201cHowever, the ice in the other regions are remnants of multiyear ice, and thick chunks of that will very likely survive the summer. Apart from those well defined ice regions, there will be chunks of ice lingering here and there.\u201d But then, perhaps that\u2019s just what Crystal Serenity\u2019s passengers are paying for."], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the safety improvements in cruise ships, specifically mentioning the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act and its impact.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most comprehensive and relevant information about cruise ship safety improvements, directly addressing the query.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Coincidentally, it\u2019s been almost two years since the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act, a law that promised to make cruising safer by requiring cruise lines to install peepholes in cabin doors, improve the handling of crime evidence and report crimes to the Coast Guard and the FBI."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "This passage indirectly discusses cruise ship safety by mentioning a luxury cruise ship's journey through the Arctic, implying that safety measures must have improved for such a trip to be possible.", "listwise_reason": "While it doesn't directly address safety improvements, it provides relevant context about the current state of cruise ship operations, which can indirectly suggest safety improvements.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The proof lies in the Crystal Serenity cruise, a luxury tour of the Arctic that promises to carry passengers through the storied Northwest Passage and across the roof of the world."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses a specific incident of a capsized Chinese cruise ship, which indirectly suggests issues with cruise ship safety, but does not provide information on improvements.", "listwise_reason": "While it provides relevant context about cruise ship safety, it does not directly address safety improvements, making it less relevant than passages 3 and 5.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Amid the search, questions emerged about whether the boat, which had four decks and a relatively shallow draft, had been sufficiently stable to withstand stormy weather."}, {"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the work of Stephen Caldwell in evaluating national security programs for Congress, with a focus on maritime security, but does not specifically mention cruise ship safety improvements.", "listwise_reason": "While it provides relevant context about maritime security, it does not directly address cruise ship safety or improvements, making it less relevant than passages 3, 5, and 4.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Stephen Caldwell, an expert on maritime security, has been scrutinizing national security programs for Congress for more than 30 years, visiting and conducting investigations at ports in the U.S. and more than 30 other countries."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage discusses the vulnerability of FAA computers to hackers, which is not directly related to cruise ship safety improvements.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to the other passages, this one is the least relevant as it does not provide any information or context related to cruise ship safety or improvements.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The Federal Aviation Administration has fallen short in its efforts to protect the national air traffic control system from terrorists or others who might try to hack into the computers used to direct planes in flight, according to a government report released Monday."}]}, "scores": [14.38479995727539, 13.444600105285645, 13.065899848937988, 12.131400108337402, 11.7076997756958]}

One judge described the politically motivated mapmaking as \u201cnefarious activity.\u201d But the three-judge panel was divided about whether the contours of the 2011 redistricting plan were the direct cause of longtime GOP Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett\u2019s loss in 2012, and whether officials should literally have to go back to the drawing board before next year\u2019s election. The judges at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore were considering a request for an immediate injunction that would scrap the electoral map at least for one congressional district, which lies mostly in Western Maryland but includes parts of Montgomery County. The hearing centered on the motivations of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment when it redrew boundaries in 2011. Inside the wood-paneled courtroom, lawyers displayed photos and videotaped depositions of top Democratic officials, including Senate President Thomas V. \u201cMike\u201d Miller Jr., House Speaker Michael E. Busch and former governor Martin O\u2019Malley. The half-day session in Baltimore also reflected growing concern nationwide about gerrymandering, which is the subject of a Wisconsin case that is headed to the Supreme Court in the fall term, and which U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar on Friday called a \u201ccancer on our democracy.\u201d Looming over the hearing was a question of timing and how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to take the Wisconsin case will affect the challenge in Maryland, which also seems destined for the high court. The Supreme Court has thrown out state voting maps drawn to weaken the influence of racial minorities, but it has have never settled on a test to measure whether a plan is unconstitutional because of partisan gerrymandering. In the Maryland case, challengers are Republican voters who say they were punished because of their party affiliation and voting record when the Democratically controlled state government intentionally diluted the strength of GOP voters in the 6th District. For two decades, the district was represented by Bartlett. After the lines were redrawn to include more residents from heavily Democratic Montgomery, John Delaney (D) was elected. He still holds the seat. The office of Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), which is defending the plan, said state officials wanted to create a more competitive district, but that the election outcome was far from guaranteed. Assistant Attorney General Sarah Rice told the judges that forcing the state to redraw its electoral map now, less than a year before the 2018 primary, would be \u201cextraordinary.\u201d It would require a special session of the General Assembly, creating confusion for voters and forcing current candidates to \u201ccampaign under a cloud\u201d of uncertainty. Her office wants to delay the lawsuit until after the Supreme Court rules in the Wisconsin case. Even as all three judges accepted what they called substantial and overwhelming evidence of partisan gerrymandering, two of the three seemed deeply skeptical that there were not other factors at work in Bartlett\u2019s defeat. They also questioned the reliability of the measurements political consultants used to shift likely Republican and Democratic voters from one district to another. \u201cCan you prove it? Where\u2019s the concrete evidence that displaced voters would have voted for Bartlett?\u201d U.S. District Judge George L. Russell pressed attorney Michael Kimberly, who represents the challengers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to demonstrate the results would have been different.\u201d Russell and Bredar noted the difficulty of predicting individual voting patterns and pointed to the surprising outcome in the 2016 presidential election, when states that had supported Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 backed Republican Donald Trump. Closer to home, the judges noted the election of Gov. Larry Hogan (R) in 2014 in a state where registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans more than 2-to-1. \u201cIt is an overwhelming case,\u201d said Bredar who had earlier described the redistricting as \u201cnefarious activity.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthat still doesn\u2019t answer the question of whether it worked.\u201d The third judge, Paul V. Niemeyer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, had no problem connecting the dots. \u201cIt seems to me they were highly successful in getting exactly what they wanted,\u201d he said of the Democrats who oversaw redistricting. \u201cThese politicians had the power to make the map the way they wanted it.\u201d An O\u2019Malley spokesman declined to comment but pointed to a speech this year in which the former governor called for redistricting reform and said he believed in 2011 that he should wield his power to favor Democrats. Busch and Miller did not respond to requests for comment. In its brief, the attorney general\u2019s office said there were other reasons for Bartlett\u2019s defeat. At 85, his popularity was waning and he was having trouble raising money, the court filing said. The brief also noted that Delaney came close to being unseated by a Republican challenger in 2014. The judges did not indicate on Friday how quickly they will rule. If either side appeals the outcome, the case goes directly to the Supreme Court, which must either affirm, reverse or accept the case for oral arguments. Robert Barnes contributed to this report.", "Title: State lawyer questions aspects of Hogan\u2019s Md. redistricting plan Content: A lawyer for Maryland\u2019s General Assembly has cast doubt on the legality of Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s proposal to take politics out of the redistricting process by shifting control from the governor and legislature to a nonpartisan commission. The idea of using an independent board to draw voting districts is broadly popular among Marylanders, regardless of demographics and political leanings, according to a recent Goucher College poll. But Assistant Attorney General Kathryn M. Rowe, responding to a request for advice from Sen. Joan Carter Conway (D-Baltimore), said in a letter this month that she has identified 10 legal problems with the proposal by Hogan (R), which would amend the state Constitution to require that a nonpartisan commission handle the redistricting process. The goal of the legislation is to end the practice of gerrymandering, or manipulating legislative and congressional boundaries in ways that give one party an advantage. The March 14 letter from Rowe effectively provides ammunition for Democratic leaders in the legislature who have resisted Hogan\u2019s proposal and called for national redistricting changes that would apply equally to states where Republicans control the legislatures. Hogan\u2019s proposal would have to be approved by the state\u2019s Democratic-majority legislature and by voters to become law. The legislation has stalled at the committee level in the House and Senate, eliciting criticism from Hogan. Rowe, deputy counsel for the General Assembly, said the proposed constitutional amendment, which provides the governor and legislature with no role in the redistricting process, contradicts another section of the bill that says the final map has to be approved by the General Assembly and the state\u2019s chief executive. She also took issue with a provision that would require both chambers of the legislature to approve the commission\u2019s redistricting plans by a three-fifths vote. She said no such supermajority rule can apply to regular bills without a constitutional amendment. Additionally, Rowe said the legislation would restrict the attorney general\u2019s constitutional authority to prosecute or defend the state in all cases pending in Maryland appeals courts and the federal judiciary. The bill would give the nonpartisan panel sole authority for determining who should defend any adopted redistricting plans. Another concern is that the bill would require funding in the state budget to pay for legal defenses of the final redistricting map. Rowe said the provision \u201cdoes not meet the requirements necessary under the Constitution to act as a funding mandate\u201d because it does not prescribe a dollar amount or a specific funding formula. Hogan spokesman Doug Mayer called Rowe\u2019s letter \u201ca feeble attempt to throw up a last-minute smoke screen in front of an important legislative issue.\u201d He said lawmakers could have addressed the issues Rowe raised by adding amendments to the bill, noting, \u201cthat\u2019s what committee hearings are for.\u201d Maryland is home to some of the most gerrymandered voting districts in the nation, according to many analysts. The state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District is notorious for its design, with lines that meander through four counties in the central part of the state with little geographic sense. Republicans have accused the previous governor, Martin O\u2019Malley (D), of further manipulating the system in 2011 when he divided many conservative-leaning counties into multiple districts and shifted left-leaning populations from liberal to more moderate districts, all but ensuring that Democrats would control seven of the state\u2019s eight congressional seats. In Virginia, Democrats say the Republican-controlled legislature has similarly used the redistricting process to its advantage, drawing lines that ensure a lopsided number of GOP congressional representatives. Virginia\u2019s congressional districts are being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. Six states, including California and Arizona, use nonpartisan redistricting commissions to set their voting boundaries.

Aides were dispatched to a private law firm to keep their work out of public view. They employed the most precise technology available to dissect new Census Bureau data and convert it into reliably Republican districts even if the party\u2019s fortunes soured. Democrats were kept in the dark, and even GOP incumbents had to sign confidentiality agreements before their revamped districts were revealed to them. Only a handful of people saw the entire map until it was unveiled and quickly approved. In the following year\u2019s elections, when Republicans got just 48.6 percent of the statewide vote, they still captured a 60-to-39 seat advantage in the State Assembly. Now, the Supreme Court is being asked to uphold a lower court\u2019s finding that the Wisconsin redistricting effort was more than just extraordinary \u2014 it was unconstitutional. Such a conclusion would mark a watershed moment for the way American elections are conducted. The Supreme Court has regularly \u2014 and increasingly \u2014 tossed out state electoral maps because they have been gerrymandered to reduce the influence of racial minorities by depressing the impact of their votes. But the justices have never found a plan unconstitutional because of partisan gerrymandering \u2014 when a majority party draws the state\u2019s electoral districts to give such an advantage to its candidates that it dilutes the votes of those supporting the other party. A divided panel of three judges in Wisconsin, though, decided just that in November. It became the first federal court in three decades to find that a redistricting plan violated the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and equal rights protections because of partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court could announce as soon as next Monday that it is either affirming or reversing the lower court\u2019s decision, or, more likely, accepting the case for full briefing and arguments in the term that begins in the fall. The case comes at a time when the dusty subject of reapportionment has taken on new significance, with many blaming the drawing of safely partisan seats for a polarized and gridlocked Congress. Barack Obama has said that one of his post-presidency projects will be to combat partisan gerrymanders after the 2020 Census. In Wisconsin, it already has become a hot topic. \u201cIf there\u2019s one word that defines the last year or year and a half in this country, it\u2019s \u2018rigged,\u2019 \u201d said Dale Schultz, a Republican and former Wisconsin legislator who has joined with a Democratic counterpart to urge an end to the way the state handles redistricting. \u201cPeople have come to realize their votes aren\u2019t as important as they once were. And that\u2019s really what this whole case is about: It\u2019s about making sure people\u2019s votes have equal value.\u201d Schultz volunteered that he voted for the plan. After some run-ins with leaders of his party, he said he was just glad \u201cthey had not put my district in Iowa.\u201d But he said he saw after the maps were enacted that legislators became more beholden to party leaders because the only real threat to reelection was a primary challenge. Schultz\u2019s Democratic partner in the Fair Elections Project, former state senator Tim Cullen, added that he constantly hears from audiences that if his party had been in charge of the process, it would have done the same thing Republicans did. \u201cAnd, of course, the answer to that is Democrats probably _would_ have done the same thing. But that doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d he said. In fact, a challenge to the way Maryland Democrats drew districts to squeeze out one of the state\u2019s two Republican congressmen is making its way through the courts, and a complaint about partisan gerrymandering by Republicans in North Carolina already is before the justices. Wisconsin\u2019s Republican legislative leaders did not grant interview requests, but in their briefs to the Supreme Court, they said that if their redistricting is unconstitutional, so is that of about one-third of the other states. They asked the justices to reject any effort that \u201cwrests control of districting away from the state legislators to whom the state constitution assigns that task, and hands it to federal judges and opportunistic plaintiffs seeking to accomplish in court what they failed to achieve at the ballot box.\u201d Misha Tseytlin, Wisconsin\u2019s solicitor general who is defending the redistricting plan, said the Republican advantage in the state legislature comes in part because its voters are spread across the state, and because it is winning the battle for voters in the purple state. \u201cI think that political gerrymandering has become a \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say an excuse, but something that a lot of folks who are frustrated by the state-level elections over the last eight years have come to rely on as an excuse,\u201d he said in an interview in the state capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to have a villain than to say, oh, our party isn\u2019t doing well, not selling its message or unfortunately for our party our voters are clustering in major cities.\u201d The Supreme Court has been reluctant to tackle partisan gerrymandering and sort through arguments about whether an electoral system is rigged or, instead, a party\u2019s political advantage is due to changing attitudes and demographics. The justices last took up the topic in 2004 in a case called _Vieth v. Jubelirer_ . It split the court five different ways, with the bottom line being that the justices could not agree on a test to determine when normal political instincts such as protecting your own turned into an unconstitutional dilution of someone else\u2019s vote. Four justices \u2014 only Justice Clarence Thomas remains of the group \u2014 said it was not the court\u2019s business to make such decisions. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the group to decide the specific case against the challengers of a Pennsylvania redistricting plan, but he left the door open for future cases. Kennedy said he could envision a successful challenge \u201cwhere a state enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment.\u201d What was elusive, Kennedy said, was \u201ca manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the state did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a party\u2019s voters.\u201d William Whitford, one of a dozen plaintiffs suing over the Wisconsin plan, said his case, _Gill v. Whitford_ , should be attractive to the Supreme Court: \u201cWe think we have a standard.\u201d Whitford, 77, was born in Madison, Wis. He is a Democratic partisan who lives in an old, left-leaning neighborhood near downtown where, he said, \u201cit would take a genius to put me into a Republican district.\u201d But he and the others in the lawsuit say the statewide partisan gerrymander makes it impossible for him to get the government he wants. \u201cI want to get elected a Democratic majority,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the only chance for me to influence policy.\u201d Whitford and his fellow plaintiffs asked the Wisconsin court to use a new approach to gauge how Republican mapmakers hurt Democrats with the main tools of gerrymandering: \u201cpacking\u201d and \u201ccracking.\u201d These refer to packing like-minded voters, such as supporters of the same party, into a limited number of districts or cracking their influence by scattering them across districts in numbers too small to make an impact. University of Chicago law professor Nicholas O. Stephanopoulos and his political scientist colleague Eric McGhee, of the Public Policy Institute of California, called their theory the \u201cefficiency gap.\u201d Under their approach, every voter packed into a district above the threshold needed to elect a candidate from his party creates a \u201csurplus\u201d vote. And someone in a cracked district, who votes for a candidate that is unable to win, is a \u201clost\u201d vote. Surplus and lost votes are considered wasted votes. The efficiency gap measures the difference between the wasted votes of the two parties in an election divided by the total number of votes cast. In an ideal scenario, where individual votes have as much impact as possible, the efficiency gap would be zero. The gap in Wisconsin was 13.3 percent in 2012. National groups opposed to partisan gerrymandering hail the theory as just the kind of objective test Kennedy said he was looking for. The Wisconsin court was not so definitive. It acknowledged the efficiency gap, but only as one of several theories the court said corroborated its findings that the Republican leadership had a discriminatory intent, that its plan had a discriminatory effect and that the state had no legitimate reason for drawing the districts in the way it did. Tseytlin, the solicitor general, said he finds it \u201cfrustrating\u201d that the efficiency gap has been hailed as a way to scientifically measure gerrymandering and said challengers have backed off their reliance on the theory in their Supreme Court filings. \u201cThe actual standard that the district court used was kind of like a social-science mishmash,\u201d he said. Paul M. Smith, vice president for litigation and strategy at the Campaign Legal Center, which is representing the plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, said his side has not retreated from the idea that the efficiency gap theory could be the test that convinces the Supreme Court but added that it was never meant to be the only gauge. \u201cWe don\u2019t think any one formula has to have some kind of talismanic significance,\u201d Smith said, adding that \u201cthe conclusion that this is one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever done is supported by the evidence \u2014 indeed, it\u2019s compelled by the evidence \u2014 and supported by all of the different measures.\u201d Tseytlin counters that there is plenty of evidence that points to a natural Republican advantage in Wisconsin, where Democratic voters are mostly clustered in Madison and Milwaukee. Because of its history of split government, Wisconsin legislators and governor have been unable to agree on redistricting plans in the past \u2014 the 2011 plan was the first in decades. So the maps had been drawn by federal judges, the \u201cmost nonpolitical way someone could draw a plan,\u201d Tseytlin said. Under those court-drawn plans, Republicans won a majority of Assembly seats in every two-year election cycle since 1994, with the exception of 2008, the year of the Democratic landslide election of Obama. In 1998, Republicans won 49 percent of the statewide vote but 55 of the 99 Assembly seats, he said. In 2004, the party got 50 percent of the vote and won 60 seats. \u201cThe consequences of political gerrymandering in the real world have been greatly exaggerated,\u201d he said. Whitford acknowledged Republicans may have something of a built-in advantage, but the 2011 redistricting plan gives Democrats no chance at all, he said. \u201cI tell people, no harm is going to come from this case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be lucky to get a level playing field. It may be still tilted, just not as tilted.\u201d", "Title: Supreme Court to hear potentially landmark case on partisan gerrymandering Content: The Supreme Court declared Monday that it will consider whether gerrymandered election maps favoring one political party over another violate the Constitution, a potentially fundamental change in the way American elections are conducted. The justices regularly are called to invalidate state electoral maps that have been illegally drawn to reduce the influence of racial minorities by depressing the impact of their votes. But the Supreme Court has long been tolerant of partisan gerrymandering \u2014 and some justices have thought that the court shouldn\u2019t even be involved. A finding otherwise would have a revolutionary impact on the reapportionment that will take place after the 2020 election and could come at the expense of Republicans, who control the process in the majority of states. The court accepted a case from Wisconsin, where a divided panel of three federal judges last year ruled that the state\u2019s Republican leadership in 2011 pushed through a redistricting plan so partisan that it violated the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and equal rights protections. The issue will be briefed and argued during the Supreme Court term that begins in October. The justices gave themselves a bit of an out, saying they will further consider their jurisdiction over the case when it is heard on its merits. And the justices gave an indication of how divisive the issue might be. After granting the case, the court voted 5 to 4 to stay the lower court\u2019s decision, which had required that new state legislative districts be drawn this fall. Wisconsin had argued that would create unnecessary work should the Supreme Court ultimately overturn the lower court\u2019s decision and allow the Republican plan to stand. The liberal justices \u2014 Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 went on record saying they would have denied the stay, meaning that the court\u2019s five conservatives granted it. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who probably holds the key to the case, voted for the stay. The court\u2019s action comes at a time when the relatively obscure subject of reapportionment has taken on new significance, with many blaming the drawing of safely partisan seats for a polarized and gridlocked Congress. Barack Obama has said that one of his post-presidency projects will be to combat partisan gerrymanders after the 2020 Census. Both parties draw congressional and legislative districts to their advantage. A challenge to congressional districts drawn by Maryland Democrats is making its way through the courts. But Republicans have more to lose because they control so many more state legislatures. The Republican National Committee and a dozen large Republican states have asked the court to reverse the decision of the federal court in Wisconsin. That state\u2019s legislative leaders asked the Supreme Court in their brief to reject any effort that \u201cwrests control of districting away from the state legislators to whom the state constitution assigns that task, and hands it to federal judges and opportunistic plaintiffs seeking to accomplish in court what they failed to achieve at the ballot box.\u201d But the dozen plaintiffs \u2014 voters across the state \u2014 said the evidence laid out in a trial in the Wisconsin case showed that \u201cRepublican legislative leaders authorized a secretive and exclusionary mapmaking process aimed at securing for their party a large advantage that would persist no matter what happened in future elections.\u201d In the election held after the new district maps were adopted, Republicans got just 48.6 percent of the statewide vote, but captured a 60-to-39 seat advantage in the State Assembly. The Supreme Court has been reluctant to tackle partisan gerrymandering and sort through arguments about whether an electoral system is rigged or, instead, a party\u2019s political advantage is because of changing attitudes and demographics, as Wisconsin Republicans contend. The justices last took up the topic in 2004 in a case called _Vieth v. Jubelirer,_ which involved a Pennsylvania redistricting plan. The case split the court five ways, with the bottom line being that the justices could not agree on a test to determine when normal political instincts such as protecting your own turned into an unconstitutional dilution of someone else\u2019s vote. Four justices \u2014 only Justice Clarence Thomas remains of the group \u2014 said it was not the court\u2019s business to make such decisions. Four others \u2014 only Ginsburg and Breyer remain \u2014 said such challenges could be heard by the court, but they disagreed on the method. Kennedy was in the middle. He joined the first group in deciding the specific case against the challengers of the Pennsylvania plan, but he left the door open for future cases. Kennedy said he could envision a successful challenge \u201cwhere a state enacts a law that has the purpose and effect of subjecting a group of voters or their party to disfavored treatment.\u201d What was elusive, Kennedy said, was \u201ca manageable standard by which to measure the effect of the apportionment and so to conclude that the state did impose a burden or restriction on the rights of a party\u2019s voters.\u201d In the Wisconsin case, plaintiffs urged the use of a measure called the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d to determine how Republican mapmakers hurt Democrats with the main tools of gerrymandering: \u201cpacking\u201d and \u201ccracking.\u201d These refer to packing like-minded voters, such as supporters of the same party, into a limited number of districts or cracking their influence by scattering them across districts in numbers too small to make an impact. Under the approach, developed by two University of Chicago professors, every voter packed into a district above the threshold needed to elect a candidate from his party creates a \u201csurplus\u201d vote. And someone in a cracked district who votes for a candidate who is unable to win is a \u201clost\u201d vote. Surplus and lost votes are considered wasted votes. The efficiency gap measures the difference between the wasted votes of the two parties in an election divided by the total number of votes cast. The federal court in Wisconsin was not so definitive. It acknowledged the efficiency gap, but only as one of several theories the court said corroborated its findings that the Republican leadership had a discriminatory intent, that its plan had a discriminatory effect and that the state had no legitimate reason for drawing the districts in the way it did. The state contends that while Wisconsin is a purple state in national elections, its geography favors Republicans in legislative elections. Democratic voters are clustered in cities such as Milwaukee and Madison, while Republican voters are more evenly spread across the state. Any method of drawing districts will favor Republicans, they say. The case is _Gill v. Whitford_.", "Title: Supreme Court, with ninth justice, now looks ahead to contentious fall term Content: Three key cases lingered for months on the court\u2019s docket this term as justice waited for a ninth person to join their ranks \u2014 and two other cases, in which justices were tied 4 to 4, will be reargued. Right before Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, the court took three cases -- on immigration, class-action lawsuits and religious rights \u2014 for its 2016-2017 term that, without nine justices, seemed likely to end in a 4-to-4 tie. Usually, the Supreme Court hears arguments in each case in the exact same order as they accepted them, but these cases were different. \u201cThey held them for month after month without arguing them,\u201d said John Elwood, a Washington lawyer who closely watches the court\u2019s deliberations on accepting cases. \u201cThey wanted to see if they could have them argued to the full court.\u201d The court generally wants to avoid 4-4 rulings. \u201cFrom any perspective \u2014 ideological or courts legitimacy \u2014 there\u2019s not a lot to be gained by 4-4 rulings,\u201d Supreme Court scholar Adam Feldman said. This term, the court finished with two 4-to-4 decisions in cases they heard before Neil Gorsuch joined their ranks. The cases ask, respectively, whether those facing deportation be held indefinitely and when immigrants can be deported for crimes. They will be reargued before a full court in their next term. Despite delays, the court decided some significant cases this term. Here\u2019s four of them: Church and state Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer The court ruled 7 to 2 that religious institutions may not be excluded from state programs with a secular intent \u2014 in this case, making playgrounds safer. Trademarks Packingham v. North Carolina The court ruled unanimously that the federal government has violated the First Amendment by refusing to register trademarks that officials consider disparaging, in a decision that provides a boost to the Washington Redskins\u2019 efforts to hang on to the team\u2019s controversial name. Gorsuch did not take part in the decision. Criminal procedure Murr v. Wisconsin The court ruled 5 to 3 to give a second chance to a U.S. permanent resident who pleaded guilty to a drug charge and faces deportation because his lawyer gave him bad advice. Redistricting Cooper v. Harris The court ruled 5 to 3 that North Carolina\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature relied on racial gerrymandering when drawing the state\u2019s congressional districts, a decision that could make it easier to challenge other state redistricting plans. Gorsuch did not take part in the decision. After Gorsuch joined the court, the justices agreed to take up some more contentious issues for the next term, which runs from October 2017 to June 2018. The court will decide whether a warrant is needed to track a suspect through cellphone records and whether Wisconsin Republicans went too far when drawing state legislative districts. They will also decide whether a Denver baker unlawfully discriminated against a gay couple by refusing to sell them a wedding cake in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, a case justices considered a record 14 times before deciding to hear it. Early next term, the court will also consider the president\u2019s broad powers in immigration matters, in a case that raises fundamental issues of national security and religious discrimination. The temporary ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and refugees from all countries was fast-tracked, with the administration asking the courts to take up the issue in early June after lower courts blocked President Trump\u2019s executive order.

Yet after the bills are paid, many people struggle to keep extra cash in the bank. Some 29 percent of people don\u2019t have money set aside to cover emergencies, up from 26 percent last year, according to an annual survey from Bankrate.com. The findings pointed to the lowest saving rates seen in five years. \u201cThis is the money that helps you sleep at night,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com. \u201cYou know if something unplanned arises, you\u2019ve got money squirreled away to cover it.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Many of the people who had savings didn\u2019t have enough money to get them through a serious emergency or prolonged period of unemployment. About 20 percent of people said their savings would not last longer than three months, the amount often recommended by financial planners. At the same time, the number of people with substantial savings is falling. About 22 percent of people had enough cash to cover six months of expenses, the lowest level in five years. Why is it so hard to save? While more people are finding work and earning paychecks, those paychecks haven\u2019t grown much over the past several years, McBride says. Once wages start to grow, that could lead to better saving habits in the near future, he says. Indeed, many people find there\u2019s not much money left over after they\u2019ve paid the bills, according to a separate study by Capital One Bank. About 25 percent of people said they are struggling just to \u201ckeep up with\u201d their monthly bills like the mortgage, car payment and other expenses. One in 10 said they they spend more money than they earn. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Still, people said they would be willing to make some sacrifices to boost their savings. Thirty-four percent of respondents said they would give up air conditioning if it meant having more money in the bank. Some 30 percent said they would give up their smartphones for six months. All of this is easier said than done, of course. But the changes needed to build saving habits don\u2019t have to be drastic. People can start by saving $25 or $50 a month, increasing those amounts as they cut down on expenses elsewhere, says Nicole Lapin, a personal finance author. Others might be more motivated to save if they have a specific goal in mind, like a vacation or a wedding, she says. Saving also gets easier when it\u2019s made automatic, she adds. Once workers know how much they can spare, even if it\u2019s $50 a month, they can have it automatically directed into their saving accounts. Only 21 percent of people surveyed by Capital One had savings withdrawn automatically from their paychecks. **Find more financial tips fromGet There on Instagram.** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico 5 reasons someone making $75,000 would live paycheck to paycheck *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Putting off retirement savings until you make more money is a big mistake *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico 7 foods you\u2019re wasting money on that you could be making at home *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The five money mistakes that are making you poor *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: The financial habits Americans struggle with most Content: The rules that financial pros say people should follow if they want to build wealth are usually straightforward \u2014 pay your bills on time, have cash on hand for a rainy day and invest money for your future. Sounds easy enough, but for many people these milestones can feel out of reach. The slow wage growth we\u2019ve seen since the recession **** means that for many workers, there isn\u2019t much left from the paycheck after covering essentials such as housing, child care and food. Then there are goals such as paying off debt and saving for retirement that can take a back seat, particularly for people struggling with student loans, day-care expenses and high rent. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A slew of surveys and economic reports released recently shed light on how well Americans are handling their money. Wondering where you stand? Take a look: **Debt payments.** Consumers have become much better about paying their bills on time since the recession, with delinquencies for major loan types dropping nearly across the board. This is good news because, as Washington Post columnist Michelle Singletary has said again and again, one of the easiest ways to improve your credit score is to pay your bills on time. The share of closed-end loans, such as car and personal loans, that were late by 30 days or more dropped dramatically in the second quarter to 1.36 percent of accounts, far below the 15-year average of 2.27 percent, according to new data from the American Bankers Association. Closed-end loans are for a set amount, unlike credit cards or lines of credit, which allow balances to change from month to month. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Credit card delinquencies rose slightly to 2.52 percent in the second quarter but were still below the long-term average of 3.74 percent. And the share of people with federal student loans who failed to make loan payments within three years of leaving school is down as more people take advantage of flexible payment options. ~~~~ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Housing costs**. Financial advisers generally recommend that consumers not spend more than a third of their total pay on housing, to free up cash for saving, paying down debt and spending on other necessities. But whether you rent or own, chances are you are struggling to stay under that threshold. About 20.7 million rental households \u2014 or about half of all renters \u2014 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2013, according to a report from the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. For about 11 million of those households, the rent bill ate up more than half of their paycheck. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico (Map: Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. Click here for an interactive version.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The situation is a little different for people who own a home. For homeowners, monthly mortgage payments, including property taxes, mortgage insurance and home insurance, took up about 36.5 percent of the average national wage in the first quarter of 2015, down from 37.4 percent a year earlier, according to a report from RealtyTrac and Clear Capital. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _[The cities where Americans are most likely to spend more than half of their paycheck on rent]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Emergency savings**. If you have any savings, you\u2019re ahead of the game. Some 62 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account, according to a survey of 5,000 consumers by GoBankingRates. That includes 21 percent of those surveyed who said they didn\u2019t even have a savings account. The findings are in line with a similar study by Bankrate.com, which found that 29 percent of people don\u2019t have an emergency fund. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Despite the steady job growth of recent years, many Americans are struggling to save. Financial advisers and economists blame low wage growth, which might make it difficult for families to keep up with rising rent costs and growing child-care expenses. Not surprisingly, people who make more money save a bigger percentage of their pay. People in the bottom 90 percent of the income scale save close to zero percent of their pay each year, while those in the top 10 percent save close to 15 percent of their pay, according to an analysis by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists with the University of California at Berkeley. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But it\u2019s not too late to establish the habit. Financial advisers say people who save with a specific goal in mind \u2014 a vacation, a new car or to buy a home, for instance \u2014 may be more motivated to stick to their plan. Open a separate saving account and have the money funneled into the account automatically on a weekly or daily basis. _[Nearly 30 percent of Americans are one emergency away from financial ruin]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Retirement savings.** People are getting better about saving for retirement. For the first time, the average amount that employees and employers contributed to 401(k)s topped $10,000 this year, according to Fidelity Investments. The numbers show that both sides are putting more funds toward retirement, an important shift as companies continue to move away from pensions and the future of Social Security remains uncertain. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But despite the improvement, many workers are still not saving enough. Many young workers are putting off saving until they\u2019re older and making more money, a mistake that cuts down on how much time their savings have to grow and requires them to save much more later just to catch up. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Some workers who were automatically enrolled into retirement plans also make the mistake of thinking that the default contribution amount chosen by their employer \u2014 which is often as low as 3 percent \u2014 is enough. The average worker saves 8 percent of their pay in a 401(k) plan, according to Fidelity. But financial advisers say people should strive to save up to 10 percent of pay in their 20s, about 15 percent in their 30s, and make the maximum contribution, which is $18,000 this year for 401(k) plans, in their 40s. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico If you aren\u2019t there yet, increase your savings rate as much as you can now and then sign up to have your contributions increase automatically by one or two percentage points each year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Read more:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The five money mistakes that are making you poor *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Need help with money?

For many years after, Kranc bore the guilt of the incident \u2014 until 2009, when he was deployed in Saudi Arabia and decided to get help. \u201cI came to the realization that I could no longer mask this,\u201d Kranc said in a phone interview early Friday with The Post. \u201cI would pour my heart and soul into my professional life, but I would be a zombie at home.\u201d Kranc was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 or what he prefers to simply call \u201cpost-traumatic stress\u201d \u2014 and started seeing a doctor, traveled through Germany, witnessed a leg of the Tour de France. \u201cIt was a personal retreat,\u201d Kranc said. \u201cIt took me a long time to realize that I wasn\u2019t responsible.\u201d Now, the officer, who is currently still serving, shares his story with others in the hopes of destigmatizing PTSD and challenging the idea that war leaves psychological wounds from which it is impossible to recover.

Comparing deployments from previous wars to the enlistment period of the recent conflicts is an apples-to-orange measure, because the circumstances of each war vary widely. For example, during World War II, men and women were enlisted for the duration of the war, plus six months.

Deployment and enlistment for Iraq and Afghanistan varied depending on branch, service and specialty. The initial enlistment of service members is, in fact, 48 months of active duty, as Palin said in her speech. But it is curious to compare that to deployment periods. The typical deployment length is six months for the Air Force, seven months for the Navy and Marine Corps, and one year for the Army. A 2013 Rand Corp. report on Army deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan provides a breakdown of the unique deployment circumstances of its active component members. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico As the report points out, the Army provided the bulk of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, as operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom were predominantly ground operations. The percentage of Army soldiers who were deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan increased over the years of the conflicts. The number of soldiers who were deployed for two or more cumulative years increased significantly between 2008 and 2011. The majority of soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan served up to 24 months. Various estimates of average deployment lengths of this population range from 12 to 18 months. This radar chart provides an illustration of the cumulative deployment periods: There is no doubt that deployment places a strain on families, especially when service members are deployed more than once. But Palin\u2019s statement is an odd one, to compare the enlistment period of recent veterans to the deployment time of veterans of World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Her representatives did not respond to our repeated requests for comment, so we are unsure exactly why she made this point. The intent of the statement appears to be to show the increased toll on military troops from World War II and onward. If so, the basis of this comparison is shaky; circumstances during World War II were so different from the recent conflicts, and there were no standard deployment lengths during World War II. The enlistment requirement was for the duration of the war plus six months, and troops were deployed until the field commanders decided when combat fatigue was affecting their duties. When Palin talks about the enlistment period of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, it seems like a huge jump from six months in World War II to 45 months. But the average deployment period of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans ranges from 12 to 18 months. So her statement is misleading.

Most flights out of this South American nation are booked solid months ahead because locals buy up tickets to enable the purchase of dollars at a preferential rate. In a phenomenon Venezuelans have dubbed \u201ccurrency tourism,\u201d many do not even bother taking the trips, meaning planes often fly out half empty. People sell their dollar allowances on the black market for a profit of up to seven times their official worth. Stung by a barrage of headlines on the subject, officials said this weekend that they planned to put fingerprint machines at airports, ports and borders to identify the no-show scammers. Only after people registered at those machines would their hard-currency allowance be activated, the immigration service SAIME said in a statement. \u201cDollars have to be used to feed the national economy, not to speculate with,\u201d SAIME head Juan Carlos Dugarte said, adding that his organization was working with state currency board Cadivi to stop the scam. The surge in \u201ccurrency tourism\u201d has been added to annual inflation of 45 percent, frequent blackouts and shortages of basics such as toilet paper and milk as another symbol of the economic problems piling up here. Maduro narrowly won a vote this year to replace Hugo Ch \u00e1 vez, who died of cancer, but he has been struggling to deal with Venezuelans\u2019 grass-roots problems, forge his own political identity and keep the ruling Socialist Party united. Ch \u00e1 vez introduced currency controls a decade ago, and the disparity between the official price of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar and the illegal black- market rate, which is nearly seven times higher, is wider than at any point since then. There are strict limits on the availability of dollars at the official rate, but with a valid airline ticket Venezuelans may exchange up to $3,000 at that rate. They profit from that using their credit cards in an arbitrage process known as \u201cel raspao,\u201d or \u201cthe scrape.\u201d Either they use credit cards abroad to obtain a cash advance which they then carry home, or they send their cards to friends overseas who swipe the cards and send the cash back. Sometimes people fly abroad carrying multiple cards of friends and relatives that they \u201cscrape\u201d during their travels. Critics of Maduro, led by opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost the April presidential election by 1.5 percentage points, say failed socialist economics and mismanagement are to blame for this and a host of other economic distortions. But the government alleges that a silent \u201ceconomic war\u201d is being waged by rich opponents who are encouraged by the United States. Maduro expelled three U.S. diplomats last week over the issue and has promised to \u201cradicalize\u201d government in response. The scramble for airline tickets has led to a huge rise in prices, often double or triple what they were a few months back. The consumer group Anauco criticized the plan to introduce fingerprint machines as \u201cimprovised and uncomfortable\u201d for honest travelers, saying authorities could easily identify the no-shows by cross-referencing travel data and flight manifests with registers held by Cadivi. \u201cOur airports often collapse anyway due to the normal security processes, so we can ill afford a new measure or possible queue before boarding,\u201d it said. Economists are clamoring for an easing of the foreign-exchange system to stop problems like \u201ccurrency tourism.\u201d \u201cNothing is going to work unless you attack the root problem: reducing the gap between the official and parallel rate, or at least making it manageable,\u201d said Asdr \u00fa bal Oliveros, of the local think tank Ecoanal \u00ed tica. ** \u2014 Reuters **", "Title: Who\u2019s logging your face?

Yet, one by one, over the past 15 years, 29 states have done something similar with our faces: They have allowed police or the FBI to use face-recognition technology to scan and search drivers\u2019 faces for investigations \u2014 much like they would the fingerprints of criminals. In this way, most American adults can find themselves in a criminal face- recognition network. In 1892, Sir Francis Galton published a treatise in which he argued that the patterns on our fingers were \u201can incomparably surer criterion of identity than any other bodily feature.\u201d Today, fingerprinting is ubiquitous. But the limits of the technique are clear: Fingerprinting is a targeted, one-off process whereby a single person is identified, typically through an in-person or on- site interaction. Advanced face recognition, on the other hand, lets police identify people from far away and without interacting with them. It also lets them remotely identify groups of people. Picture police using telescope-like cameras to surreptitiously photograph and identify organized-crime figures at a meeting. Imagine a street surveillance camera that scans the face of every person walking by. Now, picture a world in which body-worn police cameras are equipped with real-time face-scanning software. This is real technology \u2014 on sale, in use or coming soon. These tools will catch dangerous criminals, but, left unchecked, they also create profound questions about the future of our society. Will you attend a protest if you know the government can secretly scan your face and identify you \u2014 as police in Baltimore did during the Freddie Gray protests? Do you have the right to walk down your street without having your face scanned? If you don\u2019t, will you lead your life in the same way? Will you go to a psychiatrist? A marriage counselor? An Alcoholics Anonymous meeting? In the future, will you call the police if, seconds after seeing you, an officer\u2019s body camera will scan your face and search it against various government databases? What if you have a criminal record? What if you have overstayed your visa? In scope, law-enforcement face-recognition systems recall the National Security Agency\u2019s call-records program, which logged all of our calls in the form of metadata. Face-recognition technology already scans some 125 million adult faces. This has never happened before \u2014 not with DNA or fingerprints, which are kept in smaller national networks made up mostly of known or suspected criminals. Yet law-enforcement face-recognition systems have received a fraction of the NSA\u2019s oversight. No federal law governs face recognition. No court decision limits it. On Wednesday morning, a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will mark only the second congressional hearing on the subject. Over 4\u00bd years, the FBI searched drivers\u2019 faces more than 36,000 times \u2014 without warrants, audits or regular accuracy tests. Maryland and Ohio enrolled all of their drivers\u2019 faces into criminal face-recognition networks without telling them. In Florida, the oldest and perhaps most frequently used system lets police search someone\u2019s face even if that person is not suspected of a crime. In fact, officers are encouraged to use face recognition \u201cwhenever practical.\u201d This rules-free environment is made worse by the fact that face-recognition technology makes mistakes \u2014 far more than fingerprints. A 2012 study co- written by an FBI expert found that face recognition makes more mistakes when searching for the faces of African Americans, women and young people. Depending on how a system is configured, these errors could result in innocent people being investigated. You may brush off modern privacy invasions. Perhaps you have nothing to hide. But do you resemble someone who does? **Read more on this topic:** Alan Charles Raul: After NSA revelations, a privacy czar is needed Radley Balko: Police cameras are a tool.

Using a new system called MasterCard Identity Check -- or, colloquially, \"selfie pay\" -- the credit card company will use biometric methods like face recognition and fingerprint scans to better **** secure online shopping. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Right now, Mastercard offers a feature that financial institutions can enable that lets customers set up a password for online payments to help prevent fraud. The new system will use the same principle, but instead of relying on a password that could be forgotten or stolen, it uses your face or fingerprint. Consumers will go through all the normal steps of filling out credit card information when making an online purchase, but this feature adds another step: The website will send a notification through an app on customers' smartphones that asks them to verify their identity. This can be done either through a fingerprint scan or by using the phone's camera to take a brief, selfie-like, video. When taking the \"selfie,\" the user will have to blink to prove that it's a live person and not just an old photo being used to spoof the system. MasterCard started testing the feature with nearly 1,000 consumers in the United States and the Netherlands last year. It plans to make it more broadly available through partnered banks this summer in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and potentially other markets. Various smart wallet systems, including Apple Pay, already use fingerprint scans to let customers prove their identities when making purchases. Last year, USAA -- a financial services company that offers banking to members of the armed forces and their families -- rolled out a feature that lets customers use a similar blinking selfie test or voice recognition to log into their mobile banking app. And HSBC will soon roll out tech that offers fingerprints and voice recognition to help identify patrons of a U.K. subsidiary. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The rise of biometrics comes as managing multiple passwords has become overwhelming for users and driven them to poor digital hygiene practices, such as reusing passwords. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But using things like fingerprints and facial recognition tech to verify identities comes with its own set of risks. For one, they generally aren't secrets: Your face is probably plastered all over social media profiles and captured by many different surveillance cameras every day while you leave fingerprints on almost everything you touch. Biometrics are also permanent: If a password gets compromised, you can change it -- but it's much harder, if not practically impossible, for most people to change their face or fingerprints. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That means that when entities like MasterCard start using biometric techniques for verification purposes, it's extra important that the information stay secure -- which the company says it will ensure through data protection measures such as encryption. The fingerprint data will be processed and stored locally on the device, according to MasterCard. For facial recognition, users will snap an initial photo of their face that will be converted into a string of 0s and 1s. The original image will be destroyed, but the digitized protected version will be stored and matched to the blinking selfies to verify a user's identity. \"We are currently prototyping facial recognition to be converted and stored as encrypted code on the device as part of the MasterCard Identity Check rollout,\" said Jane Khodos, a vice president for communications at MasterCard.", "Title: Google announces new Nexus phones, a new tablet and lots of updates Content: Google showed off a wide range of new devices and services on Tuesday in a jam-packed press conference that revealed its fall lineup of products. Here is a quick rundown of what the company announced: **Nexus 5X:** The Nexus 5X is an LG-made phone that should appeal to folks who may want a phone that's a little bit smaller than some of the ever-growing flagships out there. The phone has a 5.2-inch screen and will run the newest version of Android \u2014 of course! \u2014 which is called Marshmallow. It also has Google's new branded fingerprint scanner technology, called Nexus Imprint. The Nexus 5X is compatible with Google's Project Fi service, as well as other carriers and starts at $379 for 16GB. It's available for pre-order now and will ship sometime in October. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Nexus 6P:** Moving on to larger screen size, the 6P is 5.7-inch phone made in partnership with Huawei, and the first all-metal phone in the Nexus lineup. (Hey, these things matter to people.) The phone has an aluminum case and also has a fingerprint sensor and charges with USB-C. With a 64-bit processor, 12.3 MP rear-facing camera and 8 MP front-facing camera, this is a high-performance phone. And Google was happy to show off its photography prowess \u2014 claiming that it takes better low-light photos than the Apple iPhone 6s Plus. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The phone is also compatible with Google's Project Fi service. So you can go full Google with this phone as well; it starts at $499 for a 32 GB model. It will also ship in October, according to the presentation. Google also added slow-motion video capabilities to both phones; both can also shoot 4K video. **Pixel C:** Like Microsoft's Surface or Apple's iPad Pro, Google's new tablet is designed to double as a laptop replacement, with the addition of a separately sold keyboard. But it has a few differences. For one, you can charge the keyboard inductively, and you can also store it on the back of the tablet itself through the power of magnets. The Pixel C has a 10.1-inch display and charges using USB-C as well. It also boasts some pretty impressive internals: 3 GB of RAM, plus an Nvidia X1 quad-core processor and Maxwell GPU. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Google mostly just teased this tablet, which starts at $499. The keyboard will cost $149. Google promised to reveal more about it soon, ahead of a release that should come \"before the holidays.\" **Google Play Music and Google Photos:** On the services side, Google announced that up to six people will be able to log into one account for their music for $14.99 per month. Right now it costs $9.99 per person, so that's a pretty significant deal. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico On the Photos front, Google also showed off easier ways to share pictures across iOS and Android devices through cloud albums and the ability to add private labels to people who show up frequently in your photos. (So you can call your grandmother \"Memaw\" rather than \"Ethel.\") You should be able to search through your pictures using this facial recognition. That adds on Photos' existing search features, so you can run a query for something like, \"Uncle Jack hiking\" to get the right picture. The other big announcement here is that you'll be able to show off Google Photos to your television, via Chromecast. **Chromecast** : Speaking of Chromecast, the little streaming device you plug into your TV's HDMI port, Google's given the device a full makeover. Rather than looking like a USB drive, the new Chromecast is round, more compact and comes in a few colors. It's also still $35. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Google also announced a new product called Chromecast Audio, which plugs in to any existing speaker to stream music. So if you have some old speakers lying around and wish you could make them smart, Chromecast Audio promises to let you do that \u2014 just plug that standard audio jack into the new device \u2014 which has a round, grooved design that's a flashback to vinyl. The Chromecast app also gets a makeover, making it more useful for content discovery rather than just a tool for setting up and managing your Chromecast. It displays content from apps that are installed on your phones. And it shows you all the apps on your phone that work with Chromecast, while also supporting voice search on Android and iOS devices.", "Title: The heartbeat vs. the fingerprint in the battle for biometric authentication Content: If there\u2019s one thing the technology world loves, it\u2019s the battle over competing standards. Ever since the showdown between VHS and Betamax in the late 1970s, the battle over standards has repeated itself over and over again, as new emerging technologies attempt to convince consumers to adopt them instead of another. Think of the Browser Wars or the current battle between Android and Apple iOS. The next big battle over standards could be between the fingerprint and the heartbeat as the preferred form of biometric authentication. Currently, of course, the fingerprint \u2014 via innovations such as Apple\u2019s Touch ID \u2014 reigns supreme as the premier way to authenticate digital devices. This makes sense, given that fingerprints are used universally as a form of authentication. They have been used for more than 100 years to identify people (mostly criminals). Researchers have shown that a person\u2019s fingerprints do not change over time, except in extreme circumstances (like leprosy). And, in the analysis of billions of sets of fingerprints, there has never been found an exact match between two individuals. In that regard, they\u2019re like snowflakes \u2013 no two are alike. From that perspective, it\u2019s a no-brainer that companies such as Apple have embraced fingerprint authentication for digital devices for security purposes. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But here comes the heartbeat. In 2013, Toronto-based Bionym created the Nymi wearable wristband, which uses an embedded electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor to recognize the unique cardiac rhythm of users. This ECG sensor is able to match the wearer\u2019s ECG against a stored profile in order to authenticate the wearer\u2019s identity. If the heartbeats match, you\u2019re good to go. As Kurt Bartlett, marketing and public relations manager at Bionym, told me in a phone conversation, the science is based on nearly a decade of R&D; work at the University of Toronto, where researchers first began investigating an ECG biometric algorithm. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And now this year, the company is launching a first-of-its-kind pilot of a biometric payment system. The trial, which involves MasterCard and Royal Bank of Canada, will use a Nymi wristband linked to a MasterCard credit card for payments. An NFC chip inside the wristband will make it possible to communicate wirelessly with payment terminals, while the ECG sensor will make it possible to authenticate users. Bionym refers to it as the \u201cworld\u2019s first biometrically authenticated wearable payment solution.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So is heartbeat authentication really better than fingerprint authentication? According to Bionym, there are two primary advantages of heartbeat authentication over fingerprint authentication: one is linked to security and one to convenience. As the company\u2019s November 2013 white paper explains in greater detail, the security feature derives from the fact that a user\u2019s ECG cannot be lifted or captured without a person\u2019s consent. Contrast that to fingerprints, which leave behind \u201clatent samples\u201d (i.e. smudges) that can be replicated or forged. The ECG sensor is internal, meaning that it\u2019s much harder to capture a user\u2019s identity. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In terms of convenience, the Nymi only requires a user to confirm their identity once a day rather than swiping a finger for each and every transaction. Once a user has been authenticated, he or she will have continuous and reliable access to services and devices via wireless communication. Moreover, the ECG sensor is able to collect a signal continuously until it finds a match, which solves the problem of having to replace your finger on a device if it does not read it correctly the first time around. And indeed, if you watch the Nymi product videos, it does appear that services and devices unlock almost as if by magic. If you\u2019re wearing a Nymi wristband, you literally do not need to put down your cup of coffee in order to unlock your smartphone \u2013 it recognizes who you are and unlocks by itself. There\u2019s obviously a new and growing market for biometric identification \u2013 and that\u2019s precisely why it\u2019s relevant to be talking about a standards war. Just think of the numerous times each day we\u2019re asked to authenticate things around us with passwords. And now that mobile payments are becoming mainstream, just think of how many times we will be asked to authenticate these transactions each day. In fact, according to a recent JWT report on the future of payments, there will be 471 million global biometrics smartphone users by 2017. That\u2019s a huge potential market. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Right now, the Nymi is still only available for pre-order and only a limited number of developers have been able to work with the Nymi wristband, so we don\u2019t know how effective it will be in practice. However, if the heartbeat authentication pilot with MasterCard is successful, this potentially sets up a broader standards battle with Apple, which is heavily touting its Touch ID fingerprint identification system as the way to authenticate Apple Pay transactions. According to Apple, your finger \u2014 not your heartbeat \u2014 is \u201cthe perfect password.\u201d Apple has the first-mover advantage since everyone knows about Touch ID, and nobody knows about what might be called heartbeat ID. And Apple also has an advantage because of its huge installed iPhone and iPad customer base. As a result, fingerprints \u2014 not heartbeats \u2014 are the de facto industry standard for authenticating digital devices, digital services and mobile payment transactions. But there are signs that the heartbeat could steal a beat on the fingerprint. In September, Bionym raised a $14 million round of venture capital investment and brought aboard MasterCard and SAP as new partners. The company is also reaching out to hospitality providers in order to convince them to use heartbeat identification as the way to recognize users. They\u2019re hoping to license the heartbeat recognition technology to others, so that it can become a new standard for all wearable devices. Finally, they\u2019re opening up to developers, asking them to design around the technology. Whereas Apple has been cautious about sharing too much of its technology with others, Bionym wants to get its technology onto as many wrists as possible. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But as much as this potential battle over biometric authentication is about the size of the customer base and first-mover advantage, it\u2019s also about something much deeper \u2013 what we fundamentally consider to make us human. If someone asked you to define the one aspect of your physical identity that made you unique, you might say your \u201cface\u201d or your \u201ceyes\u201d or your \u201cfingerprint.\u201d And, not surprisingly, other biometric authentication schemes that have been proposed have used facial recognition and iris scans. The heart may be the subject of some of the world\u2019s great poetry, but until recently, there has never been a reliable ECG biometric algorithm. In fact, you might not even realize that your heart\u2019s cardiac rhythm could be used to identify yourself. There\u2019s still a lot to be done with using heartbeats for biometric authentication, of course. Products available for pre-order are not the same as products already in the marketplace. But given that Apple is already thinking in terms of the Heartbeat for the Apple Watch and more wearable devices seem to be coming with built-in heart rate monitors (which measure blood flow, not electrical activity), we might just see the heartbeat gain ground in its battle with the fingerprint. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 1, "direct_reason": "The passage discusses the use of fingerprint machines at airports to identify no-show scammers, which is directly related to the query about using face or fingerprint to replace plane tickets.", "listwise_reason": "Compared to other passages, this one provides the most direct and relevant information about the use of biometric data (fingerprint) in the context of air travel.", "direct_answer_sentence": "President Nicol \u00e1 s Maduro\u2019s government plans to use fingerprint machines at airports to try to root out no-shows who buy tickets to scam currency controls, in the latest symptom of Venezuela\u2019s economic chaos."}, {"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "The passage talks about MasterCard using face recognition and fingerprint scans for secure online shopping, which is somewhat related to the query as it involves biometric data for verification.", "listwise_reason": "Although the context is not air travel, it still discusses the use of face and fingerprint data for identity verification, making it more relevant than passages 2, 4, and 5.", "direct_answer_sentence": "Using a new system called MasterCard Identity Check -- or, colloquially, 'selfie pay' -- the credit card company will use biometric methods like face recognition and fingerprint scans to better secure online shopping."}, {"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "The passage discusses the use of face-recognition technology by police or the FBI, which is indirectly related to the query as it involves the use of face data, but not in the context of air travel or ticket replacement.", "listwise_reason": "While the context is not directly related to the query, the passage does discuss the use of face data for identification, making it more relevant than passages 4 and 5.", "direct_answer_sentence": "They have allowed police or the FBI to use face-recognition technology to scan and search drivers\u2019 faces for investigations \u2014 much like they would the fingerprints of criminals."}, {"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "The passage mentions Google's new branded fingerprint scanner technology, Nexus Imprint, but it does not discuss its use in the context of air travel or ticket replacement.", "listwise_reason": "Although the passage mentions fingerprint technology, it does not provide information on its application in the context of the query, making it less relevant than passages 1, 2, and 3.", "direct_answer_sentence": "It also has Google's new branded fingerprint scanner technology, called Nexus Imprint."}, {"identifier": 5, "direct_reason": "The passage discusses the competition between fingerprint and heartbeat as forms of biometric authentication, but it does not mention their use in the context of air travel or ticket replacement.", "listwise_reason": "While the passage discusses biometric authentication, it does not provide information on its application in the context of the query, making it the least relevant among the passages.", "direct_answer_sentence": "The next big battle over standards could be between the fingerprint and the heartbeat as the preferred form of biometric authentication."}]}, "scores": [11.52929973602295, 11.038200378417969, 10.958800315856934, 10.840999603271484, 10.642800331115723]}

He was also equipped with magazines that held 30 bullets each. Advocates of stricter gun control argue that it shouldn't be so easy to have access to weapons that powerful \u2014 or to magazines capable of holding so many bullets. And so, on Sunday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she would introduce new legislation to ban assault weapons at the start of the next Congress. President Obama has also said that he'd support a federal ban. But how much would this legislation do? Back in 1994, Congress passed a federal assault-weapons ban that lasted 10 years. Experts who have studied the law tend to agree that it was rife with loopholes and generally ineffective at curbing gun violence \u2014 though it might well have reduced mass shootings. Here's a look at what the 1994 law actually did, where it failed, and whether it could be reworked to significantly reduce gun violence. **What counts as an \"assault weapon\"?** The trouble all starts here. There's no technical definition of an \"assault weapon.\" There are _fully automatic_ weapons, which fire continuously when the trigger is held down. Those have been strictly regulated since 1934. Then there are _semiautomatic_ weapons that reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed. Semiautomatic pistols and rifles come in all shapes and sizes and are extremely common in the United States. Congress didn't want to ban all semiautomatic weapons \u2014 that would ban most guns, period. So, in crafting the 1994 ban, lawmakers mainly focused on 18 specific firearms, as well as certain military-type features on guns. Complicated flow charts laid it all out. Certain models of AR-15s and AK-47s were banned. Any semiautomatic rifle with a pistol grip and a bayonet mount was an \"assault weapon.\" But a semiautomatic rifle with just a pistol grip might be okay. It was complicated. And its complexity made it easy to evade. **What did the 1994 ban actually do?** For the 10 years that the ban was in effect, it was illegal to manufacture the assault weapons described above for use by private citizens. The law also set a limit on high-capacity magazines \u2014 these could now carry no more than 10 bullets. There was, however, an important exception. Any assault weapon or magazine that was manufactured _before_ the law went into effect in 1994 was perfectly legal to own or resell. That was a huge exception: At the time, there were roughly 1.5 million assault weapons and more than 24 million high-capacity magazines in private hands. **Did the 1994 law have loopholes?** Yes, lots. Even after the ban took effect, it was not difficult for someone to get their hands on an assault weapon or high-capacity magazine. A 2004 University of Pennsylvania study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice explained why. For starters, only 18 firearm models were explicitly banned. But it was easy for gun manufacturers to modify weapons slightly so that they didn't fall under the ban. One example: the Colt AR-15 that James Holmes used to shoot up a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer would have been outlawed. Yet it would have been perfectly legal for Holmes to have purchased a very similar Colt Match Target rifle, which didn't fall under the ban. Meanwhile, here were already more than 24 million large-capacity magazines in existence before the federal ban took effect in 1994. Indeed, as soon as Congress began working on the law, manufacturers boosted production of weapons and magazines in anticipation of higher prices. Dangerous weapons were still plentiful. **Did the law have an effect on crime or gun violence?** While gun violence did fall in the 1990s, this was likely due to other factors. Here's the UPenn study again: \"We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation\u2019s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.\" One reason is that assault weapons were never a huge factor in gun violence to begin with. They were used in only 2 percent to 8 percent of gun crimes. Large-capacity magazines were more important \u2014 used in as many as a quarter of gun crimes. But, again, the 1994 law left more than 24 million magazines untouched, so the impact was blunted. **Did the law have an effect on mass shootings?** That's possible, though not certain. As this chart from Princeton's Sam Wang shows, the number of people killed in mass shootings did go down in the years the ban was in effect (save for a surge in 1999, a year that included Columbine): Because mass shootings are relatively rare, it's difficult to tell whether this was just a random blip or caused by the ban. Still, the number of mass shootings per year has doubled since the ban expired. That's suggestive, at least. **Why did the ban lift in 2004?** The **** original assault weapons law was written so that it would expire after ten years. When 2004 came around, some Democrats tried to renew it, but there wasn't much interest in Congress. A few states, including New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey, still have their own versions of the law on the books. **Could the ban have worked if it had lasted longer?** In his 2004 assessment of the law, the University of Pennsylvania's Christopher Koper argued that any federal ban would likely take many years to have an effect, thanks to all the exemptions. If Congress actually managed to reduce the number of high-capacity magazines, that might slightly reduce the number of gunshot victims. But, Koper added, the research here was fairly thin and any predictions were \"tenuous.\" **Would it be possible to tighten the law?** In theory, yes. Back in 1996, Australia imposed a much stricter version of the assault weapons ban after a mass shooting. The Australian version avoided many of the loopholes in the U.S. law: Not only did the country ban all types of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, but it also spent $500 million buying up nearly 600,000 existing guns from private owners. As Wonkblog's Sarah Kliff pointed out, Australia's law appears to have curbed gun violence. Researchers in the British Medical Journal __write that the ban was \u201cfollowed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides.\u201d Still, an Australia-style ban would face much more difficult hurdles in this country. For starters, there are more than 200 million guns in circulation in the United States, making a buyback much more costly. And a full ban would likely face heavier resistance here, both from the courts and the public. Even Feinstein has promised that her new version of the assault weapons ban would still \"exempt over 900 specific weapons.\" Gun-control advocates aren't quite ready to propose overly sweeping measures. **Related:** Twelve facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States.", "Title: Everything you need to know about the assault weapons ban, in one post Content: When Adam Lanza shot 26 people in Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday, police say he largely relied on a Bushmaster AR-15 \"assault-type weapon,\" a semiautomatic rifle that could rapidly fire multiple high-velocity rounds.

So, in crafting the 1994 ban, lawmakers mainly focused on 18 specific firearms, as well as certain military-type features on guns. Complicated flow charts laid it all out. Certain models of AR-15s and AK-47s were banned. Any semiautomatic rifle with a pistol grip and a bayonet mount was an \"assault weapon.\" But a semiautomatic rifle with just a pistol grip might be okay. It was complicated. And its complexity made it easy to evade. **What did the 1994 ban actually do?** For the 10 years that the ban was in effect, it was illegal to manufacture the assault weapons described above for use by private citizens. The law also set a limit on high-capacity magazines \u2014 these could now carry no more than 10 bullets. There was, however, an important exception. Any assault weapon or magazine that was manufactured _before_ the law went into effect in 1994 was perfectly legal to own or resell. That was a huge exception: At the time, there were roughly 1.5 million assault weapons and more than 24 million high-capacity magazines in private hands. **Did the 1994 law have loopholes?** Yes, lots. Even after the ban took effect, it was not difficult for someone to get their hands on an assault weapon or high-capacity magazine. A 2004 University of Pennsylvania study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice explained why. For starters, only 18 firearm models were explicitly banned. But it was easy for gun manufacturers to modify weapons slightly so that they didn't fall under the ban. One example: the Colt AR-15 that James Holmes used to shoot up a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer would have been outlawed. Yet it would have been perfectly legal for Holmes to have purchased a very similar Colt Match Target rifle, which didn't fall under the ban. Meanwhile, here were already more than 24 million large-capacity magazines in existence before the federal ban took effect in 1994. Indeed, as soon as Congress began working on the law, manufacturers boosted production of weapons and magazines in anticipation of higher prices. Dangerous weapons were still plentiful. **Did the law have an effect on crime or gun violence?** While gun violence did fall in the 1990s, this was likely due to other factors. Here's the UPenn study again: \"We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation\u2019s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.\" One reason is that assault weapons were never a huge factor in gun violence to begin with. They were used in only 2 percent to 8 percent of gun crimes. Large-capacity magazines were more important \u2014 used in as many as a quarter of gun crimes. But, again, the 1994 law left more than 24 million magazines untouched, so the impact was blunted. **Did the law have an effect on mass shootings?** That's possible, though not certain. As this chart from Princeton's Sam Wang shows, the number of people killed in mass shootings did go down in the years the ban was in effect (save for a surge in 1999, a year that included Columbine): Because mass shootings are relatively rare, it's difficult to tell whether this was just a random blip or caused by the ban. Still, the number of mass shootings per year has doubled since the ban expired. That's suggestive, at least. **Why did the ban lift in 2004?** The **** original assault weapons law was written so that it would expire after ten years. When 2004 came around, some Democrats tried to renew it, but there wasn't much interest in Congress. A few states, including New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey, still have their own versions of the law on the books. **Could the ban have worked if it had lasted longer?** In his 2004 assessment of the law, the University of Pennsylvania's Christopher Koper argued that any federal ban would likely take many years to have an effect, thanks to all the exemptions. If Congress actually managed to reduce the number of high-capacity magazines, that might slightly reduce the number of gunshot victims. But, Koper added, the research here was fairly thin and any predictions were \"tenuous.\" **Would it be possible to tighten the law?** In theory, yes. Back in 1996, Australia imposed a much stricter version of the assault weapons ban after a mass shooting. The Australian version avoided many of the loopholes in the U.S. law: Not only did the country ban all types of semiautomatic rifles and shotguns, but it also spent $500 million buying up nearly 600,000 existing guns from private owners. As Wonkblog's Sarah Kliff pointed out, Australia's law appears to have curbed gun violence. Researchers in the British Medical Journal __write that the ban was \u201cfollowed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides.\u201d Still, an Australia-style ban would face much more difficult hurdles in this country. For starters, there are more than 200 million guns in circulation in the United States, making a buyback much more costly. And a full ban would likely face heavier resistance here, both from the courts and the public. Even Feinstein has promised that her new version of the assault weapons ban would still \"exempt over 900 specific weapons.\" Gun-control advocates aren't quite ready to propose overly sweeping measures. **Related:** Twelve facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States.", "Title: History of gun control is cautionary tale for those who want more regulations Content: At 3 a.m. on July 2, 1993, Steve Sposato sat down in his darkened living room to write, by hand, a letter to the president of the United States. His life had just been shattered. Hours earlier, in the afternoon, a deranged man armed with semiautomatic weapons had gone on a rampage, slaughtering eight people at an office building in downtown San Francisco. The gunman\u2019s motive would remain forever a mystery. Among the slain: Steve\u2019s wife, 30-year-old Jody Jones Sposato, the mother of his 10-month-old daughter, Meghan. His anguished letter to the president asked how it was possible for someone to possess rapid-fire weapons with 30-round magazines, seemingly designed to kill as many people as possible as quickly as possible. \u201cNow I\u2019m left to raise my 10-month-old daughter on my own,\u201d he told the president. \u201cHow do I find the strength to carry on?\u201d That letter reached President Bill Clinton. The next year, Sposato stood by Clinton\u2019s side in the Rose Garden as the president demanded that Congress pass a ban on assault weapons, such as the TEC-9s used to kill Sposato\u2019s wife. Sposato testified on the Hill wearing little Meghan on his back in a baby carrier. With some moderate Republicans joining the Democratic majority, both houses of Congress passed a 10-year ban on the sale of assault weapons and large ammunition magazines. An attempt to extend the ban in 2004 died in Congress amid opposition from the gun lobby. Now gun control has roared back into the national conversation as the country reels from the horror in Newtown, Conn. President Obama and his fellow Democrats are vowing to pass a new assault weapons ban, along with other new laws to strengthen background checks on gun purchasers and limit the size of ammunition magazines. But although Newtown has supercharged the conversation on how to stop another massacre, the history of gun control is a cautionary tale for those who push for more regulations. If past is prologue, the legislative fights ahead will be protracted and brutal \u2014 and any resulting legislation may well be riddled with loopholes. There is no uncontested ground here. Few issues in the country are as polarized as gun control. The ideological chasm was on full display in Washington on Friday when the National Rifle Association\u2019s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, held a take-no-prisoners news conference in which he called for a federal program to put armed guards in every school in the country, saying, \u201cThe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d He said laws making schools gun-free zones have backfired: \u201cThey tell every insane killer in America that schools are the safest place to inflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk.\u201d LaPierre\u2019s remarks were twice interrupted by protesters; one held a sign saying, \u201cNRA Killing Our Kids.\u201d The news conference provided a reminder that gun policy is a central feature of what is loosely known as the culture wars. The gun-control and gun-rights camps don\u2019t even speak the same language, with one side arguing that the Second Amendment can\u2019t possibly mean the right to own an assault weapon, while the other side says \u201cassault weapon\u201d is a pejorative invented by an urban elite that wouldn\u2019t know an AR-15 from an AK-47. The lack of common ground on this issue doesn\u2019t preclude action. This time could be different, because Newtown and other mass shootings in recent months have exerted a powerful torque on the American conscience. But the basic rule on gun legislation is that nothing comes easy. The historical pattern is striking: First comes a shocking event, then calls for action, then prolonged legislative battles, and at the end of it all a new law might come crawling out of Congress so enfeebled by exemptions that it has limited effect in the real world. The classic example is that very same 1994 assault weapons ban advocated by Steve Sposato and Clinton and referenced frequently in recent days as a legislative landmark. The law defined \u201cassault weapon\u201d narrowly, outlawing the sale of 19 brands of semiautomatic firearms, including certain guns built on the AR-15 design, which is the civilian version of the military\u2019s M-16. To be banned, a gun had to have two or more military-style features, such as a pistol grip, a flash suppressor or a bayonet mount. Manufacturers found work-arounds, modifying their designs to comply with the law. \u201cThere were so many ways around the ban that it wasn\u2019t really effective,\u201d said John W. Magaw, who ran the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) during that time. The 1994 assault weapons ban was prospective, not retroactive. It didn\u2019t outlaw the sale of assault weapons that had already been manufactured. And if you owned such a gun, you could keep it. By 1994, the country was already saturated with semiautomatic rifles and handguns. There are now millions of such guns in circulation. The AR-15-style weapons have become extraordinarily popular \u2014 hyped by gun publications and online advertisements. They\u2019ve been mainstreamed, in effect. Connecticut has an assault weapons ban, modeled on the 1994 law. The Connecticut law also has a specific definition for \u201cassault weapon.\u201d The law, for example, did nothing to halt the sale of a certain brand of Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle. One such gun was purchased by Newtown resident Nancy Lanza, a firearms enthusiast who, as the world now knows, liked to take her troubled son to firing ranges. Bob Michel, a Republican and former House minority leader, remembers the weapon he carried when he hit the beach at Normandy with the 39th Infantry. It was a Browning automatic rifle, a machine gun with a 20-bullet magazine. Long retired from Congress, Michel is closely following the gun-control debate, which includes proposals to limit the size of ammunition magazines. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the magic number would be. But you shouldn\u2019t be able to carry more bullets than I did during World War II,\u201d Michel said. As a congressman from Illinois, Michel had always been pro-gun. But in 1994, preparing to retire from Congress, Michel decided that he could support a ban on assault weapons without doing violence to the Second Amendment. \u201cI was opposed to the ban mostly because of the influence that the National Rifle Association had. But you have to vote your conscience. I knew what damage these weapons can do,\u201d Michel recalled. \u201cThe NRA, they just monitored everything very, very closely. The whole argument was, if we thought we shouldn\u2019t have assault weapons, they thought the next thing we\u2019d do was we\u2019d take away everyone\u2019s pistols. When you\u2019re a junior congressman, there are pressure groups that you bow to. But as I got older and wiser, you say, \u2018My gosh, how long are we going to contend with this?\u2019 I wanted to get something done before I left.\u201d One target of NRA wrath was William J. Hughes, a veteran Democratic lawmaker from New Jersey who chaired the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on crime. He immersed himself in a series of gun-control bills, including efforts to ban armor-piercing bullets. Gun activists showed up at his town-hall meetings. They made posters superimposing Hughes\u2019s face on Adolf Hitler\u2019s body with an arm extended in a Nazi salute. Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist who later turned on the organization, says of Hughes: \u201cHe was very frustrating to us because he was from the most pro-gun area of New Jersey, very rural. That\u2019s big gun country. If you knew there was a district meeting, I would send out a mailing to every member within 50 miles and ask them to show up. \u2018Here are the issues you want to ask him about.\u2019 There would be a traffic jam in a suburban town.\u201d Hughes, now 80, said the NRA tried to have his membership revoked in a sportsman\u2019s club in Carneys Point Township, N.J. \u201cI was an honorary member. That became a cause celebre to get me kicked out, and some of the members tried to get me out,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cI came in with assault weapons to show them that they were part of the legislation, that it would not impact their ability to hunt. I showed them how lethal they were and no legitimate hunter would need that kind of a weapon.\u201d He kept his membership. But Dan Glickman didn\u2019t keep his job: The nine-term Democratic congressman serving Wichita, Kan., thought he was cruising to reelection in 1994. After he voted for the assault weapons ban, he learned otherwise. Glickman, a Wichita native, had recently passed a bill limiting the liability of small-aircraft manufacturers. That saved a lot of local jobs. One day, going door to door, Glickman shook hands with a man who congratulated him on the liability bill. \u201cBut I can't vote for you,\u201d the man said. Why not? asked Glickman. \u201cBecause of your vote on guns.\u201d Glickman said the law would merely ban assault weapons. Surely the man didn\u2019t need one of those. \u201cDan, don\u2019t tell me what I need or don\u2019t need,\u201d the man said. Glickman lost that November, as did scores of Democrats. The Republicans reclaimed the House for the first time in 40 years. Gun control was only one factor in the Democratic wipeout \u2014 many Democrats had backed a 1993 tax hike and an ambitious health-care-reform plan dubbed Hillarycare. But the 1994 election signaled a new era in which gun control would become a harder sell in Congress. The two parties became more ideologically distinct, with fewer moderates. After Al Gore failed to carry his home state of Tennessee in his 2000 presidential bid, political analysts said one factor was Gore\u2019s backing of gun control. Democrats in rural and blue- collar districts came to see gun control as a political loser. In 2004, Congress debated an extension of the 1994 ban, but gun control faced political headwinds that hadn\u2019t been there in the previous decade, and the ban expired. Sarah Brady didn\u2019t become a gun-control advocate immediately after her husband, Jim, President Ronald Reagan\u2019s press secretary, was shot in the head by John Hinckley during his attempt to assassinate the president in 1981. Her conversion happened four years later. She was jumping into a friend\u2019s pickup truck with her son, Scott, who was about 5 years old. The little boy found a pistol, a little one, a .22, sitting on the front seat. Sarah Brady snatched the gun from the boy\u2019s hand and confronted the driver. He said he kept it for self-defense. Later, watching TV, she heard that the NRA was trying to gut the 1968 Gun Control Act. She called the NRA: \u201cI\u2019m going to devote my life to fighting you people,\u201d she said. The first federal gun-control law, the National Firearms Act of 1934, levied a restrictive tax on machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. That was in response to gangsters using Tommy guns during gang wars in Chicago and other big cities. The 1968 act, passed after the assassinations of the 1960s, took broader aim at gun violence. The new laws prohibited felons, drug users and the mentally ill from buying guns; raised to 21 the age for legally purchasing a handgun from a licensed dealer; and expanded the licensing program for gun dealers. The NRA kept pushing back. In 1986, Congress passed the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which, among other things, restricted the number of times the ATF could inspect gun dealers. ****In that climate, Sarah Brady became an activist: \u201cYou can begin to see a sea change of attitudes during this time. The NRA was fighting against the cop-killing bullets and plastic guns, and we got into an alliance with law enforcement and we just got together and said, \u2018What\u2019s the first thing we should do?\u2019 And we all said, \u2018Background checks.\u2019 \u201d The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993, and a later version of the law, created a national system for checking the backgrounds of gun buyers: the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) maintained by the FBI. By the end of 2012, the system had performed more than 156 million background checks, with nearly a million gun purchases blocked by federal denials. But the law covered only licensed gun dealers. Private sales from one person to another are exempt from the background checks required by federal law. This is known as the \u201cgun show loophole.\u201d Experts think this accounts for about 40 percent of all gun sales. The gun lobby has tried to limit the powers of the ATF. The agency has fewer agents today than it did nearly 40 years ago and is able to inspect only a fraction of the nation\u2019s 60,000 retail gun dealers each year. The director of the ATF requires Senate confirmation, and the Justice Department has been unable to get an ATF director confirmed in six years. The agency currently only has an interim acting director. A consistent feature of federal gun-control laws is the prohibition of a federal database on gun ownership. This is a bright-line issue for the NRA, which has compared a federal database of gun ownership to actions by Nazi Germany. But LaPierre, in his remarks Friday, made clear that the NRA would support a different kind of national database: \u201cHow many more copycats are waiting in the wings for their moment of fame from a national media machine that rewards them with wall-to-wall attention and a sense of identity that they crave, while provoking others to try to make their mark? A dozen more killers, a hundred more? How can we possibly even guess how many, given our nation\u2019s refusal to create an active national database of the mentally ill?\u201d The broader picture includes a fact that seems paradoxical in light of Newtown: There is actually less gun violence today than there was 20 years ago. The national homicide rate is down to the level it was at in the early 1960s. But mass shootings have not declined in tandem with the homicide rate. No affluent, developed country has anything close to the U.S. level of gun violence. Of the 12,664 homicides in 2011, according to federal statistics, 8,583 were committed with a gun. No one knows precisely how many guns are owned in the United States, but estimates start at 270 million and rise from there. In 2010, the most recent year for comprehensive federal statistics on firearms commerce, U.S. companies manufactured more than 5 million guns and imported 3 million more. In January 2011, the annual SHOT Show \u2014 the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show and Conference, the premier event for the firearms industry \u2014 drew 55,000 people to the Venetian Las Vegas Hotel. The show featured 1,600 exhibitors, with one of the most popular displays being the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle. Just 11 days before the convention opened, Jared Loughner opened fire in Tucson, killing six people and wounding 13 more, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. \u201cWhat happened in Tucson was not a failure of gun-control laws,\u201d Lawrence Keane, the general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade group that happens to be based in Newtown, said at the time. \u201cThis was a failure of the mental-health system.\u201d In recent days, gun dealers have reported that Bushmaster semiautomatic rifles and similar guns have been flying off the shelves. \u201cSome people have mentioned that they have always thought about getting an AR, and now with talk of a ban, they are, just in case,\u201d said Donnel Dover, manager of Blue Ridge Arsenal in Chantilly. At Engage Armament in Rockville, which specializes in \u00adcombat-style rifles, co-owner Andrew Raymond said, \u201cWe\u2019ve sold out of almost every AR-15 we have.\u201d He said guns that sold for $1,200 last week will soon be selling for $1,800. The horrific shooting in Connecticut, he said, is likely \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. This is going to be the battle flag of the gun-control crowd.\u201d He asked: \u201cHow much freedom do we really give up for security? It\u2019s not just about guns, it\u2019s about everything single thing we do.\u201d The battles ahead will be fought by many people, not just lawmakers and lobbyists. Decisions will be influenced by public opinion, which showed a spike in favor of gun restrictions after Newtown. \u201cI have not seen the country so moved to action since September 11th,\u201d said Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine. What\u2019s different this time is that Newtown followed so many other recent mass shootings \u2014 including one just days earlier in Portland, Ore. \u201cThere\u2019s this sense of \u2018We have got to do something, and I want to know what my part is.\u2019 \u201d Michel, the former Republican minority leader, said: \u201cI wish there was some way of convincing the NRA that there are those of us who support the Second Amendment, but we still oppose assault weapons. If you\u2019re hunting and you take two shots and you miss, you don\u2019t deserve the prize.\u201d Sarah Brady talks of political realism: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be easier this time because we have social media to help us. But when it comes down to it, if all the pieces are not in place and you don\u2019t keep the pressure up, there\u2019s nothing the president can do. We need 218 in the House and 60 in the Senate.\u201d LaPierre on Friday made clear that the NRA will concede no ground on gun control: \u201cSince when did \u2018gun\u2019 automatically become a bad word? A gun in the hands of a Secret Service agent protecting our president isn\u2019t a bad word. A gun in the hands of a soldier protecting the United States of America isn\u2019t a bad word. And when you hear your glass breaking at 3 a.m. and you call 911, you won\u2019t be able to pray hard enough for a gun in the hands of a good guy to get there fast enough to protect you. \u201cSo why is the idea of a gun good when it\u2019s used to protect the president of our country or our police but bad when it\u2019s used to protect our children in our schools?\u201d On Dec. 14, Steve Sposato got a text from his sister in New York. Have you seen what happened in Newtown? Driving home that night, he pondered all the shootings in recent years. \u201cIn a place of worship, in a movie theater, in a business office, in Columbine, in a McDonald\u2019s, the one I lived through,\u201d Sposato said. \u201cWhat is it going to take? How many more wounded? How many more dead? How many more children? This is an absolute failure of government to protect its people, and we need to get serious about doing something.\u201d He told a reporter he would find that letter he had sent 19 years ago to Clinton demanding solutions to gun violence. As he rummaged through his files in his garage, he found himself reliving the nightmare of 1993. He kept looking and looking, and though he didn\u2019t find it this time, he knows it\u2019s got to be in there somewhere.", "Title: On gun control, banning semiautomatics isn\u2019t the answer Content: I was at the NRA gun range in Fairfax County the other day, shooting an AR-15 \u201cassault rifle.\u201d It\u2019s eerie to hold at first, as if the gun was not merely the same kind used in several recent mass killings but the same one. And when you hear the blast from that supersonic .223-caliber bullet, the thought that someone would use such a weapon on elementary school children makes you want to put it down. Ban it. Take it away. Beat it into a plowshare. For a moment, the proposal by gun control advocates to outlaw the rifle actually seemed to make sense. It was the relief that accompanies any quick fix to a vexing problem. Doing something is better than doing nothing, President Obama says. Except that blaming the gun really is doing nothing. The more I fired the AR-15, the harder it was to pretend that any gun was somehow more dangerous than the person holding it. Who would use a weapon to kill and why? Those ought to be the most pressing questions in the gun debate, not which weapon they use. There are too many to choose from. And no gun law magic act will make any of them disappear. I don\u2019t particularly like the AR-15, although it is one of the most popular rifles in the country. Three million have been sold, according to an NRA researcher. But to define it as an assault rifle because of how it looks \u2014 with a pistol grip, adjustable stock, flash suppressor and \u201chigh capacity\u201d magazine \u2014 is silly. You want to see a dangerous-looking gun, look at the one President Obama was photographed skeet shooting with at Camp David last summer. That shotgun of his was big enough to take down a woolly mammoth. When I pulled the trigger on the AR-15, one high-powered round came out. Maybe I hit something; maybe I didn\u2019t. Obama can\u2019t miss. He could clear a room with one double-barreled blast. Why ban one and not the other? And once you start banning semiautomatics, where do you stop? If gun control advocates were truly serious and not just well meaning, they\u2019d be focusing a lot more on education and mental health. For instance, everybody knows that our children are being adversely affected by violent video games. So why aren\u2019t schools deconstructing video games as part of the curriculum, explaining to students how the military uses these same war games to condition troops to kill without remorse? Show students, frame by frame, how they are being gamed by the gamers and how profits are made by making them mentally ill. This is not to give my fellow gun owners a free ride. If gun control advocates lack imagination, some of the solutions to gun violence offered by the gun lobby strike me as unrealistic. Arming teachers? George Lyon, with whom I enjoy target shooting and who owns that AR-15, thinks that\u2019s the way to go, along with much of the country, according to recent polls. Lyon, a D.C. resident and lawyer, was part of a legal fight against gun control that resulted in the Supreme Court loosening gun laws in the city. Now he wants the D.C. Council to consider a proposal for protecting the city\u2019s public schools: \u201cOn a voluntary basis, school staff would undergo training designed and supervised by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and be sworn in as DC Reserve Police Officers,\u201d the plan reads. The job of these \u201cSchool Shield Officers,\u201d as they are called, would be to \u201cserve as the last line of defense against a lethal threat to innocent students, pending the arrival of responding officers.\u201d To get some idea about the shooting skills that a shield officer would need, Lyon set up a \u201chostage rescue\u201d exercise for me to try: I would use several kinds of guns \u2014 including the AR-15 \u2014 to shoot a paper target where the bad guy\u2019s head was partially visible behind a \u201chostage.\u201d At just 20 feet away, muscles in the hand tighten. Just the idea of having to make a sure shot \u2014 on a stationary piece of paper, no less \u2014 causes the nerves to twitch. No amount of training could prepare a \u201cvolunteer\u201d to make that shot in real life. Keep your guns, folks; but keep them out of the schools. Let that be the place where students learn not to need one.", "Title: Marco Rubio\u2019s claim that no recent mass shootings would have been prevented by gun laws Content: _\u201cNone of the major shootings that have occurred in this country over the last few months or years that have outraged us, would gun laws have prevented them.\u201d_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **\u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), interview on CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning,\u201d Dec. 4, 2015** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A colleague pointed out this statement by Marco Rubio as a possible fact check, suggesting that it was almost certainly incorrect. It posed an interesting challenge, given the reams of data to examine. The Fact Checker obviously takes no position on proposed gun-control laws. But given the attention of recent mass public shootings, is Rubio correct that none of the major shootings in recent years would have been prevented by new gun laws? Rubio was not specific in his time frame \u2014 and a spokesman declined to elaborate \u2014 but for the purposes of this fact check we will go back as far as the Newtown shooting in 2012, which touched off the current gun debate. First of all, we should note that there is an unbridgeable gap in opinion about efficacy of various gun proposals, particularly regarding assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \u201cThe common thread that binds most mass shootings is semiautomatic firearms with the ability to accept a high-capacity detachable ammunition magazine,\u201d said Avery Palmer, communications director at the Violence Policy Center, which supports restrictions on guns. \u201cThese can range from assault rifles, pistols, and shotguns, to compact, high-capacity pistols marketed for concealed carry. Today\u2019s gun industry has embraced increased lethality as its marketing lodestar, and one key element in reducing the occurrence and severity of mass shootings lies in ratcheting down the firepower in civilian hands.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico By contrast, gun-rights supporters argue that bans on certain weapons and large-capacity magazines would accomplish little. There are already more than 5 million AR-type rifles in circulation in the United States, ownership of which would have been grandfathered under proposed bans. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A previous nationwide assault-weapons ban, which lasted 10 years and lapsed in 2004, was easily circumvented by gun manufacturers, in part because of various loopholes. The evidence is mixed on how effective that ban was, with both sides often cherry-picking from the most comprehensive report on that law, written in 2004 by Christopher Koper of George Mason University. \u201cThe ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect, but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimizations had it remained in place for a longer period,\u201d Koper wrote in 2013. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico John R. Lott Jr., at the pro-gun Crime Prevention Research Center, notes that such bans would target .223-caliber weapons but would not affect more powerful semiautomatic rifles using .30-06 caliber, which are used for hunting deer. (This video demonstrates the difference.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Meanwhile, an experienced shooter, as shown in this video, can change a magazine in just two to four seconds. That calls into question whether such a ban would significantly reduce the death toll. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A new study by Gary Kleck of Florida State University studied news accounts of 23 shootings between 1994 and 2013 in which more than six people were killed or wounded and large-capacity magazines were used. In only one case was a shooter stopped as he tried to reload. In all of these 23 incidents, the shooter possessed either multiple guns or multiple magazines, indicating that a determined shooter would not have been deterred by smaller magazines. Now let\u2019s look at the facts behind Rubio\u2019s statement. Is there evidence that gun law proposals would have prevented the recent high-profile mass shootings? We developed the following list of 12 mass shootings since 2012 catalogued in the Mother Jones database of U.S. mass shootings, with details obtained from various news and official reports. We will look at whether proposals might have made a difference in how the guns were obtained, or whether existing laws worked as intended. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Mass Shootings since 2012** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Dec. 2, 2015:** Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif., using a Smith & Wesson M&P; AR-15 type rifle, a DPMS Panther Arms AR-15 type rifle, a Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol and a Llama semiautomatic pistol. The guns were purchased legally and the rifles were purchased legally by a former neighbor. (The transfer of the rifles to the suspects may have violated California and federal laws.) Four high- capacity magazines were found, perhaps holding as many as 30 rounds. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Oct. 1, 2015:** Christopher Harper-Mercer killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. He owned 14 firearms and conducted the attack with six of them, including a Glock pistol, a Smith & Wesson pistol, a Taurus pistol and a Del-Ton AR-15 rifle. All were purchased legally. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **July 16, 2015:** Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez killed five people and wounded two at the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. He used an AK-47-style rifle and 9mm handgun, and a shotgun was in his car. He had multiple 30-round magazines, news reports said. Officials said the gun was obtained legally; other weapons were obtained through Armslist.com, an online forum through which individuals can buy and sell firearms through private transactions. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **June 17, 2015:** Dylann Roof killed nine people with a .45-caliber Glock pistol that held 13 rounds at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. Roof legally purchased his gun from a store, but the FBI said he should have failed the background check because he had been charged with possessing Suboxone without a prescription. However, because of clerical mistakes, the FBI said the examiner did not get hold of the report before the three-day waiting period ended, and so the store went through with the purchase. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Oct. 24, 2014:** Jaylen Ray Fryberg, a teenager, killed four students with a high-capacity Beretta pistol at the Marysville-Pilchuck High School cafeteria in Marysville, Wash. The pistol belonged to his father, who was the subject of a permanent protection order. That should have prevented the purchase of the gun, but the order had not been entered in the system and so his father passed the background check. The father was later found guilty of knowingly purchasing six firearms he could not legally possess. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Feb. 20, 2014:** Cherie Lash Rhoades killed four people and wounded two at the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Office and Community Center in Alturas, Calif. She used a 9mm semiautomatic handgun and stabbed a person with a butcher knife when a second gun apparently jammed. It isn\u2019t clear how the gun was obtained; her trial has not taken place. (Note: Rhoades killed her brother, niece, nephew and another tribal member, so some might say this is a family dispute, not a mass public shooting.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Sept. 16, 2013:** Aaron Alexis, who had been treated for mental health issues but never committed, killed 12 people with a Remington shotgun at the Washington Navy Yard. He had tried to buy a handgun at a Virginia store but changed his mind after he was told it would have to be delivered to his home state through another federally licensed dealer. But he was able to purchase a shotgun. He passed state and federal background checks; he had been arrested three times but not convicted. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **July 26, 2013:** Pedro Vargas set fire to his apartment in Hialeah, Fla., and killed six people with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Vargas bought his handgun legally and had a concealed weapons permit. (Note: Most of the deaths took place in an apartment complex, not a public space, so some say this should not be considered a public shooting.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **June 7, 2013:** John Zawahri killed five people in Santa Monica, Calif., using a .223 semiautomatic rifle, similar in type to an AR-15. He also had multiple 30-round magazines \u2014 which are illegal in California \u2014 and during the rampage had dropped a bag which contained additional loaded magazines, a handgun and the upper receiver for a semiautomatic rifle. He also appeared to have made some weapons that are illegal. Investigators later found a 2011 letter from the Department of Justice informing Zawahri that he was not eligible to purchase a firearm. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **April 21, 2013:** Dennis Clark III shot and killed his girlfriend in their apartment in Federal Way, Wash., and then killed three other people using a .40-caliber Taurus semiautomatic pistol and a pistol-grip Mossberg 500 pump shotgun with a four-round saddle. The weapons were obtained legally, and he had a concealed pistol license. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **March 13, 2013:** Kurt Myers killed four people and wounded two with a shotgun in neighboring towns in Herkimer County, N.Y. The shotgun apparently was obtained legally. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Dec. 14, 2012:** Adam Lanza killed his mother in their home with a Savage Mark II .22-caliber rifle and then killed 26 people, mostly children, with a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle (with a 30-round magazine) at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. His weapons, which also included handguns and a 12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun, were found in Lanza\u2019s car outside the school and had been legally obtained by his mother, a gun enthusiast. Lanza, in effect, stole his mother\u2019s firearms. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico This is certainly a depressing chronicle of death and tragedy. But Rubio\u2019s statement stands up to scrutiny \u2014 at least for the recent past, as he framed it. Notably, three of the mass shootings took place in California, which already has strong gun laws including a ban on certain weapons and high-capacity magazines. Gun-control advocates often point to the experience in other countries that have enacted gun laws that heavily restrict gun ownership; as we have shown, quantitative measures of cross-comparative crime statistics, especially where the crime is not consistently defined (i.e., \u201cmass shooting\u201d), usually end up being apples-to-oranges comparisons. It is possible that some gun-control proposals, such as a ban on large-capacity magazines, would reduce the number of dead in a future shooting, though the evidence for that is heavily disputed. But Rubio was speaking in the past, about specific incidents. He earns a rare Geppetto Checkmark. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico (About our rating scale) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Send us facts to check by filling outthis form** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **Follow The Fact Checker onTwitter and friend us on Facebook** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 4, "direct_reason": "This passage directly addresses the query by arguing that banning specific guns like the AR-15 won't solve the problem of mass shootings.

An April 30 deal to fund the government through September excluded funds for Trump\u2019s wall. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) anticipated in an interview to CNN that a funding plan without the wall will be challenged: \u201cYou are going to see a lot of conservatives against this plan this week.\u201d It is unclear who is going to pay for it After 100 days and a diplomatic clash with Mexico, the new administration has not been able to secure funding for the wall, but some details have been released on priority areas for building. A preliminary document from Homeland Security anticipates constructing more than 100 miles of various border barriers over the next two years. Since January, deportation rules have been modified. Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he directed federal prosecutors to make immigration cases a higher priority, and the Department of Homeland Security found 33,000 more detention beds to house undocumented immigrants and opened discussions with dozens of local police forces. The number of immigrants apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol while trying to cross illegally dropped in the first few months of 2017 compared with the same period last year: Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly told the Senate in March that the decline was a result of the administration\u2019s \u201cimplementation of executive orders to enforce immigration laws.\u201d Although President Trump\u2019s Jan. 27 order mandated that the wall be a contiguous and impassable physical barrier, Kelly clarified to the Senate on April 5, \u201cIt is unlikely a wall will be built from sea to shining sea.\u201d Border security experts prefer a see-through barrier Whether the border barrier will be a solid concrete wall is still unclear. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fence, it\u2019s a wall,\u201d Trump said in a January news conference. But DHS has been receiving bids for two different kind of barriers: a \u201csolid concrete wall\u201d and a \u201csee-through component/capability\u201d option. Detailed proposals have not been released, but the preliminary plan shows the first 14 miles of wall could be raised near Imperial Beach and Chula Vista in the San Diego area. Michael Fisher, a former chief of the Border Patrol with three decades of experience patrolling the border, said a barrier designed to allow officers to see through is preferable. \u201cWhen we first got that fence we quickly noted that it was very difficult for us unless we would have the technology to see over it,\u201d he told The Post, recalling his time in the San Diego sector, where the first fence of corrugated steel went up in the \u201990s. \u201cMaybe there were groups of people on the other side and we couldn\u2019t see them. There are sections that the Border Patrol cut out to see through.\u201d Ronald Colburn, president of the Border Patrol Foundation, said, \u201cI doubt they even discussed a solid concrete wall. I think that is an urban legend. \u2026 There is no single item of technology, manpower, infrastructure or single concept that solves a border security issue for any country. It is a combination of the right resources that make it.\u201d There are segments of the border where a wall is not needed and other technology is preferred, he said. According to National Border Patrol Council spokesman Shawn Moran, \u201cThe wall will be different in each sector and station depending on the needs.\u201d Most of the current pedestrian and vehicle fencing starts to the west, in San Diego. It runs along the southern edges of California, Arizona and New Mexico. Gaps were left open in some sectors of rough terrain. Today, fenced and unfenced areas are monitored with drones, radar cameras and personnel. And experts say a barrier is not necessary along the whole border According to border security experts, fences or walls are useful as a way to direct illegal crossers to areas where Border Patrol has a strategic advantage. Single or double fencing allow agents to react to certain events, especially in highly populated areas. In remote areas, natural barriers already do this. \u201cYou can go out to the beaches in San Diego, where I worked before, all through the sand dunes in Yuma, through the mountains in eastern Arizona, to the flat areas in El Paso ... all the way to the river areas in south Texas which I patrolled as well. There is not one suite of technology or infrastructure that works well everywhere,\u201d Fisher said. East of El Paso, 1,255 miles of border are defined by the winding path of the Rio Grande. It has a long history of meandering and changing course over the years. For Colburn, \u201cThe good Lord created a wall there, a canyon wall.\u201d A fence can\u2019t be placed within its floodplain and its design can\u2019t obstruct the flow of water. Sally Spener, the U.S. secretary of the International Boundary and Water Commission, explained that blocking the flow of the river \u201ccould cause the flow to be deflected and cause the international boundary to shift.\u201d The impact on local landowners and wildlife could be extensive The few segments of barrier already built along the lower Rio Grande Valley under the 2006 Fence Act were built out of the flood plain, cutting out large areas of U.S. agricultural land and farms. West of El Paso, most of the land is federally owned. To the east, most of what remains unfenced is privately owned. According to the Texas Observer, local landowners are already receiving first notices of land condemnation for Trump\u2019s border wall. The Rio Grande also runs along rich natural areas like the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, where a barrier could cut access to endangered species like the ocelot. Local politicians, including some strong supporters of border enforcement like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), have expressed their opposition to a wall running along national parks such as Big Bend. Gus Sanchez, superintendent of Chamizal National Memorial, who has years of experience working for the U.S. National Parks Service in the area, explained the overlap of social and natural boundaries between the U.S. and Mexico and said the existing fence cut the access to the river to local communities and wildlife. \u201cI tried once to explain to javelinas that this was an international boundary but they didn\u2019t listen to me,\u201d joked Sanchez, who has Native American and Mexican ancestors. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t speak English or Spanish so they just ignored me.\u201d", "Title: Endangered animals are already cut off by a border wall. Trump wants it to be much bigger. Content: The \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d that President Trump vowed again this week to build along the Mexican border won\u2019t block just humans. Dozens of animal species that migrate freely across the international line in search of water, food and mates would be walled off. A list of animals that dwell near the 1,300-mile expanse that the proposed wall would cover seems endless. In May, in a report called Trump Wall, Outside magazine, using information compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pointed out more than 100 species between California and Texas that are listed as threatened and endangered under the Endangered Species Act, or are candidates for a spot on the list. But outside the government, scientists who\u2019ve studied how 670 miles of walls and fences erected as part of the Secure Fence Act under former president George W. Bush in 2006 tell stories of animals stopping in their tracks, staring at barriers they couldn\u2019t cross. \u201cAt the border wall, people have found large mammals confounded and not knowing what to do,\u201d said Jesse Lasky, an assistant professor of biology at Penn State University. Deer, mountain lions, jaguar and ocelots are among the animals whose daily movement was disrupted, he said. Trump\u2019s proposed wall, estimated to cost between $15 billion and $25 billion, would cover parts of the border that the Bush project, which was essentially abandoned because of its cost in 2009, does not. Research on the impact of the current barrier fence is limited because the 2006 act gave the Homeland Security secretary sweeping power to build quickly, without the need for environmental impact studies or other analysis that would show how the land would be disturbed and how flora and fauna could potentially be harmed. While at the University of Texas, Lasky led a study on the impact of barriers published in the journal Diversity and Distributions in 2011. The study\u2019s main conclusion was that the \u201cnew barriers would increase the number of species at risk.\u201d A big concern, Lasky said in an interview Friday, was that over time the populations of threatened and endangered species would decline. A wall cutting off isolated populations from those on the other side of the wall would exacerbate the problem because they couldn\u2019t mate, at least not in a sustainable way. \u201cThere are concerns about small populations mating with each other and inbreeding, and getting genetic disorders from inbreeding,\u201d Lasky said. Their problems wouldn\u2019t end there. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about it much in the paper, but with climate change, if an animal or any organism is going to stay in the temperatures it prefers, it has to move to track those conditions. That\u2019s going to be important for the persistence of a lot of species.\u201d A 2008 study mentioned the decline of carnivores, such as the grizzly bear and gray wolf, at the U.S.-Mexico border and renewed interest in protecting Neotropical cat species there. \u201cIn the U.S.A., there are no known breeding populations of jaguars and only two\u2026populations of ocelots,\u201d according to the study by scientists at Pace University in New York and the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Quer\u00e9taro in Mexico. The cats \u201care threatened by land development and land conversion, predator control by cattle growers, an increase in disease exposure, construction of highways, international bridges and immigration-control infrastructure,\u201d meaning border walls. More walls would greatly magnify the threat, the researchers said.", "Title: Trump proposes sharp cuts at Interior Department while pushing for more drilling on public lands Content: The White House wants to cut the Interior Department budget by about 12 percent as the Trump administration shifts the agency\u2019s focus toward promoting fossil fuel drilling and extraction on public lands and in federal waters. The budget proposal released Tuesday would reduce Interior\u2019s funding to $11.6 billion in fiscal 2018 \u2014 about $1.6 billion less annually \u2014 and eliminate programs that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has called unnecessary, duplicative or a low priority. Among them: discretionary grants to help reclaim abandoned mine sites, National Heritage areas that Trump administration officials say are more appropriately funded locally and National Wildlife Refuge payments to local governments. The budget also significantly decreases funding for new major acquisitions of federal land, cutting such appropriations by more than $120 million. The administration says it instead intends to focus on investing in and maintaining existing federal lands. In particular, Tuesday\u2019s proposal would boost money to help address the roughly $11 billion maintenance backlog within the national park system. \u201cIt was not an easy job. There were difficult decisions that were made,\u201d Zinke said in a call with reporters. \u201cThis budget overall speaks to the core mission of the Department of the Interior. It funds our highest priorities \u2014 safety, security, infrastructure.\u201d The budget proposal would pour more funding into the development of oil, gas and coal investments on public lands. Onshore fossil fuel programs would receive $189 million annually, an increase of $24 million; offshore programs would get $343 million, including a $10 million increase to update the nation\u2019s five-year offshore drilling plan. The Bureau of Land Management would get a $16 million increase in its oil and gas management program to accelerate the rate at which its staff processes permit applications and addresses right-of-way requests for infrastructure projects. The budget also includes a proposal aimed at opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas leasing, though that would require approval by Congress. \u201cWe have not been a good partner with industry,\u201d Zinke said of the push for expanded energy production on public lands, adding that federal revenue from offshore drilling leases is only a fraction of what it was a decade ago. \u201cEnergy production is vital to our national security and our national economy.\u201d Last month, President Trump signed an executive order aimed at expanding offshore drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and assessing whether energy exploration can take place in marine sanctuaries in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Zinke has said it would probably take about two years to do a thorough review of what new areas could be put up for auction. The Interior Department employs 70,000 people at more than 2,000 locations and manages 530 million acres, or about 20 percent of U.S. territory. It controls even more resources underground, including about 700 million acres of minerals. Environmentalists were quick to criticize the proposed cuts, saying the budget would prioritize fossil fuel development while hurting key science programs, hindering work to protect threatened and endangered species and crippling the National Wildlife Refuge System \u2014 the world\u2019s largest land-and-water system dedicated to wildlife conservation. \u201cThe Trump budget includes devastating and unacceptable cuts to vital conservation programs,\u201d said Jamie Rappaport Clark, chief executive of the advocacy group Defenders of Wildlife, who directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under Bill Clinton. \u201cWe owe it to our children and grandchildren to be good stewards of our environment and leave behind a legacy of protecting our air, land, water and wildlife. But this budget is a disaster that flies in the face of those values.\u201d Interior officials are also taking aim at the wild horses and burros that range on federal lands, by seeking to eliminate language that restricts it from euthanizing the animals in order to reduce their numbers. The Bureau of Land Management estimates that as of March nearly 73,000 wild horses and burros roam federal land, \u201calmost three times the number that is sustainable and healthy for the land and the animals.\u201d BLM wants to use \u201cthe full range of tools\u201d identified under a 1971 law, the agency said in a statement, \u201cincluding humane euthanasia and unrestricted sale of certain excess animals.\u201d", "Title: On the Mexico border, a surge of migrants ahead of a possible \u2018Trump Wall\u2019 Content: MCALLEN, Tex. \u2014 To save time, Adriana Zavala would take a shortcut down an empty lane on the way to school, until the afternoon last September when the tattooed Salvadoran gangsters blocked her way. The threats she began receiving that day \u2014 sell our drugs to your classmates or we\u2019ll rape you \u2014 propelled the teenager, her father and 13-year-old sister to begin a five-month odyssey from El Salvador that has ended, for now, in this Texas town. They are among thousands of migrants arriving at the U.S. border in what authorities fear could be another surge of Central American families. \u201cIn my country, they\u2019re going to kill me. And I can\u2019t die right now. There are so many things I want to do,\u201d said Zavala, a 17-year-old who wants to be a chef and take singing classes. On the U.S. campaign trail, illegal immigration is a hot-button topic, with the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, vowing to build a 1,000-mile border wall. But along this stretch of Texas border, where migrants climb over and walk around existing fencing, such proposed solutions tend to draw scorn, even from Trump fans. And the politician\u2019s tough talk, people here say, might actually be attracting more migrants. Although the overall number of migrants apprehended along the border this year has not yet reached the proportions of the 2014 flood of Central Americans, some believe that could happen, with a summer surge before the presidential election in November. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely on track to catch up to it, which is not a good thing,\u201d said Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol agent and union representative here. \u201cThe political climate has a lot to do with it.\u201d The upcoming presidential election marks a fork in the road for U.S. immigration policy: A Democratic victory could lead to more unauthorized immigrants getting permits to work and live in the United States. Trump has vowed to build the giant border wall, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and block remittances. Intense violence and a lack of job opportunities are the driving forces behind the Central American migration, and critics say those problems will continue to push people northward regardless of whether there is a bigger wall. For some of the migrants, sooner seems more appealing than later. Trump \u201csays he wants to build a wall. They want to get over before he builds it,\u201d said Mario Saucedo Mendoza, who works at the Senda de Vida migrant shelter in Reynosa, the Mexican city across the border from McAllen. \u201cHe\u2019s said these things, and people are trying to get in front of him, they are trying to cross now.\u201d Mexicans have historically made up the largest nationality apprehended by the Border Patrol: There were 187,284 detained last year. The immigration from three Central American countries known as the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d \u2014 El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala \u2014 reached its high-water mark in 2014, when 227,371 people were apprehended by U.S. authorities. That number dropped sharply to 160,496 last year, but the decline is somewhat misleading, because Mexican authorities, under U.S. pressure, began detaining far more Central Americans en route to the United States. Taken together, U.S. and Mexican authorities detained 332,430 Central Americans last year, nearly as many as the 347,085 people captured in 2014, according to government statistics. This spring, the numbers appear to be rising again. The figures on Central Americans detained in Mexico are above 2014 levels. The Sacred Heart Catholic Church shelter in McAllen, which opened in June 2014 amid the surge and has since taken in more than 35,000 people, has seen days this month with more than 200 migrant arrivals, something that has never previously happened. Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, said that the Border Patrol sends migrants when it has run out of space in centers where the detainees are held before proceeding to immigration court. \u201cThis is overflow,\u201d she said, as Central American children played with donated toys and their parents chose from piles of secondhand clothes, arranged by gender and size. \u201cThis year, specifically this month and this couple of weeks, our numbers have increased a lot. \u201cThe families are arriving because it\u2019s impossible to live in their home countries,\u201d she added. \u201cThey know their child runs a high risk of being killed, of being kidnapped, of being taken away, and they\u2019ve seen this happen to other people, so they figure out: We have to go.\u201d Yenis Constancia Viuda de Cruz, a 26-year-old mother of three whose husband was slain by Salvadoran gang members in 2010, decided to flee out of fear that gangs were trying to recruit her eldest son, 9-year-old Pablo Jos\u00e9. With a plan to reunite with her mother, who lives in Silver Spring, Md., Viuda de Cruz paid $2,800 in fees to smugglers and bribes to Mexican officials to reach the United States, she said. Like other migrants apprehended by the Border Patrol, she was made to wear a black ankle bracelet with a blinking light, so authorities could track her movements before an immigration court date in Maryland, during which she would plead for asylum. \u201cMy children were in danger,\u201d she said before leaving on a bus for Maryland. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to another country?\u2019 There isn\u2019t another country where you can provide something better for your children, where you won\u2019t get harmed. The only one is the United States.\u201d One factor causing the 2014 Central American migrant surge was a rumor that President Obama was offering amnesty to women and children. The U.S. government has tried to dispel that notion, paying for a barrage of television and radio advertisements in Central America trying to discourage people from migrating. U.S. authorities worked to break up migrant smuggler rings and pressured Mexican and Central American governments to impede the flow of migrants. On the U.S. side of the border, there are plenty of Trump fans, but even some supporters are skeptical about his idea of walling off Mexico. Border fences and barriers, including sections of roughly 20-foot-tall steel rods, already exist piecemeal along about a third of the 2,000-mile border. Migrants have used ladders and ropes to climb over them, jackhammers to tunnel underneath, blowtorches to cut through them \u2014 or have simply trekked around them. The barriers, which don\u2019t always track exactly with the U.S. border, also have divided people\u2019s ranches, Native American reservations and universities, while disrupting the flow of wildlife and commerce. Ruben Villarreal, a Republican candidate for Congress, former mayor of Rio Grande City and Trump supporter, called the wall idea a \u201c12th-century technical solution to a 21st-century problem.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a fence that\u2019s impenetrable,\u201d he said. And all the talk of it is \u201ccausing a draw\u201d of people. The migrant attitude is \u201churry, hurry, hurry, get there,\u201d he said. The campaign trail talk \u201cis going to encourage people from here to November.\u201d", "Title: A road we don\u2019t need in Alaska Content: _T_ he true price of Sally Jewell\u2019s confirmation as the new interior secretary is about to be revealed. Before agreeing not to fight Jewell\u2019s nomination last month, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) extracted a commitment from the Interior Department to delay a decision on whether a road can be built to the southwest Alaska village of King Cove, population 950. A few weeks ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the road would severely damage the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, a national treasure that is home to a vast array of creatures, including seals, salmon, caribou, bears and waterfowl. The senator was buying time in an effort to persuade the new secretary to go against the service\u2019s findings and approve the road anyway. Now the final decision is pending \u2014 and more than wildlife is at stake. It is really the U.S. taxpayer who stands to lose if the road goes through. The additional cost to federal taxpayers for building the road would be more than $33 million \u2014 a lot of money for one tiny village. And if it seems like you have heard this story before, that\u2019s because you have. In 1998, we were the interior secretary and director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, respectively, when the Izembek road proposal was earmarked in an appropriations bill headed for passage in Congress. But a lengthy scientific review determined that the road would devastate the Izembek refuge, so President Bill Clinton threatened a veto unless the earmark was removed. Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), then chairman of the Appropriations Committee, rolled out his main argument: The residents of King Cove needed better access to an air strip in the event of medical emergencies requiring evacuation. In response, we suggested upgrading the existing ferry service from King Cove across Cold Bay to the air strip, which would avoid the need for a road through a wildlife refuge. Stevens responded that an upgraded ferry would work, if we were prepared to also fund an upgrade of the existing marine terminals on the bay. We agreed. The senator then demanded an upgraded video teleconference link to a trauma facility in Anchorage. We agreed. Then he asked for a new ocean-worthy hovercraft capable of crossing the bay in any weather. We agreed to that as well. The final bill to the U.S. taxpayer? Over $50 million; more than $52,000 per resident of King Cove. It was a huge price to pay to accommodate the rare medical emergencies of one small Alaska village, but accommodate them we did. Alaska got its taxpayer-funded medical emergency solution, and we helped ensure the survival of the Izembek Refuge. End of story. Or so we thought. Now the Alaska delegation is back, once again demanding a road through the refuge, as if the 1998 deal had never happened. That hovercraft purchased with taxpayer dollars? Despite a 100 percent success rate in carrying out more than 30 medical evacuations, local officials suspended service in 2010, saying the hovercraft was unreliable and too expensive to operate. But that hasn\u2019t stopped them from using it to transport seasonal seafood workers from a nearby cannery. Moreover, as Pete Mjos, the former medical director for the area, recently said, the proposed road would be impassable and even life-threatening during the region\u2019s typical winter storms. Even in the best weather conditions, it would still be a two-hour trip. The hovercraft? Thirty minutes each way across the bay. And all without slicing through a pristine wilderness area with 21 miles of road, eight bridges, 19 culverts and 254 stream crossings. Congress is on record calling for an end to earmarks for pork-barrel projects. And every day we hear more calls for spending cuts and belt-tightening. U.S. taxpayers have already chipped in more than enough for this project. Asking them to pay tens of millions on top of the more than $50 million they have already spent is asking too much. It\u2019s time the Izembek road project was killed for good. **Read more from Opinions:** The Post\u2019s View: Keystone XL is coming back The Post\u2019s View: The wrong call on on the pipeline project Dana Milbank: The Confederacy of Takers"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 2, "direct_reason": "This passage directly discusses the impact of Trump's proposed border wall on wildlife and their habitats.

Yes. Content: Dan Kahan pointed me to a recent post by Robert Lupton and Christopher Hare, who report, based on recent survey data, that \u201cconservatives are more likely to believe that vaccines cause autism.\u201d Lupton and Hare write: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico More specifically: So far, so good. They have the information needed to see whether conservatives are more likely to believe that vaccines cause autism (assuming, as usual, that the survey responses accurately represent people\u2019s views and that the sample is representative of the population). Here\u2019s what Lupton and Hare report: And here\u2019s my problem (and Kahan\u2019s). The above graph, and the associated regression analysis, _does not directly answer the question by the title of this post_. To directly answer that question, you want to make a direct comparison: a simple plot (or even a tabulation) of the percentage of respondents who believe in the vaccines-autism link, as a function of political ideology. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico [See P.P.S. below for a graph that shows the direct comparison, sent to me by the authors in response to this post.] Once you\u2019ve shown the basic comparisons, it makes a lot of sense to do more elaborate analyses. I have every reason to believe that, if you look directly at the data collected by Lupton and Hare, that you\u2019ll find the pattern they claim, that conservatives are more likely to believe that vaccines cause autism. I just want to see it. More generally, when we claim X, we should show X. This comes up a lot in statistical analysis, that there\u2019s a tendency to do one thing and describe it as another. None of the above should be taken as a criticism of Lupton and Hare\u2019s research. Rather, it\u2019s an opportunity for them to show the direct comparisons and use these as a baseline to better understand their more elaborate analysis. It\u2019s not just about showing something simple for the general public; it\u2019s also about understanding regression models by linking them to the numbers. **P.S.** Just to clarify: The above post is _not_ a criticism of Lupton and Hare\u2019s research, nor does it represent a disbelief in their claim. Given the analyses they\u2019ve shown, I have every reason to believe their claim that conservatives are more likely to believe that vaccines cause autism. And it\u2019s an important thing to know. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to see the direct comparison, to confirm that their claim is correct. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **P.P.S.** Hare and Lupton sent the following graph showing the direct relationship between political ideology and belief in the autism/vaccines link: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So, yes, a direct look at the data reveals a real difference. According to this graph, the percentage of autism/vaccine believers is twice as high among extreme conservatives, as among liberals and moderates. Hare emphasizes: \u201cthe lowess smoother is NOT based on the jittered values, I simply jitter the points to illustrate density.\u201d And Lupton points to \u201cprevious research suggests that low trust in government is related to requests for non-medical exemptions to vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d for example this paper: Salmon, Daniel A., Lawrence H.

It\u2019s good to see the raw data as well as the more elaborate statistical analysis.", "Title: Vaccine debate presents a political minefield \u2014 as Hillary Clinton can attest Content: The latest tweet from Hillary Rodham Clinton sounded straightforward enough: \u201cThe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork.\u201d But the issue of vaccinations has long been politically and emotionally fraught \u2014 involving not just public health but also the proper role of government, the prerogatives of parents and medical riddles that have yet to be solved. Probably no one in public life today has felt those crosscurrents more strongly than the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination. On the issue of vaccination over the past two decades, Clinton has repeatedly found herself on the front lines of advocacy and criticism. Other politicians \u2014 including two potential GOP presidential hopefuls, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) \u2014 have been learning those political lessons the hard way in recent days. Both made statements questioning whether childhood vaccinations should be mandatory, bringing a torrent of criticism, including from medical professionals who are alarmed over a recent rise in measles cases. As a new first lady in 1993, Clinton championed what became the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, designed to provide free inoculations against nine diseases to children who otherwise might not get them. It now covers 14 diseases. Clinton\u2019s role in that endeavor landed her in the crossfire. Conservatives blamed her when shortfalls of some vaccines developed in subsequent years, arguing that the private market was better at allocating resources. \u201cOne of her pet projects is a bust,\u201d the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote in a 2003 piece headlined \u201cHillary\u2019s Vaccine Shortage.\u201d Meanwhile, Clinton also found herself the target of a burgeoning movement that linked the rising rate of autism to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that has since been removed from childhood vaccines. Some advocates of this theory went so far as to dub her \u201cThimerosal Hillary.\u201d For reasons that scientists cannot explain, the incidence of autism is up markedly. Last year, the CDC estimated that 1 in 68 children age 8 had been identified with the range of conditions known as autism spectrum disorder. That was about 30 percent higher than previous estimates, reported in 2012, of 1 in 88 children. Clinton, as a presidential candidate in 2008, wrote in response to a candidate questionnaire: \u201cI am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism, including possible environmental causes like vaccines. . . . We don\u2019t know what, if any, kind of link there is between vaccines and autism \u2014 but we should find out.\u201d Her then-rival, Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), also called for more research into whether there was some correlation. And 2008 GOP presidential contender John McCain (R-Ariz.) went so far as to say there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d of a connection between vaccines and autism. But even in 2008, the weight of medical evidence was against such a link and the candidates who indulged such speculation were accused of pandering. In 2010, the argument against vaccination received a devastating blow from the Lancet, a medical journal that 12 years before had published a study alleging that inoculations for measles, mumps and rubella were a cause of autism. The journal retracted the study, saying the supposed research had been falsified. Another iteration of the vaccination issue flared in the 2012 Republican primary campaign, when then-Gov. Rick \u00adPerry of Texas found himself under fire for a mandate requiring most girls in his state to get inoculated against the human papillomavirus, a sexual infection that can lead to cervical cancer. Some social conservatives argued that it would encourage girls to have sex. Republican leaders have not welcomed the rekindling of the vaccine debate sparked by Christie\u2019s comment Monday that parents should have \u201csome measure of choice\u201d in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. Paul \u2014 a physician with a libertarian philosophy \u2014 joined the argument with an unfounded claim that there are \u201cmany tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\u201d Paul took to Twitter on Tuesday to defend himself, saying he supports vaccinations and posing for photographs as he received a booster shot. \u201cI did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related \u2014 I did not allege causation,\u201d he wrote in one tweet. House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) sought to tamp the furor down by saying Tuesday, \u201cI don\u2019t know that we need another law, but I do believe that all children ought to be vaccinated.\u201d Meanwhile, several other potential 2016 contenders distanced themselves from Christie and Paul. \u201cAbsolutely, all children in America should be vaccinated,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Tuesday. \u201cUnless their immune [system is] suppressed, obviously, for medical exceptions, but I believe that all children, as is the law in most states in this country, before they can even attend school, have to be vaccinated for a certain panel.\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) also released a statement criticizing \u201cfear mongering\u201d and added: \u201cPersonally, I would not send my kids to a school that did not require vaccinations.\u201d", "Title: How the vaccine controversy shows the limits of GOP libertarianism Content: As a demonstration that anything can become political and you never know what issue is going to take over a campaign, every potential presidential candidate is now thinking very carefully about what they should say on the topic of childhood immunizations. Chris Christie kicked things off when he answered a question about a spreading measles outbreak with some comments about parental choice that he sort-of walked back, but the real news came when Rand Paul \u2014 a graduate of Duke University medical school, which I\u2019m fairly certain is a real thing \u2014 gave an interview to CNBC in which he said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Needless to say, this is utterly bogus. What Paul should have noted was that this question has been studied exhaustively, and there is no evidence whatsoever that vaccines cause autism or any other \u201cmental disorder.\u201d But if you thought that every GOP candidate would be rushing to pander to people\u2019s fears about big government forcing them to stick needles in their kids, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact, the ones we\u2019ve heard from so far have been clearly pro-vaccine. And this shows just where the limits of libertarianism within the Republican Party are. As the New York Times noted this morning, Mike Huckabee has in the past advocated that vaccines be widely used, and specifically dismissed the debunked connection to autism, while Rick Perry has also touted his administration\u2019s efforts to increase vaccination. You\u2019ll recall that Perry was criticized by his Republican opponents in 2012 for mandating that girls in Texas public schools receive the HPV vaccine (though he eventually reversed himself when he was convinced by other Texas conservatives that giving a 10-year-old girl a shot to prevent her from getting cervical cancer after she becomes an adult would obviously turn her into a sex maniac). Ben Carson also made clear that mandatory vaccination is critical to preventing disease, no matter what religious or philosophical objections people might have. John Boehner too said that every child should be vaccinated. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico While there are a few candidates we haven\u2019t yet heard from, it may be surprising that Paul isn\u2019t getting more company; indeed, he\u2019s probably surprised, given how much Republicans have talked about individual liberty in the last few years. Paul doesn\u2019t deny that there are risks to not vaccinating children, but he says that it\u2019s a matter of personal freedom: parents, not the government, should make the choice. However, it turns out that other Republicans don\u2019t agree. In this case they believe that the welfare of the community trumps the individual\u2019s right to decide. What that tells us is that the broader Republican commitment to libertarian principles is highly situational. Libertarians laud themselves for their philosophical consistency (though Rand Paul is a quasi-libertarian at most), but ordinary conservatives are picking and choosing based on who\u2019s getting what and who\u2019s paying what. In the case of something like guns, where there\u2019s an analogous situation (individuals want to make a choice that potentially endangers others), conservatives see the gun owner getting a benefit, and one many of them enjoy. When they say that companies should be released from environmental regulations, they\u2019re thinking about people and organizations they admire getting the benefit of unconstrained market freedom, and the cost (environmental degradation) is something they\u2019re only marginally concerned about. But in the case of vaccines, the beneficiaries are a bunch of wackos and conspiracy theorists who are gaining nothing more than the ability to endanger their own children, at the cost of endangering everybody else\u2019s children. And I\u2019m guessing it also matters that a lot of the vaccine truthers who get attention are liberals, the Marin County types who think that because they feed their children organic food that the kids will have super-charged immune systems and therefore can\u2019t become sick. (It should be noted that vaccine trutherism is a non-partisan affliction: liberals are no more likely than conservatives to think vaccines cause autism.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico What\u2019s more, while it\u2019s also true that advocating for vaccines requires conservatives to agree with Science, this issue isn\u2019t like climate change, where many on the right think the entire scientific community is engaged in a vast conspiracy of deception. On climate, people fear that they\u2019ll lose something (like their SUVs) and have to change their lifestyle in order to address the problem; the issue also threatens their traditional allies in the energy industry. There are few such considerations in the vaccine issue. So the vaccine issue demonstrates that while nearly every Republican agrees with libertarian ideas on some issues, this doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect just an inviolable philosophical commitment to individual liberty. When being a libertarian means getting something they want without having to give up anything they like, they\u2019re happy to wave the anti-government flag. But if it means their kids might get sick because some people are dumb enough to take their medical advice from Jenny McCarthy, the needs of the many begin to look much more pressing than the delusions of the few.", "Title: Why parents want to believe in a vaccine conspiracy Content: _Susan Senator lives in Brookline, Mass._ For the first three years of my son\u2019s life, I lived a kind of \u201cGaslight\u201d experience. Sometimes everything seemed fine. But other times, ordinary activities such as piling him into the stroller and going to the park would feel odd somehow, false. Something was not right, but I could not say what or why. I felt as though I was playing the part of mommy, while the real me was clenched up somewhere in the background, nauseated with an unnamed fear for my son. Nat had autism, but I didn\u2019t know it. It was 1993 when he was diagnosed, and no one in my circle had a child with autism or even really knew what it was. When I had Nat evaluated, I asked whether I had caused it. \u201cOh, no, no one believes that anymore,\u201d the doctor said, soothing me with his pragmatic, scientific manner. \u201cAutism is neurological, genetic most likely.\u201d I was grateful to hear this, but only for a little while, because the real problem was still autism. Around the time Nat turned 8, he hit a rough patch that lasted years. He stopped sleeping on any kind of regular nighttime schedule, and he began to exhibit all sorts of difficult behaviors \u2014 false, maniacal laughter, hitting and pinching, breaking things. I didn\u2019t know how to get him to calm down, and I feared for his safety. And because so little was known about autism, no one could really help us. In a way, I found myself back at the beginning, researching the condition, trying to figure out why. Why Nat? Why me? When I came across the theory that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine could cause autism, it made a kind of Old World sense to me. From what I could gather, it sounded as though the vaccine might blow apart some young children\u2019s immune systems, making them susceptible to all kinds of conditions. I was so worn down, so miserable in those days that I was desperate to believe there was a culprit, something or someone to blame. It was a relief to think that the problem wasn\u2019t my DNA but an outside aggressor, a mistake caused by the medical establishment\u2019s hubris. I wondered, if this is true, what should I do? Shouldn\u2019t I sue someone? Kill someone, even? I felt suffocated by anger and horror and also by not knowing what to do next. But the more I thought it through, the less clarity I had. My husband and my mother told me I had to move on, for how could we ever really know whether the vaccine was the cause? I heard them. I also heard the whisper of those very early days with Nat, when doubt needled me. Something had been off \u2014 subtle, but there \u2014 before his vaccinations. So I did more research, and I learned that scientific organizations around the world \u2014 including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health \u2014 had proved the vaccine theory false. No one could say for sure what caused autism, but they certainly could say that it wasn\u2019t a vaccine. In hindsight, it\u2019s easy to understand why some parents of children with autism want to see conspiracy and evil where none exists. Living with a person with autism can be devastatingly difficult, and learning that truth about vaccines didn\u2019t really help me. Autism seemed to have stolen my son, and he was getting worse. He\u2019d been expelled from school for his aggression. I needed help, and his therapists kept quitting because they were afraid of him. I was afraid of him. I was sick of my life. I hung on, of course. Spring came. Somewhere I found the strength to keep my family together and to try one or two new things with Nat, such as signing him up for a Special Olympics gymnastics team. Nat started to do better. Nothing earth-shattering, but he was communicating a little more, and he seemed a bit more tolerant of other people. It was the first time I experienced coming through a bad time, finding a light at the end of the tunnel, with Nat. Now I look back and see that something was indeed shifting in Nat \u2014 and in me. Maybe one influenced the other: He felt my happiness, he grew confident, he succeeded at more things and felt my approval. The change was gradual. Yet it was also all at once. I remember one heart-stopping moment when we shared a laugh on the living room couch, and his warm eyes held mine for a sliver of a second. I knew he was in there, and that was enough. I didn\u2019t get a perfect kid or a perfect life. No one does. But when you\u2019re a young, scared parent, you will grasp at anything to make sense of a hardship such as autism. I know that firsthand. But the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. And more important, autism is not the only tough thing that can happen in this life. A return of deadly diseases kept at bay by vaccines would be far worse. Whatever caused Nat\u2019s autism did not crush him. He is all there. Still very autistic but growing toward the light nevertheless. **Read more on this topic:** Gal Adam Spinrad: I was a vaccine skeptic. Now I\u2019m a believer. Michael Gerson: Vaccines and what we owe to our neighbors", "Title: The origins of Donald Trump\u2019s autism/vaccine theory and how it was completely debunked eons ago Content: Donald Trump confidently strode on stage Wednesday night and explained to millions of Americans on live television his version of the heart-rending science of why so many children are being diagnosed with autism these days. \"You take this little beautiful baby and you pump ... \" he said, referring to mandatory childhood vaccines. \"We had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, 2 years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\" To be fair, as far as medical hypotheses go, Trump's idea is not completely crazy.

[ _So much sweat: Why it was hard for the candidates to look cool during the GOP debate_] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That year, a well-respected journal published a paper by researcher Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues linking a standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism. Despite its tiny sample size of 12 and its speculative conclusions, the study was publicized far and wide -- launching a global movement involving celebrities like Jenny McCarthy, Jim Carrey (and of course Trump) who warned parents to stop vaccinating their children. The result was what public health officials reported was a dangerous drop in MMR vaccinations. The problem: The study was an elaborate fraud. Editors of the Lancet, which published the original piece, discovered that Wakefield had been funded by attorneys for parents who were pursuing lawsuits against vaccine companies and that a number of elements of the paper were misreported. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In February 2010, the journal retracted the piece, and in an investigative piece in 2011, in The BMJ found even more shenanigans in the way the study was conducted. Some parents of children in the study reported by Wakefield to have autism said they did not, and others who were listed in the study as having no problems before the vaccine actually had had developmental issues. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico [ _Carly Fiorina: \"I buried a child to drug addiction.\" How addiction is changing America._ ] *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Journalist Brian Deer wrote: \"No case was free of misreporting or alteration. Taken together ... records cannot be reconciled with what was published, to such devastating effect, in the journal.\" Despite these revelations and reassurances from the federal health officials and other experts that vaccines are safe, the public remained fearful. Much of the alarm came from the case of Hannah Poling -- whose condition after she received five vaccines at 19 months old seemed to confirm every parent's nightmare. Hannah's parents had described their child as interactive, playful and communicative before she got those shots but reported that after she got the vaccine, she develop problems with language, communication and behavior, features of autism spectrum disorder. _[The GOP's dangerous 'debate' on vaccines and autism]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico An article in the New England Journal of Medicine described the drama of what happened after her parents sued the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for compensation under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and won: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The issue became so controversial back then that dozens of studies were launched to address the question Wakefield posed.

One of the largest was published in JAMA in April of this year and looked at 96,000 children in the United States and analyzed which ones got the shot and which ones were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

The American Academy of Pediatrics said that \"claims that vaccines are linked to autism, or are unsafe when administered according to the recommended schedule, have been disproven by a robust body of medical literature.\" Autism Speaks, a science and advocacy group, expressed similar sentiments noting that \"extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism.\" \"The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism,\" the organization said in a statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explicitly states that there is no link between vaccines and autism, that vaccine ingredients do not cause autism and that vaccines in general are very safe. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It cites numerous studies, including a 2013 study that looked at the substances in vaccines that cause the body\u2019s immune system to produce disease- fighting antibodies, showed that the total amount from vaccines received was the same between children with autism and those without. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The CDC said it has looked specifically into thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in multidose vials of vaccines that has been a source of concern among those who believe in an autism-vaccine link, and found no link.

Before you are old enough to drink alcohol, you are offered money \u2014 sometimes a great deal of money \u2014 to pursue that work, with a good probability that the work will someday bring you wealth and fame. Then, fate intervenes \u2014 in the form of injury, illness or the slowly dawning reality that, while you are better than almost everyone else, enough people are better still that you are consigned to a role just outside, and a universe apart from, that inner circle. This is the world that John Feinstein, one of our best-known sportswriters, explores in his new book about the 2012 season of baseball\u2019s International League, one of the two AAA leagues, just below the majors. The book, \u201cWhere Nobody Knows Your Name,\u201d focuses on eight men \u2014 players, managers and an umpire \u2014 each of whom, he writes, \u201cdefines the struggle of people who are extremely good at what they do \u2014 but _not_ as good as they want to be at given moments.\u201d Their stories vary: Pitcher Scott Elarton was a major league star for a season or more until injuries and alcohol left him jobless. John Lindsey spent his entire working life in the minors. (Lindsey, Feinstein tells us, \u201cplayed more minor-league games without a major league call-up than any player in history.\u201d) Managers Charlie Montoyo of the Durham Bulls and Ron Johnson of the Norfolk Tides embrace their roles as mentors to once and future big leaguers, while understanding their players\u2019 discontents. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it here,\u201d Johnson says, \u201cdo a better job.\u201d With many of us counting down to opening day, this is a fitting time for a book whose subtitle might well be \u201chope springs eternal \u2014 every spring.\u201d If you follow baseball, you\u2019ll be struck by the players who appear in these pages, hoping \u2014 sometimes desperately \u2014 for another chance. Here is Mark Prior, the onetime Chicago Cubs ace (he was on the mound in that infamous 2003 playoff game when Cubs fan Steve Bartman reached for a foul ball and doomed the Cubs\u2019 World Series hopes), now six years removed from the majors, pitching for Pawtucket, hoping for an unlikely return to the big time. Here is Dontrelle Willis, 2003 rookie of the year with the world champion Florida Marlins and a 2005 Cy Young contender, plagued by injuries and an anxiety disorder that sent him to seven different teams, fighting for a bullpen role with the Norfolk Tides. More-committed fans may remember the heroics of Scott Posednik, whose home run won a World Series game for the Chicago White Sox, or Dan Johnson, whose two-out, ninth-inning home run on the last day of the 2011 season led to the Tampa Bay Rays\u2019 astonishing capture of a playoff spot. But the bulk of Feinstein\u2019s book, as its title suggests, is about players all but unknown, even to the most obsessive baseball fans; players such as Rich Thompson, who got one major league at-bat for the Kansas City Royals in 2004 \u2014 and then went 2,645 days and 3,711 minor league plate appearances before getting another chance to hit in the majors. \u201cLike every kid who dreamed of playing baseball for a living,\u201d Feinstein writes, \u201che never envisioned eleven different minor-league stops and fourteen seasons riding buses from one small town to another and then one midsize town to another.\u201d This is one of the themes Feinstein hits repeatedly \u2014 sometimes to diminishing effect. Major leaguers fly on charters and sleep in five-star hotels, while minor leaguers travel on buses and sleep in more modest accommodations. The pay disparity is so great that even a short stay in the big leagues can boost a minor leaguer\u2019s paycheck substantially. Minor leaguers don\u2019t exactly root for a major leaguer to be injured, but that\u2019s the most likely way they\u2019ll get a shot at the bigs. The noise in a major league park makes the comparative silence at most minor league games unsettling. \u201cYou can\u2019t make ten thousand people sound like forty thousand people,\u201d says Danny Worth of the Toledo Mud Hens \u2014 as do several others. And there are at least half a dozen instances of the same thought, offered in almost the same words: Maybe I\u2019d rather be playing for a major league team, but I\u2019m being paid to do work that I love. Further, some sections of the book seem like filler: Do we really need a lengthy account of how Jamie Farr\u2019s Klinger character In \u201cM*A*S*H*\u201d made the Toledo Mud Hens famous by wearing their cap onscreen? Still, Feinstein \u2014 a Washington Post columnist and author of two dozen sports books \u2014 is too good at what he does not to offer some arresting stories. The travels and travails of Chris Schwinden, journeying late into the night, fighting plane cancellations and car breakdowns to get to yet another temporary minor league home, shows the price to be paid for following a dream. So are the stories of a broadcaster and an umpire, finally realizing that their aspirations to reach the major leagues are doomed. Because it lacks the kind of powerful personal story that drove Michael Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe Blind Side\u201d (doomed young man turned pro football star thanks to a larger-than-life heroine), \u201cWhere Nobody Knows Your Name\u201d will not appeal to a broad audience. But if you find yourself waiting for ESPN or MLB.TV to start covering the Grapefruit league, Feinstein has provided a welcome pregame companion. **Jeff Greenfield** is a five-time Emmy Award-winning broadcast journalist and the author of 13 books, including, most recently, \u201cIf Kennedy Lived.\u201d **WHERE NOBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME** **Life in the Minor Leagues of Baseball** By John Feinstein Doubleday. 368 pp. $26.95", "Title: Minor league baseball players\u2019 lawsuit alleges that MLB isn\u2019t paying them minimum wage Content: Minor league baseball players have filed a class-action lawsuit against Major League Baseball in U.S. District Court, alleging that the league is violating federal law requiring fair wages and overtime, thus forcing \u201cmany minor leaguers to live in poverty.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday NBC News has more: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday According to NBC News, Major League Baseball denied all the charges in court documents filed in late May, arguing that baseball is more of a pastime than a job. \u201cIf a judge agrees, it could mean that the team owners \u2014 like the owners of water slides in summer and Christmas displays in winter \u2014 are exempt from the need to pay a federal minimum wage. Baseball player, in other words, is no more a career than mall Santa,\u201d NBC\u2019s Tony Dokoupil wrote. The U.S. Supreme Court has long held an interesting view of baseball\u2019s place in society, which could complicate the minor leaguers\u2019 argument. The minor leaguers are alleging a number of violations in their lawsuit: \u2014 \u201cMLB\u2019s longstanding exemption from the United States\u2019 antitrust laws allows it to openly collude on the working conditions for the development of its chief commodity: young baseball players.\u201d \u2014 \u201cMLB continues to actively and openly collude on many aspects of minor leaguers\u2019 working conditions, including, but not limited to, wages, contract terms, drug testing, and discipline. For example, while major leaguers\u2019 salaries have increased by more than 2,000 percent since 1976, monr leaguers\u2019 salaries have, on average, increased only 75 percent since that time. Meanwhile inflation has risen by more than 400 percent over that same time period.\u201d \u2014 \u201cThrough this collective exercise of power, MLB has suppressed minor leaguers\u2019 wages in violation of federal and state law. Most minor leaguers earn between around $3,000 and $7,500 _for the entire year_ despite routinely working over 50 hours per week (and sometimes 70 hours per week) during the roughly five-month championship season. They receive no overtime pay, and instead routinely receive less than minimum wage during the championship season.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday \u2014 \u201cWorse still, the Defendants have conspired to pay now ages at all for significant periods of minor leaguers\u2019 work.

At a the winter meetings last week Brand said MiLB had plans to lobby Congress with the aim of getting an exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act, arguing that minor leaguers are seasonal employees and thus not eligible for federal wage protection. \u201cIn the coming year, we will be seeking legislation to clarify that professional baseball players are not covered by these federal wage and hour laws,\u201d Brand said (via Baseball America). \u201cJust as we did in the 1990s to save the antitrust exemption, we will need your help to explain to our legislators the importance of this issue to the future of minor league baseball and their communities\u2019 investments in stadia and infrastructure. I do not want to overstate the threat this suit presents, but I think my honest assessment is that it is equally perilous for our future as the antitrust repeal was in the 1990s.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico NBC Sports reporter Craig Calcaterra was quick to poke a hole in Brand\u2019s argument, however. He writes that the suit would likely not affect the bottom lines of minor league owners who operate stadiums because MLB pays the minor league players. Calcaterra continues: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Minor league players make base salaries of $5,500 per year. This amount covers only the months of the season and not any training \u2014 including mandatory spring training \u2014 that players generally do to keep fit. They do this, though, because of the dream. If players make it to the majors, they get a 90-fold salary increase. The minimum wage in MLB is $500,000 per year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico This kind of discrepancy between minor league and big league pay is not uncommon, but it is more extreme than even the D-League and the NBA.

He wants to talk to them all, to make everyone who enters the franchise feel at home. He answers questions. He forges relationships. He looks for kids who remind him of what he was at 18. \u201cI was never one of those guys, if somebody would walk in, I\u2019d be the first guy up talking to him,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cI was always kind of laying back, watching, observing. I try to look for that guy in there.\u201d On Monday afternoon at Citi Field in New York, for the fifth consecutive opening day, Desmond will stand at shortstop for the Nationals, a team that existed in the abstract the first time he set foot in that minor league clubhouse. The franchise moved from Montreal to Washington months after it drafted him. A handful of employees \u2014 and just one player \u2014 remain. In her house, Desmond\u2019s mother, Pattie Paradise, keeps the Expos hat and uniform he wore as a minor leaguer. Ten years have passed since Desmond joined the organization. He feels those years \u2014 the roots in Viera and Washington, the connections. If Ryan Zimmerman serves as the face of the franchise, Desmond is the face of the organization hidden from public view. He represents the low-level coaches, the community relations staffers, the minor league players who bustle below the surface. He may know more people in the organization than anyone. He binds them. \u201cThere\u2019s men in this organization that have equally as much invested in me as my own parents,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cI came here when I was basically a boy. They basically can take half the credit of who I\u2019ve become.\u201d Desmond, 28, has become an all-star shortstop and a Silver Slugger winner. He has become a husband to Chelsey, his sweetheart since age 10, and a father to two boys. He has become a board member for the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy and, away from the spotlight, a big brother to a kid fighting a rare and terrible disease. The organization made him a man. He gave the organization a conscience. \u201cHe\u2019s gone from a very talented baseball player to becoming one of the better leaders we have on this team,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cAs you grow up and learn what\u2019s important to you, you do things off the field. I\u2019ve known Desi for a long time, and I\u2019m proud of the person he\u2019s become, the player he\u2019s become.\u201d No one asks Desmond to make trips to the minor league clubhouse, and he wants no publicity for them. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for me,\u201d Desmond said to a reporter. \u201cI prefer to do stuff like that kind of under the radar. I don\u2019t even know how you found out about it.\u201d Mention Desmond to someone within the Nationals\u2019 organization, though, and stories spill forth. In the winter, new Manager Matt Williams asked holdover coaches about team leaders. The response: \u201cDesmond\u2019s your guy.\u201d Coaches in the farm system use Desmond as an example for how minor leaguers should hustle. He stands in front of his locker after every game, inviting reporters to talk to him so teammates can slip out the door. \u201cWe were hitting\u201d in the batting cage, bench coach Randy Knorr said. \u201cGuys were standing around, and they would go, \u2018Boy, that guy\u2019s a leader, man. I\u2019d follow him anywhere.\u2019 These are guys that have been here for a while. To have another player that has played longer than he has to say that is pretty impressive.\u201d Desmond can lead, in part, because of the power of those 10 years. He feels comfortable speaking with any member of the organization, and all of them know they can talk to him. Both his parents still work \u201cprobably more than a millionaire son should let them,\u201d Desmond said. He sees himself as no different from them: blue-collar, regular. \u201cI try to be even with everybody,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cI don\u2019t try to feel like I\u2019m better than anybody. I don\u2019t try to feel like I\u2019m below anybody. I try to just do my work and be relatable to everybody. When everyone does that, you get that community. I just try to do my job and treat people the way I want to be treated. Whether that\u2019s based on my faith or whatever, I just try to be nice to everybody. You know what I mean?\u201d Ethan Brown learned five years ago, at 16, he had contracted neurofibromatosis, a disease commonly known as NF. The disorder makes its victim dangerously susceptible to tumors, particularly in the brain, and in 2012 cancer assaulted Ethan\u2019s body. Before he began chemotherapy, he filled out a prayer request on the Christian Web site Unashamed Athletes. Desmond frequents the Web site and noticed Ethan\u2019s story. He knew nothing about NF. The awfulness of the disease and Brown\u2019s resilience struck him. He started a correspondence with Brown through Twitter. \u201cIt was kind of mind-blowing because I didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d Ethan said in an e-mail. \u201cHe did it on his own.\u201d In April that season, Desmond invited Ethan and his family, who live in South Carolina, to a game in Atlanta. Desmond bought them tickets and brought them on to the field. He asked Ethan whether he had brought a coat. Ethan insisted he would be fine. Desmond walked into the dugout, grabbed his team-issued jacket and gave it to Brown. Desmond would not let the relationship fizzle. They texted, tweeted or talked two or three times each week. They send each other Bible verses. Their favorite is Proverbs 27:17: \u201cAs iron sharpens iron so one friend sharpens another.\u201d \u201cIan\u2019s the big brother I never had,\u201d Brown said. Last year, Desmond invited the Browns to Nationals Park in midsummer. The game fell on a blistering afternoon, so Desmond bought tickets for seats in the shade. Before the game, Desmond toured Ethan through the clubhouse. When he introduced him to teammates, Desmond said, \u201cThis is my friend, Ethan.\u201d \u201cThat made me feel very special,\u201d Ethan said. This winter, Brown\u2019s condition worsened. Tumors formed on his brain stem, his spine and his hands. They surfaced inside and outside his body. They compressed his brain stem. He required three brain surgeries. The operations left him with symptoms of a stroke victim. He needs a wheelchair. His speech slurs. It is difficult for him to swallow. At a Braves game last year, Ethan asked Desmond about his tattoos. Desmond asked Ethan if he had any, and Ethan told him he did not. \u201cWould you get one if I got one?\u201d Desmond asked. Ethan agreed. Desmond created a coat-of-arms design that held meaning for both of them: a shield made of four puzzle pieces, the symbol for NF research. Deer antlers because Brown loves to hunt. Baseball bats for Desmond. A cross. A motto: \u201cEnd NF.\u201d Desmond watched over FaceTime as an artist etched the tattoo on Ethan\u2019s biceps. Sometime this year, Desmond will have the same design inked on his body. In May, NF Awareness Month, Desmond and the people who run Nats Archive \u2014 a fan blog Desmond befriended \u2014 plan to launch an Indiegogo campaign. Desmond wants to raise money for the Children\u2019s Tumor Foundation. More so, he wants people to know about his friend\u2019s disease. Brown amazes and inspires Desmond. He laughs at Ethan\u2019s jokes and marvels at how he stays upbeat as he goes through hell. Daily frustrations make Desmond think of Ethan. His problems become so trivial they vanish. If his friend can keep smiling, Desmond thinks, so can he. The weekend of April 11, the Nationals are playing in Atlanta, and the Browns are going back to Turner Field. \u201cWe don\u2019t care how we get there, if he has to use a wheelchair,\u201d said Rick Brown, Ethan\u2019s father. \u201cHe\u2019s going.\u201d In the summer of 2010, Desmond\u2019s rookie season, a group of local businessmen came to Nationals Park. Marla Lerner Tanenbaum, the chair of the team\u2019s charitable wing, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation, would pitch them on donating to the Nationals Youth Baseball Academy, a place for disadvantaged youth that remained in the infancy of construction. A Nationals player would increase cachet, maybe help raise funds. Desmond volunteered. At 12, Desmond joined an AAU team called the Sarasota Snappers. Two men without children coached the team, and they made him fall in love with baseball. He played 150 games a season \u201cat least,\u201d he says. \u201cThose guys basically kept me off the streets, kept me out of trouble,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cMy eyes were set on becoming a good baseball player. They obviously taught us how to be men. I really owe a lot to them. We had kids on our team that were pretty outcast. They needed this. That\u2019s what we can provide to these kids in D.C. A safe place to go. Why would you not want to help out a kid if he has no love at home or if he\u2019s sleeping on the ground? Not eating dinner? That\u2019s stuff this academy can offer. That\u2019s awesome. I\u2019ll do whatever I got to do for that.\u201d As Desmond shared his story at the meeting, Tanenbaum knew she wanted Desmond to join her cause. \u201cWhen it came time to ask a player to be on the board,\u201d Tanenbaum said, \u201cit was going to be Ian.\u201d During the season, Desmond rarely has time to sit at meetings. He receives group e-mails sent to all the board members. Tanenbaum knows he reads them because he asks her specific questions. Desmond persuaded Mizuno, the equipment company that sponsors him, to donate gloves to every kid in the academy. This summer, he will launch Ian\u2019s Academy All-Stars. Each month, 15 kids and 15 parents from the academy will come to Nationals Park, stand on the field for batting practice, sit in the lower bowl and receive vouchers for concessions. \u201cIan\u2019s paying for all of that,\u201d Tanenbaum said. \u201cThat was his thing. He didn\u2019t want them sitting in the upper bleachers. He wanted them down below.\u201d Tal Alter, the academy\u2019s executive director, received a text message from Desmond in the middle of the night last summer. The Nationals had lost two games in a row to the Phillies. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d Desmond wrote to him. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the academy.\u201d He suggested that the third and fourth graders spend time around sixth and seventh graders, so they can see something to strive toward. Alter put the idea into practice. Desmond sometimes calls or texts Alter and says, \u201cI\u2019ve got some free time today. Take me to meet with some kids.\u201d Desmond makes his visit without fanfare and even without the team\u2019s knowledge. He prefers not to wear his uniform, to make the connection person-to-person, not player-to-fan. \u201cThere\u2019s no show about him,\u201d Alter said. \u201cIt\u2019s all real. He treats everyone like a normal human being.\u201d The simple answer is, Desmond wants to play the rest of his career in Washington. With age, Desmond has learned the complexity of baseball\u2019s business side. In January, after negotiations on a longer deal fell through, Desmond signed a two-year, $17.5 million contract extension. \u201cThat\u2019s a ton of money,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cI don\u2019t really ever think I really deserve it.\u201d And yet a simple conclusion gave to complex reasoning. Desmond and the Nationals struck the deal only after Desmond turned down a long-term contract offer that, based on reports Desmond will not verify, would have paid him almost $90 million over seven seasons. Desmond states his position in a humble manner. \u201cI don\u2019t pretend like I\u2019m some college graduate with a masters in finance,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a high school education. I may or may not have deserved the diploma.\u201d But Desmond is also entrenched in his nuanced stance. He is not greedily demanding more money. He is sacrificing comfort and risking security in the name of players before for him and for the sake of those to follow. \u201cIf you said, \u2018Hey, Ian, we want you to play here for the rest of your career.\u2019 Okay. Yeah, absolutely. Duh. Where do I sign up?\u201d Desmond said. \u201cAt the same time, there have been a lot of people that have come through this game that have sacrificed a lot for us, the players that are coming through now. I don\u2019t want to sign a deal \u2014 and this isn\u2019t to say they\u2019ve offered me this \u2014 but I don\u2019t want to sign a deal that is so bad that a future shortstop gets screwed because I signed a terrible deal. I\u2019m not going to be that guy, that kink in the chain. I\u2019m going to get a fair deal, or I\u2019m just going to wait.\u201d For Desmond, the easy choice would have been to accept the Nationals\u2019 offer. But the Texas Rangers signed Elvis Andrus to an eight-year, $120 million contract two years ago. Desmond did not want to depress the market, no matter how difficult. \u201cSomeone says, \u2018Here\u2019s X dollars,\u2019 and you\u2019re sitting there going, \u2018Man, I couldn\u2019t ever spend this in my whole life.\u2019 How do you turn that down?\u201d Desmond said. \u201cThat\u2019s neither here nor there. My focus is here. I\u2019ve got two more years. They\u2019ve obviously paid me the $17.5 million for the next two years. I\u2019m completely grateful. That\u2019s security enough for my lifetime.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll probably give half of it away,\u201d Knorr said. Desmond likes to point out that, for all his success, he has spent more time in the minors than the majors. Minor league baseball, to him, is \u201cbeautiful.\u201d He loves the purity of young players chasing a livelihood and old players hanging on. Ribald bus rides and hotel card games remain some of his fondest memories. His early days in the majors were miserable. The kinship from his time in the minors disappeared. Players bolted from the stadium after losses. The clubhouse lacked brotherhood. \u201cIf this is what the big leagues is like, I don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Desmond told his mom. \u201cI want to go back to the playing in the minor leagues.\u201d Desmond worked to change that. Before he proposed to Chelsey, Desmond explained requirements for life in baseball. \u201cI was like, look, I\u2019m going to be early to the field \u2014 way earlier than you think is necessary,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to come home way later than you think is necessary. I said, that\u2019s just part of what I do, and that\u2019s how I do it. So if you can accept that, that\u2019s good.\u201d Chelsey nodded. Today, if Desmond heads to the field late, Chelsey asks him, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d When he comes home early, she asks, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cThe culture here has completely changed,\u201d Desmond said. \u201cWe are becoming a family.\u201d Standing in the middle of the diamond, Desmond cultivated that. Knorr, whom Desmond considers a father figure, once told Desmond in Class A he would make the majors strictly because of how he plays the game. He connects to people. He treats them like equals. \u201cHe\u2019s what you would want your son to grow up to be like,\u201d Rick Brown said. Ten years in one place allows so much to happen. A group of people can turn into a family. A city can learn the measure of a man. And an 18-year-old boy can find himself. **More Nationals and baseball coverage** ** ** Boswell: Hope takes flight on opening day Strasburg: \u2018Sky is the limit with this club\u2019 Nationals add two minor league pitchers Zimmerman works through the grind Boswell: What\u2019s a manager worth? 2014 MLB team previews Nationals\u2019 opening day roster", "Title: Emmanuel Burriss returns to D.C. as a National Content: Washington\u2019s native son has been here before. In June 2008, Emmanuel Burriss, the pride of Wilson High and a first-round pick of the San Francisco Giants, played his first game in his home town against the Nationals. This time is different. After a winding path of injuries, struggles, a pit stop in the Cincinnati Reds minor leagues and a decision to sign a minor league deal with his hometown team, Burriss returns to Washington in a more meaningful circumstance. The Nationals called up Burriss last week and Friday he will be in uniform for his hometown team in front of his hometown crowd. The District has a rich baseball history but few products in the majors in recent decades. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cBeing able to put this uniform on, being able to come home for this homecoming is a dream come true,\u201d Burriss said. \u201cSpending those years in the minors sacrificing and putting in that work and dedicating all that time to get here is definitely worth it.\u201d If Burriss appears in any game during his stint with the Nationals, he will become the first D.C.-born baseball player to play for his home town since 1961 when Johnny Klippstein spent one year with the Senators, according to MLB\u2019s official historian John Thorn. Klippstein, however, went to Blair High in Silver Spring and was later a longtime resident of Chicago. Burriss is a Washingtonian from top to bottom. Maury Wills, born in the city and a Cardozo High graduate, is the greatest baseball player the District ever produced but he spent the majority of his career in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform and never got to don his hometown uniform. Burriss gets the chance to represent not only the District but its schools; in 2008, he snapped a 38-year drought without a D.C. public school product in the majors. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cIt means the world to me,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially because in D.C. back then, you weren\u2019t really expected to do too much even if you were a good talent. I\u2019m not just talking me. I\u2019m talking Josh Cribbs, Vernon Davis, those guys were also D.C. public school guys. Growing up, we almost had to fight that barrier of saying we can be from D.C. and DCIAA schooling and still become professional athletes, so it means the world to me.\u201d Burriss, 30, always says he is lucky to have grown up in a household that loved baseball. His father, Allen, grew up in the shadow of Griffith Stadium, went to games because his grandmother gave him 75 cents near-daily to buy a ticket to watch the Senators and eventually played baseball at Theodore Roosevelt High. Burriss grew up playing on the baseball fields of the city, too. Like many baseball fans in the area, Burriss grew up a Baltimore Orioles fan. Baseball returned to the District in 2005, when Burriss was at Kent State University. He was drafted with the 33rd overall pick by the Giants in 2006, and he spent six years in the organization. But when the Nationals were at RFK Stadium, Burriss often dreamed about playing there and for his hometown team. So after Burriss\u2019s Giants tenure ended and he spent one year at the Reds\u2019 Class AAA team, Burriss asked his agent to get in touch with the Nationals. Burriss fixed his swing and enjoyed a strong 2014 season at Class AAA Syracuse, hitting .300 and playing shortstop everyday. He returned this year, was invited to big league spring training and hoped to reach the big leagues again. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That chance nearly came in mid-April when Yunel Escobar hurt his groin and the Nationals brought Burriss to Washington just in case. Burriss\u2019s father drove him to Nationals Park, but Burriss wasn\u2019t activated because Escobar was well enough to play. And finally last week, Burriss was called up \u2014 and activated \u2014 when Anthony Rendon landed on the disabled list. Burriss sent his father a text message with the news. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey dad, it\u2019s official,'\u201d Allen Burriss said. \u201cIt brought tears to my eyes.\u201d A large contingent of friends and family were expected at Nationals Park on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people are coming but I know it\u2019s gonna be a lot,\u201d Burriss said. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about it. I told my parents not to tell me. \u2026 It\u2019s gonna be hectic. I\u2019m looking forward to it, but at the same time, I\u2019m like, man this might be crazy.\u201d Burriss still lives and trains out in Northwest during the offseason. When he meets local little leaguers, Burriss is filled with pride. \u201cI hope to be an inspiration to these kids,\u201d Burriss said. \u201cI know when I go talk to the little leaguers I know how excited some of them are to talk to me, even when I told them I was a Triple-A baseball player for a few years. For me, that\u2019s amazing, seeing the kids looking at me and thinking about playing major league baseball and baseball in general.\u201d Burriss believes the current generation of young baseball players are fortunate to grow up in a city with a baseball team. \u201cThat\u2019s something else,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lord works in mysterious ways. And now to see my son. To have Burriss on his back and the W on the front.

The Drug Enforcement Administration targeted these middlemen for a simple reason. If the agency could force the companies to police their own drug shipments, it could keep millions of pills out of the hands of abusers and dealers. That would be much more effective than fighting \u201cdiversion\u201d of legal painkillers at each drugstore and pain clinic. Many companies held back drugs and alerted the DEA to signs of illegal activity, as required by law. But others did not. Collectively, 13 companies identified by The Washington Post knew or should have known that hundreds of millions of pills were ending up on the black market, according to court records, DEA documents and legal settlements in administrative \u00adcases, many of which are being reported here for the first time. Even when they were alerted to suspicious pain clinics or pharmacies by the DEA and their own employees, some distributors ignored the warnings and continued to send drugs. \u201cThrough the whole supply chain, I would venture to say no one was doing their job,\u201d said Joseph T. Rannazzisi, former head of the DEA\u2019s Office of Diversion Control, who led the effort against distributors from 2005 until shortly before his retirement in 2015. \u201cAnd because no one was doing their job, it just perpetuated the problem. Corporate America let their profits get in the way of public health.\u201d A review of the DEA\u2019s campaign against distributors reveals the extent of the companies\u2019 role in the diversion of opioids. It shows how drugs intended for millions of legitimate pain patients ended up feeding illegal users\u2019 appetites for prescription narcotics. And it helps explain why there has been little progress in the U.S. opioid epidemic, despite the efforts of public-health and enforcement agencies to stop it. At the peak of the crisis, the DEA retreated from the battle. A Post investigation published Saturday revealed that beginning in 2013, some officials at DEA headquarters began to block and delay enforcement actions against wholesale drug distributors and others, frustrating investigators in the field. Several former DEA officials told The Post that the shift in approach undercut the cases\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad against some of these distributors, who were ignoring signs that their customers were ordering suspicious quantities of narcotics. \u201cWe could not get these cases\u00ad through headquarters,\u201d said Frank Younker, a DEA supervisor in the Cincinnati field office who retired in 2014 after a 30-year career. \u201cWe were trying to shut off the flow, and we just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d The 13 companies include Fortune 25 giants McKesson, Cardinal Health and Amerisource\u00adBergen, which together control about 85 percent of all pharmaceutical distribution in the United States. They also include regional wholesalers such as Miami-Luken and KeySource Medical, both based in Ohio, as well as Walgreens, the nation\u2019s largest retail drugstore chain. Many of the distributors are tiny operations with just a few employees. It is not clear how many other \u00adcases exist. Because the DEA handles its enforcement actions administratively, few details surface unless the agency or the company discloses them, or if one side appeals in civil court. The DEA declined to disclose how many enforcement actions it has brought against distributors, requiring a Freedom of Information Act request that The Post filed in April. The request is pending. The DEA also would not make any officials available to discuss this article, but it provided a statement from acting administrator Chuck Rosenberg defending the agency\u2019s enforcement actions. \u201cWe now have good folks in place and are moving in the right direction,\u201d he said. Some of the 13 companies have fought the DEA\u2019s enforcement efforts in court and in hearings before the agency\u2019s administrative law judges. Except in two pending \u00adcases, all have lost or settled. Using its civil authority, the DEA stopped the flow of narcotics from some company warehouses, and U.S. attorneys levied fines totaling more than $286 million. Most of the 13 **** wholesalers involved in these \u00adcases\u00ad declined to be interviewed. In court filings and congressional testimony, they said they have developed large and sophisticated systems to help prevent drug diversion. They have complained that it is difficult to police the activities of far-flung drug dispensers and have noted that drugs could not be sold to illegal users without prescriptions written by corrupt doctors. They also criticized the DEA\u2019s past approach to the problem as punitive and its rules as vague and confusing. But the problem is clearly ongoing. Prescription narcotics cause more overdose deaths every year than any street drug, including heroin. The painkiller epidemic has taken 165,000 lives since the turn of the century, with the number of deaths soaring from 3,785 in 2000 to 14,838 in 2014. Opioid overdoses, mainly from prescription drugs, are also the leading cause of the recent unexpected rise in the mortality rate of middle-aged white Americans, particularly women in rural areas, after decades of steady decline. But it is impossible to estimate how much of the opioid supply is siphoned away to illicit use. \u201cNo one knows, because it\u2019s impossible to track what happens to an individual prescription once it leaves the pharmacist,\u201d said Susan Awad, director of advocacy and government relations for the American Society of Addiction Medicine. One of the first wholesalers targeted by the DEA under its \u201cDistributor Initiative\u201d was Southwood Pharmaceuticals, a small company based in Lake Forest, Calif., that sent controlled substances to Internet pharmacies. Because these online businesses typically allowed people to obtain drugs without being seen by a doctor, they were ripe for abuse. In 2005, for example, Southwood supplied one Florida online drugstore, Medipharm-Rx, with 8.6 million \u00addoses of hydrocodone \u2014 the opioid found in Vicodin and Lortab, according to the DEA. But Southwood failed to file a single suspicious order report, even after the DEA warned the company in July 2006 about the growth in the volume of its shipments. The DEA had seen the trend in its own monitoring of drug-sales data. \u201cEven after being advised by agency officials that its internet pharmacy customers were likely engaged in illegal activity, [Southwood] failed miserably to conduct adequate due diligence,\u201d Michele Leonhart, then the DEA\u2019s deputy administrator, wrote in a 2007 decision to revoke the company\u2019s license to distribute narcotics. \u201cThe direct and foreseeable consequence of the manner in which [Southwood] conducted its due diligence program was the likely diversion of millions of dosage units of hydrocodone,\u201d Leonhart wrote, adding that the company had reason to know that the 44 million \u00addoses of hydrocodone it distributed were probably being diverted. That amount would provide a 30-day supply of narcotics for everyone in the city of Dallas, according to Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management company. Southwood got out of the business of selling controlled sub\u00adstances and six years later lost its pharmacy license in California. The company\u2019s president, John Sempre, ****recently told The Post that ****the company did not understand at first that it was supplying Internet pharmacies. He said it is very difficult for companies to monitor the sales of faraway retailers. \u201cIf companies like McKesson can\u2019t control it, what does that tell you?\u201d Sempre asked. **** In 2008, McKesson, the nation\u2019s largest drug distributor, settled a case that accused three of its U.S. warehouses of failing to report hundreds of suspicious orders from Internet pharmacies. \u201cAs a result, millions of doses of controlled substances were diverted from legitimate channels of distribution,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release. The company paid a $13 million fine to U.S. attorney\u2019s offices in Florida, Maryland, Colorado, Texas, Utah and California. \u201cBy failing to report suspicious orders for controlled sub\u00adstances that it received from rogue Internet pharmacies, the McKesson Corporation fueled the explosive prescription drug abuse problem we have in this country,\u201d Leonhart, then the acting DEA administrator, said in a statement at the time. Seven years later, after being caught up in a second diversion case, McKesson agreed to pay a $150 million fine and accepted license suspensions at four warehouses, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. No other details of that case have become public, and both the company and the DEA declined to discuss it. A McKesson spokeswoman said in a statement to The Post, \u201cWe welcome the ongoing dialogue with the DEA aimed at developing effective controlled sub\u00adstances monitoring programs and successfully mitigating prescription drug abuse and diversion.\u201d AmerisourceBergen, another member of the so-called Big Three distributors, lost its license to send controlled sub\u00adstances from an Orlando warehouse on April 24, 2007, amid allegations that it was not controlling shipments of hydrocodone to Internet pharmacies. The facility was back in business by August of that year and did not pay a fine, according to a company spokeswoman. Few details of the case have surfaced. Cardinal, the third member of the Big Three, paid a $34 million fine in 2008 after seven of its warehouses across the country filled thousands of suspicious orders from Internet pharmacies without reporting them, despite an earlier warning from the DEA, according to a Justice Department news release. On Oct. 5, 2010, when Cardinal investigator Vincent Moellering visited Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy , a drugstore in Fort Myers, Fla., he found evidence of diversion everywhere, records show, including suspicious customers who came in groups to fill their prescriptions. The pharmacy\u2019s owner told Moellering that he could sell even more narcotics if Cardinal would supply them, according to Moellering\u2019s report, which the DEA introduced in a court proceeding. Moellering labeled the drugstore \u201chigh risk\u201d and wrote: \u201cI am not convinced that the owner is being forthright pertaining to his customers\u2019 origin or residence. I have requested permission to contact DEA to resolve this issue.\u201d But Cardinal didn\u2019t notify the agency or cut off Gulf Coast\u2019s drug supply, the DEA contends. Instead, the shipments kept going out. In 2011 alone, Cardinal sent more than 2 million \u00addoses of oxycodone to Gulf Coast. Cardinal typically shipped 65,000 \u00addoses of the opioid annually to comparable pharmacies, the DEA said. Even as Cardinal was increasing its shipments to Gulf Coast, another wholesale drug distributor, H.D. Smith, was cutting off its supply of painkillers to the pharmacy. Smith took action after one of its compliance officers visited Gulf Coast and found \u201cimpaired and lethargic\u201d customers \u201cwith glassy eyes\u201d in November 2010, a few weeks after Moellering\u2019s visit, court records show. The Smith inspector learned that the pharmacy filled 300 prescriptions a day, nearly half for controlled substances. Smith considered anything over 20 percent to be a red flag. Gulf Coast owner Jeffrey R. Green and manager Karen S. Hebble sometimes waited after hours to sell narcotics, even without a pharmacist present, court records show. Drug dealers said they brought groups of fake patients \u2014 known in the trade as \u201cspuds\u201d or \u201cskidoodies\u201d \u2014 to Gulf Coast to fill bogus prescriptions obtained from cooperating prescribers, court records state. They always paid cash. One drug dealer would call ahead to make sure Gulf Coast had enough pills for his fake customers. Cardinal only stopped shipments to Gulf Coast in October 2011, shortly before the DEA demanded information from the distributor. The next month, Gulf Coast surrendered its license. Green and Hebble were ultimately convicted in federal court of conspiracy and money-laundering \u00adcharges. Cardinal contended that volume of drug sales alone is not an accurate measure of lack of compliance. The company noted that Gulf Coast served a hospital complex and hundreds of physicians. In 2012, Cardinal settled the administrative case, but no fine has been levied. Negotiations are ongoing, according to a federal prosecutor and the company. In a statement to The Post, Brett Ludwig, Cardinal\u2019s vice president of public relations, said the company deploys \u201cadvanced analytics, technology, and teams of \u00adanti-diversion specialists and investigators who are embedded in our supply chain. This ensures that we are as effective and efficient as possible in constantly monitoring, identifying, and eliminating any outside criminal activity.\u201d At Walgreens, an employee at one of the 13 ware\u00adhouses the drugstore chain operated in the United States grew suspicious of the large orders being sent to some of its pharmacies, court records show. Kristine Atwell, who managed distribution of controlled substances for the company\u2019s warehouse in Jupiter, Fla., sent an email on Jan. 10, 2011, to corporate headquarters urging that some of the stores be required to justify their large quantity of orders. \u201cI ran a query to see how many bottles we have sent to store #3836 and we have shipped them 3271 bottles between 12/1/10 and 1/10/11,\u201d Atwell wrote. [A bottle sent by a wholesaler generally contains 100 doses.] \u201cI don\u2019t know how they can even house this many bottle[s] to be honest. How do we go about checking the validity of these orders?\u201d Walgreens never checked, the DEA said. Between April 2010 and February 2012, the Jupiter distribution center sent 13.7 million oxycodone \u00addoses to six Florida stores, records show \u2014 many times the norm, the DEA said. In March 2011, the situation became so alarming at two Walgreens drugstores in the small town of Oviedo, Fla., that Police Chief Jeffrey Chudnow wrote to the company\u2019s top executives, Alan G. McNally, who was chairman; and Gregory D. Wasson, then the president and chief executive. Chudnow asked that they prohibit Walgreens pharmacists from filling orders where the quantities of narcotics were split over two prescriptions. \u201cThese types of prescriptions overtly denote misuse and possible street sales of these drugs,\u201d Chudnow wrote. He said he never heard back from the executives. In 2012, the DEA launched a six-month investigation of Walgreens\u2019s Jupiter facility. The probe found that Walgreens failed to maintain an effective system for detecting suspicious orders or reporting them to the DEA. Even when suspicious orders were identified, the warehouse often shipped the drugs anyway, without making inquiries, the DEA said in court papers. A company spokesman said Walgreens would have no comment on the case. Walgreens settled with the DEA in 2013, agreeing to pay an $80 million fine \u2014 a record for a diversion case at the time. The company acknowledged that its \u201csuspicious order reporting for distribution to certain pharmacies did not meet the standards identified by DEA.\u201d In 2013, DEA officials at the agency\u2019s headquarters began requiring a higher burden of proof before investigators in the field could take enforcement action. One case that was underway became entangled in that shift, according to interviews and records. Beginning in 2011, the DEA had repeatedly warned Miami-Luken, an Ohio-based distributor, about suspicious sales of opioids, according to Jim Geldhof, then the agency\u2019s program manager in Detroit. \u201cWe went to management of the company and told them they have to look at their sales. They are pretty extraordinary,\u201d said Geldhof, who retired in January after more than four decades with the agency. \u201cWe spoke to them on multiple occasions, and we were pretty much ignored.\u201d Yet investigators couldn\u2019t persuade lawyers at DEA headquarters to allow them to take action. Geldhof said orders to show cause that he requested in 2013 were not issued until November 2015. \u201cIt sat there for two years. I don\u2019t know why there was a delay,\u201d Geldhof said. \u201cWe went back and forth. The ball was always moving. We had all of this going on, overdose deaths, what part of this are we not getting them to understand. We said, \u2018You tell us what you want and we\u2019ll give it to you.\u2019 \u201d Inside Miami-Luken headquarters, employees had also seen troubling signs. Two of them sent word up the chain. A pharmaceutical buyer and a customer-service representative were concerned about large oxycodone orders by a southern Ohio pain clinic. The warnings reached senior company officials, including then-chief executive Anthony Rattini. But little changed. Cindy Willet, the senior pharmaceutical buyer, told investigators in 2015 that she eventually \u201cstopped talking to [Rattini] about her concerns because he wasn\u2019t doing anything about it. It was as if it was falling on deaf ears. Tony never stopped an order.\u201d Last year, a federal grand jury indicted the Temponerases and a pharmacist on charges that they conspired to illegally sell medication, alleging that at least eight people had died of over\u00addoses connected to the drugs. Three of those people died while the clinic was receiving drugs from Miami-Luken between November 2008 and August 2010, according to the indictment and DEA records. It is unclear whether Margy Temponeras also purchased drugs from other distributors, or whether any of those who died consumed drugs distributed by Miami-Luken. The Temponerases are scheduled to stand trial early next year. Their attorneys declined to comment. An attorney for the pharmacist, Raymond Fankell, who is also scheduled to stand trial next year, said Fankell\u2019s involvement was limited to helping Margy Temponeras set up the dispensary in her office and to filling her prescriptions at his drugstore. During one of their interviews with Rattini, DEA investigators asked how the company documented suspicious orders. Rattini pointed to his compliance officer, who put a finger to his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all just up here,\u201d he said. The company said in court filings that it has purchased software to better identify suspicious orders and added staff to its compliance efforts. Its chairman, Joseph Mastandrea, intends to testify that he removed Rattini from his role supervising compliance \u201cas DEA\u2019s inquiries increased\u201d and that he \u201crealized that Mr. Rattini was not fulfilling the company\u2019s DEA compliance obligations,\u201d according to court filings. Rattini did not return calls seeking comment. The chairman \u201cwill accept responsibility for the company\u2019s past failings,\u201d the court documents state. **Unnatural causes: Sick and dying in small-town America** This story is part of a series exploring the rise in death rates among middle- aged white women and the forces driving it. Read previous stories from this series here.", "Title: Investigation: The DEA slowed enforcement while the opioid epidemic grew out of control Content: **UNNATURAL CAUSES** SICK AND DYING IN SMALL-TOWN AMERICA: _Since the turn of this century, rates have risen for whites in midlife, particularly women.In this series, The Washington Post is exploring this trend and the forces driving it. Related: Wholesalers sent pills to drugstores that fueled the opioid epidemic _ A decade ago, the Drug \u00adEnforcement Administration launched an aggressive campaign to curb a rising opioid epidemic that was claiming thousands of American lives each year. The DEA began to target wholesale companies that distributed hundreds of millions of highly addictive pills to the corrupt pharmacies and pill mills that illegally sold the drugs for street use. Leading the campaign was the agency\u2019s Office of Diversion Control, whose investigators around the country began filing civil cases against the distributors, issuing orders to immediately suspend the flow of drugs and generating large fines. But the industry fought back. Former DEA and Justice Department officials hired by drug companies began pressing for a softer approach. In early 2012, the deputy attorney general summoned the DEA\u2019s diversion chief to an unusual meeting over a case against two major drug companies. \u201cThat meeting was to chastise me for going after industry, and that\u2019s all that meeting was about,\u201d recalled Joseph T. Rannazzisi, who ran the diversion office for a decade before he was removed from his position and retired in 2015. Rannazzisi vowed after that meeting to continue the campaign. But soon officials at DEA headquarters began delaying and blocking enforcement actions, and the number of cases plummeted, according to on-the-record interviews with five former agency supervisors and internal records obtained by The Washington Post. The judge who reviews the DEA diversion office\u2019s civil caseload noted the plunge. \u201cThere can be little doubt that the level of administrative Diversion enforcement remains stunningly low for a national program,\u201d Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. Mulrooney II wrote in a June 2014 quarterly report obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. In fiscal 2011, civil case filings against distributors, manufacturers, pharmacies and doctors reached 131 before dropping to 40 in fiscal 2014, according to the Justice Department. The number of immediate suspension orders, the DEA\u2019s strongest weapon of enforcement, dropped from 65 to nine during the same period. \u201cThings came to a grinding halt,\u201d said Frank Younker, a DEA supervisor in the Cincinnati field office who retired in 2014 after 30 years with the agency. \u201cI talked to my fellow supervisors, and we were all frustrated. It was ridiculous. I don\u2019t know how many lives could have been saved if the process was done quicker.\u201d The slowdown began in 2013 after DEA lawyers started requiring a higher standard of proof before cases could move forward. Top officials at the DEA and Justice declined to discuss the reasons behind the slowdown in the approval of enforcement cases. The DEA turned down requests by The Post to interview Mulrooney, acting DEA administrator Chuck Rosenberg, chief counsel Wendy H. Goggin and Rannazzisi\u2019s replacement, Louis J. Milione. The agency provided a statement from Rosenberg: \u201cWe combat the opioid crisis in many ways: criminally, civilly, administratively, and through robust demand reduction efforts. \u201cWe implemented new case intake and training procedures for our administrative cases, increased the number of enforcement teams focused on criminal and civil investigations, restarted a successful drug take back program, and improved outreach to \u2014 and education efforts with \u2014 our registrant community. \u201cWe have legacy stuff we need to fix, but we now have good folks in place and are moving in the right direction.\u201d The Justice Department, which oversees the DEA, declined requests to interview Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates. The department issued a statement saying that the drop in diversion cases reflects a shift from crackdowns on \u201cubiquitous pill mills\u201d toward a \u201csmall group\u201d of doctors, pharmacists and companies that continues to violate the law. Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said diversion investigators are also increasingly using criminal procedures to force targets to surrender their licenses without administrative hearings. \u201cAlthough these reasons largely account for the decline in administrative case filings, the department remains committed to eliminating the problem of opioid abuse,\u201d Carr said, pointing out that the diversion control chief had recently been elevated to a \u201ctop leadership post.\u201d But Justice statistics show that surrenders of licenses have remained relatively constant since 2011 before dropping by more than a third in the last fiscal year. Carr could not say how many were tied to DEA enforcement actions. The former agency supervisors said the majority of surrenders do not involve DEA enforcement actions. The epidemic began in the late 1990s after the introduction of the powerful, long-acting opioid OxyContin and an aggressive marketing campaign by the drug\u2019s manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, to persuade doctors to prescribe it for all kinds of pain. A new philosophy of pain management resulted in a surge in demand and the U.S. addiction rate. From 2000 to 2014, 165,000 people died of overdoses of prescription painkillers nationwide. The crisis has also fostered follow-on epidemics of heroin, which caused nearly 55,000 overdose deaths in the same period, and fentanyl, which has killed thousands more. The number of U.S. opioid prescriptions has risen from 112 million in 1992 to 249 million in 2015. Several DEA officials on the front lines of the opioid war said they could not persuade headquarters to approve their cases at the peak of the epidemic. They said they confronted Clifford Lee Reeves II, a lawyer in charge of approving their cases, to no avail. Through a DEA spokesman, Reeves declined to comment for this report. Jim Geldhof had been with the DEA for nearly four decades and was serving as the diversion program manager in the Detroit field office when Reeves took over at DEA headquarters in 2012. \u201cIt was like he was on their side, not ours,\u201d said Geldhof, who retired in January. \u201cI don\u2019t know what his motive was, but we had people dying. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be more aggressive. We were in the throes of a major pill epidemic.\u201d In the field, Younker and other DEA supervisors said they grew to distrust Reeves and became suspicious about what was taking place at headquarters. \u201cWe all had a feeling that someone put him there to purposely stonewall these cases,\u201d Younker said. Kathy Chaney, who served as the DEA\u2019s group supervisor in Columbus, Ohio, saw the problem play out firsthand. She was responsible for 35 counties in Ohio and had overseen the agency\u2019s efforts to curb prescription painkiller abuse in cities such as Chillicothe and Portsmouth, both at ground zero of the opioid crisis. She said one of her cases against a distributor languished for years without action. The experience was particularly difficult, Chaney said, because she had been meeting with parents of children who had died of overdoses of oxycodone and other painkillers. \u201cWe got so frustrated, I finally told my group, \u2018We\u2019re not going to send any cases up to headquarters,\u2019 \u201d said Chaney, who retired in 2013. \u201cIn 25 years, I had never seen anything like it. It was one of the reasons I left. Morale was terrible. I couldn\u2019t get anything done. It was almost like being invisible.\u201d *** In 2004, the leaders of the DEA\u2019s diversion office became alarmed by the rising number of overdose deaths amid a growing supply of prescription painkillers. Online pharmacies were flourishing, making it easy to buy powerful painkillers such as oxycodone and hydrocodone. The death toll had hit 8,577, a 15 percent jump in one year. Pain-management clinics began popping up around the country. DEA diversion investigators soon realized that they were playing a real-life game of Whac-a-Mole. As soon as they shut down one facility, another would appear. \u201cPeople were dying,\u201d said William J. Walker, a 31-year DEA veteran who headed the diversion office in 2004 and 2005. Walker set up tactical units around the country to investigate doctors, pharmacists, distributors and manufacturers. \u201cWe had a multilayered threat, and there was a tremendous sense of urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cI turned up the heat on the workforce, and we started getting after it.\u201d Toward the end of 2005, Walker, a brigadier general in the National Guard, was called up for active duty and left the office. Taking his place was his top deputy, Joseph Rannazzisi, a street-smart New Yorker who held degrees in pharmacy and law. He had begun his career as a DEA street agent and then a supervisor in Detroit before working his way to the top of the diversion office at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Va. Rannazzisi decided to focus on the source of the pills: the wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals. Drugs are manufactured by high-profile corporations such as Purdue Pharma. They rely on a lesser-known network of distributors, some of which are also multinational corporations. The distributors serve as middlemen, sending billions of doses of opioid pain pills to pharmacists, hospitals, nursing homes and pain clinics. The U.S. prescription opioid market generates $10 billion in annual sales. There are thousands of distributors among the 1.6 million people and companies that hold DEA licenses to dispense drugs, but three of them \u2014 McKesson, Amerisource\u00adBergen and Cardinal Health \u2014 account for 85 percent of the drug shipments in the United States. These companies, which together collect about $400 billion in annual revenue, supply the corner pharmacist as well as giant medical centers. For years, the DEA had taken a hands-off approach to the prescription drugs flowing out of the distributors. The companies had been reporting their drug sales inconsistently or not at all. They had been largely left alone as the DEA focused on doctors and pharmacies. \u201cThe distributors had been ignored for years and years and years,\u201d John J. Coleman, the third-ranking administrator at the DEA in the mid-1990s, said in a recent interview. In 2005, the Office of Diversion Control, under Rannazzisi, launched its \u201cDistributor Initiative\u201d and briefed 76 companies about it. The new campaign pitted the DEA against an industry with close ties to lobbyists, lawyers and politicians in Washington. On Sept. 27, 2006, the diversion office sent a letter to distributors across the country, reminding them that they were required by law to ensure that their drugs were not being diverted to the black market. \u201cGiven the extent of prescription drug abuse in the United States, along with the dangerous and potentially lethal consequences of such abuse, even just one distributor that uses its DEA registration to facilitate diversion can cause enormous harm,\u201d Rannazzisi wrote in the letter. Five months later, D. Linden Barber, then-associate chief counsel for the DEA diversion office, wrote to DEA supervisors across the country, telling them to be vigilant. Abuse of prescription drugs, he said, had become \u201cgreater than the abuse of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine.\u201d Under Rannazzisi\u2019s initiative, distributors would have to monitor their sales in real time, withhold drug shipments if they detected suspicious activity and report those red flags to the DEA. The diversion office deployed two weapons to ensure compliance. The first was an \u201corder to show cause,\u201d which permits investigators to begin a process to stop drug shipments from warehouses. The second was an \u201cimmediate suspension order,\u201d which allows the DEA to instantly freeze shipments of narcotics from facilities where an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to public health exists. The immediate suspension order was especially dreaded by the distributors. Younker, the former DEA supervisor in Cincinnati, said the agency had no other choice. \u201cThe distributors could have stopped what was going on, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were doing the bare minimum. Why would you want to cut off a customer that\u2019s paying you $2 million a year? They have sales reps and sales quotas and bonus structures and employees of the month. Everyone was making a lot of money.\u201d The DEA diversion office started small. Investigators targeted Southwood Pharmaceuticals, a mom-and-pop distributor in Lake Forest, Calif., where shipments of hydrocodone had skyrocketed over nine months in 2005, from 7,000 doses per month to 3 million. Southwood eventually lost its license to dispense controlled substances. In 2007, the DEA raised its sights, bringing an enforcement case against McKesson \u2014 now the nation\u2019s largest drug distributor and the fifth-largest corporation in the country. The DEA accused the company of failing to report hundreds of suspicious orders from online pharmacies. \u201cAs a result, millions of dosage units of controlled substances were diverted from legitimate channels of distribution,\u201d a Justice Department news release said in 2008. Without admitting liability, McKesson eventually settled the case, agreeing to pay a $13 million fine. That same year, the diversion office filed a case against Cardinal Health, another member of the Big Three wholesalers. DEA investigators alleged that the company was sending millions of doses of painkillers to online and retail pharmacies without alerting investigators to an obvious sign of illegal diversion. Cardinal settled the allegations in 2008, paying a $34 million fine without acknowledging wrongdoing and promising to improve its monitoring of suspicious orders. Cardinal\u2019s chief executive at the time said the company had spent $20 million to control diversion and took its responsibility \u201cvery seriously.\u201d Still, the painkiller crisis raged. In 2008, 13,149 people died of opioid overdoses. The next year, a federal law made it illegal to distribute controlled substances online and required doctors to see their patients face-to-face before writing prescriptions. By now, the DEA\u2019s campaign was broad and deep. Mulrooney, the agency\u2019s chief law judge, noted in an internal report that the agency had filed 115 charging documents in 2010, including 52 immediate suspension orders. \u201cProgress,\u201d the chief judge wrote, noting that all pending cases were scheduled for hearings. \u201cThis has not been true for as long as anyone here can remember.\u201d In late 2011, Rannazzisi\u2019s office filed warrants to yet again inspect the records of a Cardinal warehouse. Investigators alleged that the company was overlooking escalating oxycodone orders from pharmacies in Florida. The DEA was also targeting four drugstores supplied by Cardinal in the state, including two CVS pharmacies. Rannazzisi\u2019s office obtained an internal Cardinal email from 2010 showing that the company\u2019s own investigator had warned against selling narcotics to Gulf Coast Medical Pharmacy, an independent drugstore in Fort Myers, Fla., citing suspicions that the pills were winding up on the street. Despite the warning, Cardinal hadn\u2019t notified the DEA or cut off the supply of drugs. Instead, the company shipped increasing quantities of pain pills to Gulf Coast. In 2011 alone, Cardinal sent more than 2 million doses of oxycodone to Gulf Coast. The wholesaler typically shipped 65,000 doses annually to comparable pharmacies. \u201cI had the case of my dreams,\u201d Rannazzisi said. About Thanksgiving in 2011, Rannazzisi said that he received an unexpected phone call. It was from James H. Dinan, then-chief of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces program at the Justice Department. Dinan worked with then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, the second-most-powerful Justice Department official after Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Rannazzisi said Dinan told him: \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls from attorneys, former Justice people, that are saying you guys are doing some enforcement action.\u201d Rannazzisi said he told Dinan that warrants for Cardinal records had already been served. Among the attorneys representing Cardinal at the time were two former deputy attorneys general, Jamie S. Gorelick, who served in the Clinton administration, and Craig S. Morford, who served in the George W. Bush administration. Both contacted the DEA, records show. Gorelick did not respond to requests for an interview. Morford declined to comment. Instead, Cardinal referred questions to Barber, the former DEA associate chief counsel in charge of diversion litigation, who joined the law firm Quarles & Brady and is now representing distributors. Barber told The Post that there was nothing unusual about Morford contacting the agency. \u201cIt was not anything other than \u2018we\u2019d like to sit down and have a discussion at an early stage of the investigation,\u2019 \u201d Barber said. On Feb. 1, 2012, as Rannazzisi was preparing to sign off on immediate suspension orders against Cardinal and CVS, he said he received another call from Dinan. Rannazzisi said Dinan told him that Cole, the deputy attorney general, known in the department as the \u201cDAG,\u201d was demanding a briefing before the suspension orders were executed. The next morning, at 1:36 a.m., Dinan followed up with an email. \u201cPlease call me in the morning,\u201d he wrote, according to Rannazzisi. \u201cI want to make double sure nothing unreversible happens before the DAG is briefed as we talked about at Thanksgiving.\u201d That morning, Rannazzisi went to the Justice Department in Washington to meet with a number of officials, including Cole; Dinan; Goggin, the DEA\u2019s top lawyer; and Stuart M. Goldberg, Cole\u2019s chief of staff. Rannazzisi said Goldberg did most of the talking. \u201cHe asked me a question about what my goals were in this case, and why I was going after these corporations,\u201d Rannazzisi said. \u201cI said, \u2018Before I answer that, I\u2019ve got to ask you: I\u2019ve done hundreds of these cases, and I\u2019ve never been called over to the Justice Department to explain myself. I\u2019m just curious why this case is so important.\u2019 \u201d Rannazzisi said Cole interrupted. \u201cBecause I\u2019m the deputy attorney general of the United States, and I want to know about it,\u201d he recalled Cole saying. \u201cThen I say, \u2018Well, that doesn\u2019t really answer the question,\u2019 \u201d Rannazzisi said. The meeting went downhill from there. \u201cIt spiraled out of control,\u201d Rannazzisi said. \u201cIt got very adversarial.\u201d Cole, who is now a partner at the Washington law firm Sidley Austin, disputed Rannazzisi\u2019s characterization of the meeting. \u201cMy conversation with Mr. Rannazzisi was simply to confirm whether or not he had refused to meet with Cardinal regarding a potential DEA action and, if so, share my view that it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say,\u201d Cole said in a statement. \u201cHearing what Cardinal had to say could inform DEA of facts they may not have known. I did not tell Mr. Rannazzisi how to come out on the Cardinal matter and certainly did not discourage him from going after any company in violation of any statutes or regulations,\u201d he said. Dinan, now the principal assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, declined to comment through a spokesman. Goldberg and Holder did not respond to requests for an interview. Rannazzisi said he left the meeting undeterred. The same day, his office filed the suspension order against Cardinal, and two days later, DEA investigators shut down the two CVS pharmacies. A week later, DEA officials said in court documents that Cardinal\u2019s activities constituted \u201can imminent danger to the public health or safety.\u201d As the cases were pending, Goggin wrote to Rannazzisi to inform him that CVS was attempting to go around the agency by appealing to the office of the deputy attorney general, known as ODAG. \u201cCVS lawyers (who used to work at DOJ) are trying to do an end run with ODAG,\u201d Goggin wrote, according to Rannazzisi. \u201cThey want (1) to get the administrator to hold off issuing a final order until we are able (presumably) to try and work out a settlement.\u201d In his statement, Cole said, \u201cI do not recall having any involvement with CVS matters while at DOJ.\u201d Final orders make cases\u00ad public because the decisions are published in the Federal Register. A final order was issued against CVS, which ultimately paid a $22 million fine. In 2012, Cardinal also reached a settlement. A company spokesman recently told The Post that Cardinal uses state-of-the-art techniques, including advanced analytics, to combat diversion. To date, the company has not been fined. A federal prosecutor and company officials said negotiations are continuing. *** In December 2012, a new lawyer filled the position in charge of approving cases brought by the DEA\u2019s diversion office. A career employee of the Justice Department, Clifford Reeves had worked on the case against CVS. At first, diversion investigators were encouraged by the arrival of an experienced lawyer. But soon, complaints arose in some of the DEA\u2019s field offices around the country. Under Reeves, DEA attorneys began demanding additional evidence before investigators could take action. \u201cAfter Reeves arrived, everything became confrontational,\u201d Geldhof, the retired DEA diversion manager in Detroit, recalled in a recent interview. \u201cThere were a lot of roadblocks all the time. Everything was an issue.\u201d Before Reeves\u2019s arrival, Geldhof said, investigators had to demonstrate that they had amassed \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d before moving forward with enforcement cases, which are administrative, not criminal. Under Reeves, Geldhof said, investigators had to establish that their evidence was \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d a much higher standard used in criminal \u00adcases. Geldhof said he repeatedly confronted Reeves about the languishing cases. \u201cI said, \u2018Lee, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201d Geldhof said. He said Reeves simply told him about the new higher standard. Barbara Heath, a DEA program manager in Atlanta, said she and her investigators were frustrated by the new policy in Washington. \u201cIt was the most significant change in my 20 years at the DEA,\u201d said Heath, who oversaw the agency\u2019s diversion efforts in Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee from 2006 until her retirement in December. \u201cIt got to the point where they wanted the same evidence as criminal prosecutions. It was very difficult to prove intent.\u201d In Washington, Mulrooney, the chief DEA judge, was documenting the falling caseload. In a June 24, 2013, quarterly report, Mulrooney wrote that there was \u201ca significant drop\u201d in the number of \u201corders to show cause.\u201d Four months later, he noted \u201ca free fall in the numbers of charging documents.\u201d For the first time since records had been kept, he noted, no charging documents had been filed for an entire month. Younker, the retired DEA supervisor in Cincinnati, said he, too, called Reeves to complain. \u201cLook, these cases are lingering here, they\u2019re down in your shop for six to 12 months,\u201d Younker recalled telling Reeves. \u201cThey\u2019re sending drugs out and people are dying, and this is like the emperor has no clothes on.\u201d Younker said Reeves replied: \u201cWho\u2019s the emperor?\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019re the emperor. You can\u2019t sit on these things like this.\u2019 \u201d Seeing what was happening in the field, Rannazzisi said he became furious with Reeves. \u201cAt one point, I said: \u2018I\u2019ve lost all faith in the counsel, and you\u2019ve become a hindrance and not a help, and all these people are dying,\u2019 \u201d Rannazzisi said. Chaney, the former DEA supervisor in Columbus, said her office in 2011 began investigating an Ohio distributor that sent tens of millions of pain pills to doctors and pharmacies in Florida over three to four years. Chaney said there was no reason to ship that many pills to Florida from Ohio, because the company already had a distribution facility in Florida. The DEA also had previously taken action against some of the doctors who were writing prescriptions for opioids filled by the Florida pharmacies. \u201cIt was a righteous case,\u201d she said. But the lawyers at DEA headquarters disagreed. The original DEA attorney assigned to the case was removed and replaced by a lawyer who stalled the case at every turn, Chaney said. \u201cIt was never enough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never satisfy them.\u201d Chaney declined to identify the company because no legal action was taken. At the end of 2013, she retired from the DEA. \u201cWe were all very dedicated, and we were all deeply disappointed that the program was being manipulated this way,\u201d she said. Chaney said she had joined the DEA because of a personal loss: Her mother became addicted to Percocet after a car accident and died of an accidental overdose. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason I got into this work,\u201d she said. \u201cTo see this happening, it makes me want to cry.\u201d In Washington, Mulrooney was becoming increasingly frustrated, his quarterly reports show. In a June 24, 2014, report, the judge wrote that the DEA\u2019s legal office had filed only seven show-cause orders and one immediate suspension order in the previous three months. \u201cThese numbers continue to reflect an alarmingly low rate of Agency Diversion enforcement activity on a national level relative to historical data,\u201d Mulrooney wrote. He noted that the drop in cases coincided with \u201ca leadership transition\u201d in the legal office. He wrote that he couldn\u2019t determine who was to blame \u2014 the field offices or the lawyers at headquarters. Mulrooney divided the operating budget of the diversion office by the number of cases that were being approved. He found that each case was costing taxpayers nearly $11 million. \u201cAssuming also that opioid- related deaths remain at over 20,000 per year (2010-2011 levels), this would mean that the Agency is on course to institute one administrative enforcement action for every 625 fatalities,\u201d he wrote. Three months later, Mulrooney reported that the diversion caseload was so low, his judges had little to do. He began permitting them to hear cases from other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Prisons and the Treasury Department. In the summer of 2014, Rannazzisi said that he received an unusual request. To foster better relations with industry, the Justice Department wanted to meet with senior representatives of drug distributors and pharmacy chains. Rannazzisi said he was appalled. Some of the companies were either under investigation or in the midst of settlement negotiations with the DEA diversion office, he said. But Rannazzisi said that he objected and that the meeting did not take place. *** That summer, lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry intensified on Capitol Hill. Several members of Congress, led by Reps. Tom Marino (R-Pa.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), were proposing a measure that critics said would undercut the DEA\u2019s ability to hold drug distributors accountable. Four major players lobbied heavily in favor of the legislation, called the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. Together, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and the distributors\u2019 association, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, spent $13 million lobbying House and Senate members and their staffs on the legislation and other issues between 2014 and 2016, according a Post analysis of lobbying records. In July 2014, Rannazzisi was asked to explain his opposition to the bill in a conference call with congressional staffers. \u201cI said, \u2018This bill passes the way it\u2019s written we won\u2019t be able to get immediate suspension orders, we won\u2019t be able to stop the hemorrhaging of these drugs out of these bad pharmacies and these bad corporations,\u2019 \u201d Rannazzisi recalled telling them. \u201c \u2018What you\u2019re doing is filing a bill that will protect defendants in our cases.\u2019 \u201d His remarks enraged Marino, the chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on regulatory reform. In a Sept. 18, 2014, congressional hearing, Marino tore into then-DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart, Rannazzisi\u2019s boss. By then, the legislation had passed the House; the bill was about to be introduced in the Senate. \u201cIt is my understanding that Joe Rannazzisi, a senior DEA official, has publicly accused we sponsors of the bill of, quote, \u2018supporting criminals,\u2019 unquote,\u201d Marino said. \u201cThis offends me immensely.\u201d Marino told Leonhart that Congress was sending the DEA a message: \u201cYou should take a serious look at your regulatory culture and seek collaboration with legitimate companies that want to do the right thing.\u201d Marino mentioned Holder\u2019s desire to meet with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. At a hearing, Marino said he was \u201cdisappointed that DOJ staff has not made this a priority.\u201d Seven days later, Marino and Blackburn, who represent districts in states that have been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, demanded that the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general investigate Rannazzisi\u2019s remarks. They said he had tried to \u201cintimidate\u201d members of Congress. An investigation was launched. Rannazzisi was replaced in August 2015 and retired last October. \u201cThat led to his undoing,\u201d said Matthew Murphy, a DEA official who worked with Rannazzisi in the diversion office. Rannazzisi had \u201cvery, very strong views\u201d on what was happening on the street, Murphy said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t going to change his opinion because of some heat.\u201d Marino said the conflict boils down to one person \u2014 Rannazzisi. \u201cOne longstanding Congressional criticism of DEA\u2019s diversion control division has been a lack of communication with its registrants,\u201d Carr, the Justice Department spokesman, said in the recent statement. \u201cUpon his arrival at DEA in May 2015, in response to these concerns, Acting Administrator Rosenberg made it a priority to improve communication with registrants and strengthen partnerships with the regulated industry.\u201d John M. Gray, president and chief executive of the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, the wholesalers\u2019 trade association, praised the new approach. \u201cHDA is pleased with the willingness of the new leadership at the DEA to meet with and engage registrants, and is encouraged by the Administration\u2019s desire to \u2018reset the relationship\u2019 with our industry,\u2019 \u201d Gray said in a recent statement to The Post. Rannazzisi said he views the new relationship as a surrender to industry. \u201cThis idea that they\u2019re going to say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I violated the law, give me another chance and I\u2019ll make it right,\u2019 without having some type of punishment, to me is outrageous,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I talked to a parent who lost a kid, I\u2019m pretty sure they didn\u2019t want me to say, \u2018Oh, give them another chance because corporate America needs another chance.\u2019 \u201d **Unnatural causes: Sick and dying in small-town America** This story is part of a series exploring the rise in death rates among middle- aged white women and the forces driving it. Read previous stories from this series here.", "Title: U.S. senator calls for investigation of DEA enforcement slowdown amid opioid crisis Content: A U.S. senator on Monday called for an investigation into why the Drug Enforcement Administration slowed enforcement efforts against pharmaceutical companies accused of violating laws designed to prevent pain pills from reaching the black market. Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in a letter asked the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general to investigate. She said she had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about reports of an enforcement slowdown as the opioid epidemic escalated nationwide. \u201cThis a matter of life and death and I want to know whether or not we could have done more,\u201d McCaskill said in a statement. A spokesman for Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz declined to comment. A DEA spokesman said the agency would review the senator\u2019s request. McCaskill cited recent reports by The Washington Post that the agency had delayed and blocked enforcement efforts against several large opioid distributors and required field investigators to meet a higher burden of proof before they could take action. Five former supervisors from the DEA\u2019s Diversion Control Division, which regulates the pharmaceutical industry, told The Post in on-the-record interviews that they had become frustrated by the slowdown as overdose deaths soared, particularly in the nation\u2019s rural communities. Their concerns were documented by the DEA\u2019s chief administrative law judge, who said in his quarterly reports to agency supervisors that the number of enforcement actions being approved at headquarters was \u201cstunningly low for a national program.\u201d The Post also reported that enforcement efforts had been questioned by high-ranking Justice Department officials and that key architects of the DEA\u2019s campaign against opioid distributors had been hired away by the pharmaceutical industry. McCaskill noted that 183,000 people have died from overdoses of prescription narcotics between 1999 and 2015, with more than 15,000 in 2015 alone. She said her home state ranked first among Midwestern states in the number of prescription painkillers being sold. The senator said that the DEA had reached financial settlements in several cases\u00ad against the nation\u2019s largest distributors of narcotic painkillers. But she questioned whether those penalties were sufficient to curb the continuing epidemic and hold the companies accountable. The DEA\u2019s efforts have been \u201ctoo little, too late,\u201d she said in the letter requesting the investigation. In October, nine other U.S. senators demanded that the DEA explain why it has slowed enforcement efforts against the pharmaceutical industry. In letters to the agency, those senators said their questions have been \u201cignored\u201d by the agency or that the answers they received \u201cwere totally inadequate.\u201d", "Title: This company\u2019s drugs helped fuel Florida\u2019s opioid crisis. But the government struggled to hold it accountable. Content: To combat an escalating opioid epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration trained its sights in 2011 on Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers of the highly addictive generic painkiller oxycodone. It was the first time the DEA had targeted a manufacturer of opioids for alleged violations of laws designed to prevent diversion of legal narcotics to the black market. And it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued. Ultimately, the DEA and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. Government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company\u2019s lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by The Washington Post. But six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against Mallinckrodt. Instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Under the proposal, which remains confidential, Mallinckrodt would agree to pay a $35 million fine and admit no wrongdoing. \u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s response was that \u00ad\u2018everyone knew what was going on in Florida but they had no duty to report it,\u2019 \u201d according to an internal summary of the case prepared by federal prosecutors and obtained by The Post. The case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product. DEA investigators appalled by rising overdose deaths said they worked for years to build the biggest case of their careers only to watch it falter on uncertain legal territory and in the face of stiff resistance from the company. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t taking this seriously, and people were dying,\u201d said a former law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. \u201cPeople were dying all over the place. It wasn\u2019t their kids, their wives, their husbands, their brothers. It was some hillbilly in Central Florida, so who cares?\u201d In a statement, a Mallinckrodt spokesman said the company has worked hard to fight drug diversion. \u201cMallinckrodt has long been a recognized leader in developing and sharing best practices related to the prevention of opioid diversion and misuse, and has continuously invested significant resources to address this serious drug epidemic,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are proud of the programs and initiatives we\u2019ve developed to ensure appropriate use of pain medication and, most importantly, to deter such medications from ending up in the wrong hands.\u201d Officials at the DEA declined to comment for this article. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. \u201cOur office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions,\u201d acting U.S. attorney Daniel Lemisch said. \u201cThis is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. As this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.\u201d Under federal law and DEA policy, pharmaceutical companies such as Mallinckrodt are required to \u201cknow their customers\u201d and monitor the pattern, frequency and amounts of drug orders. When suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their DEA licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties. According to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, Mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. But the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. Mallinckrodt contended that the DEA has never required manufacturers to know their customers\u2019 customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law. \u201cMallinckrodt took unprecedented steps beyond the legal obligations of a manufacturer. Mallinckrodt began monitoring downstream sales between wholesalers and pharmacies, and proactively informed both its customers and the DEA of its findings,\u201d said Brien T. O\u2019Connor, a lawyer for the company. \u201cThe company continues to enhance its anti-diversion programs to this day.\u201d The proposed $35 million settlement comes as the nation\u2019s prescription opioid epidemic continues to worsen, with nearly 180,000 lives lost to overdoses since 2000. The Post reported in October that the DEA\u2019s civil and administrative enforcement efforts against the mammoth wholesale distributors that deliver painkillers to pharmacies stalled in the face of a stepped-up lobbying campaign by the drug industry. The Mallinckrodt case was something different: an aggressive attempt to hold a drug manufacturer accountable. Mallinckrodt was founded 150 years ago in St. Louis and became the leading supplier of chemicals for the emerging photography industry. Now based in the United Kingdom after corporate acquisitions, Mallinckrodt is one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers of oxycodone, a powerful opioid made from the natural painkiller found in poppies. \u201cWhen you get to the manufacturing level, it\u2019s hard to prove that they knew what was happening,\u201d another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. \u201cBut they were making the product, they were selling it to the country\u2019s largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. These orders were beyond suspicious.\u201d The first hint that Mallinckrodt might pose a problem for the DEA came not from Florida but from Tennessee. On July 7, 2009, members of a Tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of \u00adMallinckrodt-made oxycodone. Task force agents alerted Mallinckrodt. The company\u2019s lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills. Three days later, Mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by Barry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla. The company said that one of its distributors, Sunrise Wholesale of Broward County, Fla., had sent 20,400 tablets of oxycodone to Schultz in the previous year. The Florida Department of Health had just issued an administrative complaint against Schultz for prescribing oxycodone outside \u201cthe course of his professional practice.\u201d His medical office had become a thoroughfare for those seeking easy access to drugs, records show. On July 27, a Mallinckrodt security director told DEA Supervisor Paul \u201cPete\u201d Kleissle in St. Louis about the Tennessee connection. Kleissle recommended that Mallinckrodt conduct an audit of Sunrise and the company agreed, government documents show. The investigation seemed to stall there, but the events in Tennessee would later prove significant. At the time, the DEA\u2019s Diversion Control Division was ramping up enforcement efforts against the nation\u2019s wholesale drug distributors \u2014 including Sunrise \u2014 warning them and drug manufacturers that they would be held accountable if they failed to report suspicious orders. Under the DEA\u2019s \u201cdistributor initiative,\u201d the agency had begun to make cases against large and small wholesalers. In 2010 and 2011, DEA investigators in several states started to see large amounts of Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone being sent to Florida. By then, Mallinckrodt\u2019s blue \u00ad30-milligram oxycodone tablets had become so popular among drug users and dealers that they had a street name \u2014 \u201cM\u2019s,\u201d for the company\u2019s distinctive block-letter logo. Florida\u2019s lax laws, dishonest doctors and unscrupulous pharmacists had turned the state into ground zero for the nation\u2019s prescription opioid crisis. One distributor that caught the attention of the DEA for sending drugs to Florida was KeySource Medical, a regional company based in Cincinnati. In 2010, it sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida, documents show. That was nearly 2.5 pills for every man, woman and child in the state. The DEA accused KeySource in June 2011 of trying to conceal the amounts of drugs it was shipping by splitting its orders and told the company to halt its oxycodone shipments. Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone cropped up again when the DEA looked at one of the nation\u2019s three largest drug distributors, Cardinal Health, which was sending vast quantities to four pharmacies in Florida. The DEA had seen enough. On Aug. 23, 2011, DEA supervisors met with Mallinckrodt executives at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Arlington, Va., the day a rare 5.8-magnitude earthquake hit the Washington region. People involved in the case still call the gathering \u201cthe earthquake meeting.\u201d DEA officials showed the company the remarkable amounts of its oxycodone going to distributors and the number of arrests being made for oxycodone possession and distribution on the street, according to one participant in the meeting who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. \u201cThere were a lot of follow-ups, and they said they would adjust their practices,\u201d the participant said. The next day, the DEA\u2019s chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency\u2019s investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Leslie Wizner, an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit. \u201cI think we can all agree that yesterday\u2019s meeting was an eye opener for the company, and very successful, on so many levels, from DEA\u2019s perspective,\u201d Barbara J. Boockholdt wrote in an email obtained by The Post. She noted that there were \u201cpending and proposed investigations\u201d of Mallinckrodt. Boockholdt declined to comment. Wizner did not return calls requesting an interview. Three weeks after the Aug. 23 meeting, Mallinckrodt notified 43 of its distributors that they would no longer receive rebates from the company if they continued to supply certain pharmacies whose orders appeared to be suspicious. But by then, the DEA and federal prosecutors had decided to take the investigation of the company to another level. On Nov. 30, 2011, the DEA served a subpoena on Mallinckrodt, demanding documents related to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, according to the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subpoena brought a windfall of information. The DEA gained access to data from Mallinckrodt\u2019s rebate or \u201cchargeback\u201d program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. That information and other records showed where Mallinckrodt\u2019s oxycodone was going \u2014 from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain. The significance of the Tennessee case started to become clear. The DEA learned that in the six weeks after the Tennessee task force alerted Mallinckrodt to the drugs found in the 2009 sting operation, the company had shipped another 2.1 million tablets of oxycodone to Sunrise, the Florida distributor. The DEA also discovered that Sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to Schultz, the Delray Beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in Tennessee. In one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient. At the time, the street value of oxycodone was $30 a tablet. The Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street, prosecutors said. Prosecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. Under pressure from the DEA, Sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office had arrested Schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. Schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. \u201cMallinckrodt knew through law enforcement reports that Barry Schultz was diverting controlled substances, and that the diverted oxycodone was supplied by Mallinckrodt through Sunrise,\u201d prosecutors later wrote in an internal document sent to the company. \u201cWhen Mallinckrodt continued to distribute oxycodone to Sunrise for such purposes, and continued to pay incentives in the form of chargebacks for the product sales to Barry Schultz, Mallinckrodt was diverting oxycodone.\u201d In Oct. 22, 2012, the DEA served Mallinckrodt with another subpoena for records relating to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, the company disclosed in SEC filings. Those filings also showed that the DEA was examining Mallinckrodt\u2019s plant in Hobart, N.Y., about 70 miles southwest of Albany. Investigators documented scores of alleged violations, including the failure to secure narcotics, to keep accurate records or to document transfers of drugs, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Post. In 2014, Mallinckrodt, which is publicly traded and maintains its U.S. headquarters in St. Louis, notified its shareholders that it was under investigation by the federal government and had received subpoenas for documents. But with no sign of civil action by the DEA, the company said it believed that \u201cthe ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\u201d In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit. Behind the scenes, however, the case against Mallinckrodt was growing more serious. Prosecutors said in internal documents that they found the company\u2019s behavior so egregious that they initially considered framing it as a civil conspiracy. \u201cMallinckrodt did knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with Sunrise and Barry Schultz to commit offenses against the United States,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a draft complaint against the company that was never filed. \u201cThat is, to knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully distribute, dispense or prescribe controlled substances, including but not limited to the Schedule II drug oxycodone 30 mg.\u201d O\u2019Connor, the Mallinckrodt lawyer, said that the draft document reflects \u201cdiscredited allegations made in the heat of negotiations in 2015\u201d and that the government and the company moved past those accusations. \u201cIn particular, it is wrong to suggest Mallinckrodt was involved in any conspiracy related to Dr. Barry Schultz and Sunrise Wholesale,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIn reality, Mallinckrodt worked with law enforcement to investigate potential diversion by the physician and to audit Sunrise, and, importantly, the DEA praised the company\u2019s handling of the investigation.\u201d Prosecutors weighed the strengths and weaknesses of their case in an internal summary they prepared Aug. 7, 2014. \u201cWe will argue that thousands of orders from the distributors as well as tens of thousands of orders from these down-stream customers were suspicious because of the pattern of distribution to Florida,\u201d prosecutors wrote. In all, they said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious \u2014 orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA. Prosecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. They noted that the DEA had provided conflicting guidance to Mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as Schultz. For example, Kleissle, the DEA supervisor in St. Louis, had told the company in 2010 after the Tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor\u2019s customers, the pharmacies and doctors. But that same year, a DEA investigator in New York, Heather White, told \u00adMallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about \u201cknow your customer\u2019s customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement,\u201d according to the prosecutor\u2019s summary. White declined to comment for this article. Mallinckrodt pushed back against the government\u2019s contention that it was responsible for the acts of downstream retail customers such as Schultz. The company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. Mal\u00adlinckrodt also said that the DEA was aware of the company\u2019s increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. The DEA sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. The company also complained that the DEA has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders. \u201cMallinckrodt has agreed to pay a settlement amount relating to orders from its distributors,\u201d prosecutors wrote in the summary. \u201cHowever, it refuses to negotiate any settlement relating to the downstream customers orders.\u201d The company put together a \u00adhigh-powered legal team to fight on its behalf. It included O\u2019Connor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud and corruption cases, and D. Linden Barber, a former associate chief counsel for the DEA\u2019s diversion division who was one of the architects of the agency\u2019s crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry. Following negotiations between Mallinckrodt\u2019s legal team and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. The negotiations then focused on the relationship between Mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to Florida. Prosecutors noted that the DEA had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. They also said Mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as Florida. \u201cWith respect to distributor orders,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a document, \u00ad\u201cMallinckrodt\u2019s obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.\u201d On July 10, 2015, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office sent a proposed settlement offer to lawyers for Mallinckrodt. Prosecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to Florida were \u201cexcessive\u201d and should have been reported as suspicious. Or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 Mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in Florida in 2009 and 2010. \u201cAs you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their offer. But the big buildup resulted in a much smaller proposed fine. Despite the billion-dollar figures bandied about, the prosecutors proposed settling the case for $70 million. They cited the \u201clitigation risk\u201d they faced if the case went to trial, Mallinckrodt\u2019s previous legal arguments and the size of other recent settlements with drug distributors. This year, on Feb. 7, Mallinckrodt told its shareholders in an SEC filing that the investigation \u201cwill not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition\u201d because it has set aside the money. Sources close to the negotiations said that the two sides had recently reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $35 million. With final approval pending from the Justice Department, some of those who worked on the case said they are deeply disappointed by the dollar amount of the proposed fine. Drug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. Glaxo\u00adSmithKline was fined $3 billion, and Pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. Purdue Pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation\u2019s opioid crisis: OxyContin. All of those cases were initiated by the Food and Drug Administration. The largest fine the DEA has levied against a drug distributor was the $150 million that McKesson, the nation\u2019s largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers. For a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is \u201cchump change,\u201d one government official said. \u201cThe problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before,\u201d said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. \u201cThere was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. Is it ideal? No. Is this a number that everyone wants to see? No. People would probably like to see more. But this is about more than money. It\u2019s about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.\u201d", "Title: Drugmakers and distributors face barrage of lawsuits over opioid epidemic Content: The companies that manufacture and distribute highly addictive painkillers are facing a barrage of lawsuits for the toll their product has taken on communities across the country as the worst drug epidemic in U.S. history continues to escalate. Within the past year, at least 25 states, cities and counties have filed civil cases against manufacturers, distributors and large drugstore chains that make up the $13 billion-a-year opioid industry. In the past few weeks alone, the attorneys general for Ohio and Missouri, along with the district attorneys for three counties in Tennessee, filed suits against the industry \u2014 and the attorney general for Oklahoma filed suit on Friday. The strategy echoes the effort against major tobacco companies in the 1990s and is born of similar frustration over rising death rates and the increasing costs of addressing the continuing public health crisis. After years of government and pharmaceutical firms failing to control the problem, some lawyers say the suits have the potential to force the industry to curb practices that contribute to it. \u201cIf they\u2019re not going to do it voluntarily, we\u2019re going to drag them to the table and make them,\u201d said Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who sued five drug manufacturers for the costs of the opioid epidemic. Dozens of other state, county and city governments and local law enforcement agencies are considering legal action. Some states are interviewing law firms. Delaware is among a handful of states that are even issuing \u201crequests for proposals\u201d from law firms. In addition, more than half the country\u2019s state attorneys general \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 have banded together to investigate the industry. Two congressional panels also are examining the industry \u2014 the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general is investigating why the Drug Enforcement Administration slowed enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies. Representatives of the companies deny wrongdoing and vow to vigorously defend themselves. They said they have taken steps to prevent the diversion of their drugs to the black market. Stemming the epidemic, they said, will take a coordinated effort by doctors, the industry, and federal and local government agencies. \u201cAs we look to prevent abuse and misuse in the future, it will require a forward-looking, systemic approach that calls on greater coordination and collaboration between health-care, law enforcement, and state and federal regulatory authorities,\u201d said the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, which represents companies that distribute drugs. But in a blow to the industry, the D.C. Court of Appeals on Friday rejected arguments from a drug distributor, Masters Pharmaceutical, that would have undermined the DEA\u2019s ability to hold companies responsible for pain pills that are diverted to the black market. The lawsuits come as states and communities grapple with the economic impact of a prescription drug epidemic that has resulted in nearly 180,000 overdose deaths between 2000 and 2015 \u2014 more than three times the number of Americans who died during the Vietnam War. The epidemic has led to thousands more deaths from overdoses of heroin and fentanyl, which are becoming easier and cheaper to obtain than prescription drugs. But winning the lawsuits will not be easy, according to Richard C. Ausness, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who studies product liability litigation. He said it is more likely that the companies will settle rather than try to defend themselves against dozens, perhaps hundreds, of lawsuits. \u201cI think what\u2019s going on, and this is what happened in the tobacco litigation, is that the plaintiffs never actually won a case,\u201d Ausness said. \u201cWhat they did is they drove up the cost of litigation so much that the defendants finally settled.\u201d Manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains are expected to argue that they cannot be held responsible for what happens to pain pills once they travel down the supply chain. \u201cThey ship a drug that\u2019s approved by the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], and then a bunch of bad actors intervene \u2014 pill mills, doctors who overprescribe and the addicts themselves,\u201d Ausness said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty strong argument.\u201d The suits are reminiscent of the tobacco cases filed two decades ago. In the 1990s, 46 attorneys general eventually combined their resources to sue the tobacco companies. In 1998, the industry settled those suits, agreeing to pay more than $200 billion. \u201cThese pharmaceutical companies should be scared as hell,\u201d said Richard Fields, an attorney who has filed suit on behalf of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. The suit alleges that the nation\u2019s top six drug distributors and pharmacy chains flooded the state with hundreds of millions of pain pills, decimating the Cherokee Nation\u2019s 14 counties. During a meeting of the Democratic Attorneys General Association in May in Portland, Ore., industry officials said they were not to blame for the epidemic. Instead, they said during a panel discussion that they were part of the solution and had put programs in place to prevent the illegal use of pain pills. Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general who was the first Republican to sue the tobacco companies, said he was appalled by what he heard. As the officials finished their presentations, Woods stood from his seat in the crowded sixth-floor ballroom of The Nines resort hotel and told them they all deserved to be sued. Woods has joined forces with another veteran of the tobacco lawsuits, Mike Moore, who served as the attorney general for Mississippi and filed the first of the tobacco suits. The two attorneys, along with other high-profile lawyers, are now working for Ohio and Mississippi on their opioid cases, and they are signing up other states to sue the companies. Woods said the similarities between the opioid and tobacco suits are striking. \u201cThey are big companies that knew their product was doing harm,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of helping to solve the problem, they promoted the irresponsible use of their product to improve their bottom line.\u201d At the same time, prescription narcotics, when used appropriately, can eliminate pain without deadly health consequences \u2014 a claim cigarette manufacturers could not make. The suits target some of the biggest names in the business, including McKesson, Johnson & Johnson and CVS. Some of the suits allege that the companies fraudulently marketed opioids to the public. Others claim that the companies failed to report suspiciously large orders of prescription pain pills placed by distributors and pharmacies. McKesson, the largest drug distribution company in the country, said in a statement: \u201cWhile McKesson doesn\u2019t manufacture, prescribe, or dispense opioids, we have taken steps to play a leadership role in combatting this epidemic in close partnership with doctors, pharmacists, the DEA and other organizations across the supply chain.\u201d Johnson & Johnson\u2019s pharmaceutical unit, Janssen Pharmaceutical, issued a statement saying the company is \u201ccontinuing to work with stakeholders to support\u201d the \u201csafe and appropriate use\u201d of opioids. CVS said it has \u201cstringent\u201d procedures to keep prescription pain pills out of the hands of drug addicts and dealers. \u201cCVS Health is committed to the highest standards of ethics and business practices, including complying with all federal and state laws governing the dispensing of controlled substance prescriptions, and is dedicated to reducing prescription drug abuse and diversion,\u201d the company said in a statement. As the epidemic spreads, more states are declaring states of emergency and filing lawsuits. In New York, eight counties have filed suits. Salvatore Badala, who filed a suit on behalf of Nassau County on June 12, said his client needs financial help. \u201cIt\u2019s getting worse every day,\u201d he said. In Missouri, Attorney General Josh Hawley filed suit June 22 against three manufacturers of opioids. In 2015, 500 people died from opioid-related overdoses, not counting heroin, and there were 30,000 opioid-related emergency room visits that same year, a 200 percent increase over the previous decade. In West Virginia, seven counties filed suit in March. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous,\u201d said Paul Farrell Jr., who filed the suits. He and other attorneys say they expect industry lawyers to delay the cases. \u201cThey can drag it on for a very long time,\u201d said J. Gerard Stranch IV, a lawyer who is part of the Tennessee suit. \u201cBut there will come a day when they have to stand up in front of a jury and explain themselves. And that day of reckoning is coming.\u201d"], "reason": {"ranked_passages": [{"identifier": 3, "direct_reason": "This passage directly mentions a U.S. senator calling for an investigation into the DEA's enforcement slowdown amid the opioid crisis.

Camping along the Inca Trail, he found himself with the usual traveler\u2019s symptoms, scrambling for the latrine in the middle of the night. He took antibiotics for five days and got better but then relapsed. A second five-day course of the drugs finally knocked out the infection. After he returned home, Knight resumed his normal diet and exercise activities, and suddenly began dropping pounds that he had been trying to shed for years. He is convinced the antibiotics changed the composition of the microbes in his gut in a way that finally caused him to lose weight \u2014 at least 70 pounds. \u201cExercise and diet, which had not worked before, began to work,\u201d says Knight, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies the microorganisms that live in our bodies, known as the human microbiome. \u201cI think that reconfiguring my gut microbial community made it possible.\u201d His experience underscores a growing body of evidence suggesting that naturally occurring bacteria and other microbes in the body, and possibly even viruses, can influence weight in ways that scientists are only just beginning to understand. Numerous studies are underway looking at the role of intestinal organisms in obesity, with a focus on how they extract energy from food and how this affects weight gain or loss. Ultimately, scientists say, insights gained from the research could identify people predisposed to obesity and possibly help clinicians create targeted weight-loss treatments for them. The specific composition of microbes in the intestines also might help predict the best candidates for weight-loss surgery, which doesn\u2019t work for everyone. \u201cTaken together, we might at some point be able to effect weight loss in humans by affecting the microbiome,\u2019\u2019 Knight says. Obesity in the United States has risen dramatically during the past 20 years. More than a third of American adults and about 17 percent of children and adolescents \u2014 triple the rate of a generation ago \u2014 are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. surgeon general estimates that as many as 300,000 Americans deaths every year may be linked to obesity. Despite the popularity of fad diets, most experts believe there is no quick fix to losing weight. They view regulation of body weight as a complicated process that is likely to involve diet and exercise, genetics and, probably, various gastrointestinal microbes. Studies in mice have shown that intestinal microbes may contribute to weight gain. A novel experiment published this fall, for example, took gut bacteria from human twins \u2014 in which one was lean and the other obese \u2014 and transferred them into lean mice. The animals with bacteria from fat twins grew fat; those that received bacteria from lean twins stayed lean. Researchers suspect that bacteria may behave similarly among humans, since microbes help to extract calories from food and store that potential energy in fat tissue. Researchers speculate that people are more likely to gain weight when gut bacteria are more efficient at breaking down food, enabling the body to absorb more calories. They theorize that less-efficient bacteria allow food to pass more quickly through the intestines. \u201cIf you want to stay lean, you\u2019ll want bacteria that are not very efficient,\u2019\u2019 says Claire Fraser, a professor of medicine and microbiology and immunology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. \u201cIf we each eat a bowl of cereal and your bacteria are better than mine at breaking it down, you\u2019ll get 95 calories, while I\u2019ll only get 70, and the rest will pass through. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to gain weight.\u2019\u2019 The food one eats contributes to the composition of the bacterial communities in the gut. For example, Fraser says, \u201chigh-fat, low-fiber diets have been associated with different bacteria in the gut than low-fat, high-fiber diets,\u201d which may play a role in who develops obesity. \u201cIt may be a vicious cycle but one we can interrupt by altering our dietary habits.\u2019\u2019 Recent studies by Stanley Hazen of the Cleveland Clinic, for example, have found that gastrointestinal bacteria \u201cburp\u201d out a chemical called TMAO (for trimethylamine N-oxide) after people consume red meat or eggs. TMAO increases the risk of heart attack and stroke, which may help explain why eating those foods increases the danger of heart disease more than following a vegan or vegetarian diet. In another study, Fraser, Knight and colleagues studied members of the Old Order Amish in Lancaster, Pa., to see what their gut microbes might reveal about obesity in that community. The Amish were ideal study subjects, being a genetically homogenous society with a shared lifestyle, including a diet that features \u201clots of meat, potatoes and gravy, very high fat and high carbohydrate,\u2019\u2019 Fraser says. The researchers analyzed data from 310 people and identified 26 species of gut bacteria that were found at different concentrations in obese individuals who had \u2014 or didn\u2019t have \u2014 metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that includes hypertension, high blood-sugar levels, abnormal cholesterol, excess body fat around the waist and elevated serum markers associated with inflammation. The syndrome has been found to increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. One of the hallmarks of metabolic syndrome is chronic low-grade inflammation in the body, and \u201csome of the bacterial species that were found at greatly reduced levels in subjects with the metabolic syndrome have been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties,\u2019\u2019 Fraser says. Knight points out, however, that the difference in microbial communities might be the result of inflammation rather than the cause of it, a question additional studies will need to examine. Scientists also are trying to understand the influence of gut microbes in the outcome of weight-loss surgery, with the goal of identifying the best candidates for the procedure. In 2010, about 150,000 individuals underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. Bruce Rittmann, director of the Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology in the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, was part of a group of researchers who specifically looked at microbes in gastric bypass surgery patients for a 2009 study. He and team leader Rosa Krajmalnik-Brown, associate professor in the Swette Center, analyzed stool samples from nine people in three groups: three individuals of normal weight, three who were morbidly obese and three who had undergone gastric bypass. \u201cThe results were very striking,\u201d Rittmann says. \u201cEven though we didn\u2019t have a large number of subjects, the groups were completely different from each other.\u2019\u2019 The composition of microbes in the three gastric bypass patients differed substantially and in potentially important ways from obese and normal-weight individuals, suggesting that the extreme anatomical changes resulting from the surgery apparently had profound effects on the microorganisms living in the intestine. There were two types of organisms specific to the obese group. The microbial populations extracted from obese individuals were high in hydrogen-producing bacteria, known as Prevotellaceae, and hydrogen-consuming methanogens, which are not bacteria, but another single-cell organism, Archaea. The results suggest a cooperative co-existence in obese individuals between hydrogen producers and hydrogen consumers, a mutually reinforcing relationship known as syntrophy that contributes to obesity. The researchers theorize that the methanogens, by removing hydrogen, speed up the breakdown of food, boosting the production of fatty acids and leading to the formation of fat, which, over time, results in obesity. Rittmann and his colleagues have another study underway, this time examining people before and after weight-loss surgery and comparing the types of weight-loss procedures, trying to determine which microbic changes occur and what they might mean. \u201cManaging the microbial community in our intestines is one of the tools of helping us manage obesity and other diseases,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable that someday we could get rid of the wrong microorganisms and put the right ones in. That is, ultimately, what we would like to do.\u2019\u2019 Knight, however, warns that people should not assume that a course of antibiotics might make them thin, as he believes it did in his case. In fact, he says, it\u2019s just possible that the opposite could occur. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to generalize one person\u2019s experience to the general population, especially because different people vary so much in their response to drugs, diet and exercise,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cWe are a long way from turning that into a large-scale study. All we have at the moment is an intriguing anecdote, based on a sample size of one.\u201d", "Title: I tried a cleanse to lose weight and feel better. All I felt was much worse. Content: I remember my first cleanse vividly. After months of gorging on French bread, brie, potato chips and more beer than I care to admit, my pants no longer fit. Even my spandex felt tight \u2014 a testament to my willingness to consume anything and everything while studying abroad. That\u2019s when I knew it was time for a change. And I wanted a quick fix. One simple search on the Internet for \u201close weight NOW\u201d led me to a 10-day liquid diet consisting only of \u201clemonade.\u201d Apparently Beyonc\u00e9 drank the Kool- Aid (err, lemonade) and lost 20 pounds. It\u2019s perfect, I thought. My roommate agreed, and we decided to embark on our first cleansing journey together. Hours later, we were back in our flat with countless lemons, a huge tub of Grade B maple syrup, cayenne, several jugs of purified water and a bottle of sea salt (for what I fondly started to call the salt water flush from hell). Game on. The first glass was fine: The spicy-sweet mixture was oddly satisfying. The prospect of dropping 20 pounds in 10 days probably helped make it taste even sweeter. A full day of cleansing came and went. It wasn\u2019t bad, but it wasn\u2019t what I was hoping for, either. I didn\u2019t feel tortured or skinnier. Day 2, I was miserable. I had no energy. I felt as though I was suffering from a rare disorder in which a parasite eats at you, and my patience level was at an all-time low. After walking two miles to work, I thought I was going to collapse. On top of my lack of physical stamina, I had close to zero brainpower. Staring at my blank computer screen felt as strenuous as running a marathon in a snowstorm; hilarious e-mail chats were the most annoying things I\u2019d ever read; I hated everyone; I hated the cleanse; I hadn\u2019t lost weight. By Day 4, my friends abandoned me, my spandex still felt as though it was going to burst at the seams and the sight of anything edible made me hallucinate. Then I found evidence of sandwich consumption under my roommate\u2019s bed. She had been cheating. And she wasn\u2019t ashamed. \u201cYou\u2019re insane and this is stupid,\u201d she said. She had a point. An hour later, we were in a bar, beers in hand and burgers in our mouths. Life was good again. I tried that cleanse again three more times and followed the rules more closely: The first go-round, I\u2019d skipped prep, didn\u2019t listen to my body when it was tired, gave up after four days and skipped the phase-out process, too. But the results were the same: I was hungry, irritable, weak and low on brainpower. Many who have cleansed say those feelings pass and are replaced by energy, stamina and bliss \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t the case for me. I did lose a few pounds, but they came back (plus more) as soon as I started eating solid foods. Maybe it was that particular cleanse, I decided. I needed to try something else. At this point, I\u2019ve done seven. I experimented with brands, cleanse types, phase-in and phase-out strategies, exercising and not exercising \u2014 you name it, I\u2019ve tried it. But just like my personality, my body is stubborn. And every time I\u2019ve limited my intake to liquids, my body simply wanted food \u2014 real, solid, \u00adnutrient-dense food. So why did I continue to torture myself? For one, I love trying new trends, diets and means of reaching my full physical and mental potential. I also love food, eating a lot of it and having a few drinks to help wash it all down. Naturally, that can lead to weight gain, and instead of being patient and getting back on track, sometimes I want an easy way to get back to the body I\u2019m used to (and to get out of elastic pants). Plus I have a history of injuries, and as an athlete, it can be difficult to adjust food intake to a body that isn\u2019t hitting the gym six days a week. Cleansing will solve all those problems, right? Wrong. And here\u2019s why: **1\\. Your body needs protein and fiber.** Protein is often associated with gaining serious muscle, but it\u2019s necessary for every body type \u2014 weightlifters and yogis alike. Not only does protein help muscles recover, it also helps promote a healthy weight by keeping you full and fueled. Protein also provides essential amino acids the body can\u2019t produce on its own. And, sadly, juice provides little to no protein (unless you\u2019re doing a cleanse that includes nut milk, but that still has a low amount). As for fiber, most people don\u2019t get enough as is. If constipation, low energy and frequent hunger pangs aren\u2019t reason enough to up your intake, consider this: A high-fiber diet also reduces risk for heart disease. Many fruits have a healthful serving of fiber, but the process of juicing them and discarding their nutrient-rich outer layer cuts down on the fiber that makes it into your cup. The one thing you\u2019re still getting plenty of in juices is sugar. Which leads me to my next point . . . **2\\. Eating fruit is much more healthful than drinking it.** While juice cleanses may seem like an easy way to load up on vitamins and minerals, they\u2019re often full of added sugars and devoid of the good stuff (such as fiber and antioxidants). Juicing fruits does tend to preserve some vitamins, but why guzzle several hundred calories\u2019 worth of fruit when you can eat one serving and actually feel full? Plus, all that juice can actually lead to Type 2 diabetes, whereas eating fruit reduces the risk. **3\\. Juice is expensive.** Cleansing, whether you\u2019re making the juice at home or buying a prepackaged one, can cost a pretty penny. In fact, for the price of the average cleanse (around $180 for three days), you can buy two weeks\u2019 worth of groceries for yourself \u2014 even at a high-end grocery store. Why not cut back on booze and caffeine for a week and splurge on a massage or class package at your favorite fitness studio instead of hopping on another cleanse? And because studies have found few actual health benefits to detox diets, including cleanses, you\u2019re essentially throwing your hard-earned cash to the wind. **4\\. Crash diets don\u2019t work.** Losing 12 pounds in two weeks may sound great, but it\u2019s tough to keep it off. When you deprive yourself of sugar and carbohydrates, the likelihood of eventually returning to old habits, and bingeing in the process, is high. The better option: Make small, meaningful changes, such as cutting back on processed foods and drinking more water, one at a time. **5\\. Cleansing makes you feel crummy.** Sure, several cleansing testimonies say that the results were incredible: \u201cMy body has never looked better,\u201d \u201cMy mind has never been clearer,\u201d \u201cI have more energy than a puppy.\u201d And while that may be true for some, for others \u2014 like me \u2014 it isn\u2019t. The lack of nutrients in juice cleanses can cause hunger, fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, a rapid heartbeat, temperature fluctuations, impatience and a whole slew of discomfort. And to think: This is what you\u2019re choosing to do and paying for. Thanks, but no thanks. I\u2019ll take feeling awesome for free. **6\\. Your body detoxes itself naturally.** After you overindulge, purging your system of toxins with a cleanse sounds appealing. But that\u2019s what our organs are for. The liver is constantly working to help purify the body. Our kidneys do the same every time we urinate. And so do our intestines: Every time we defecate, we\u2019re getting rid of things our body doesn\u2019t need (or want). Eating healthfully can help our organs do their jobs more efficiently: We don\u2019t need to drink liquid for days on end to accomplish that. At this point, I think it\u2019s obvious that I\u2019ve given up on cleansing. Not only did it put my body through a roller coaster of stomachaches, cramps, fainting spells and a lack of focus, but I also never accomplished my goals of feeling better and losing weight. Instead, I have identified the things that make me feel bad and those I tend to overindulge in, and I have created my own plan that helps me get back to feeling good when I need it. For seven to 10 days, I remove caffeine, alcohol, dairy, meat and anything processed from my diet. I fuel up on whole foods such as fruit, vegetables, lentils, eggs and a whole lot of water and herbal tea. While I\u2019m doing that, I decrease my level of exercise and limit myself to such things as long walks, restorative yoga and 15-minute steam room or sauna sessions. By the end of my \u201ccleanse,\u201d I feel energized, healthy, happy and fit \u2014 even if I\u2019m not fitting into my skinny jeans perfectly. I\u2019ve also found that it helps to \u201cdetox\u201d my mind, at the same time.

It may not be double-digit weight loss, but I\u2019ll take it. This story was excerpted from Greatist.com.", "Title: Does eating fat make you fat? This doctor says no. Content: The weight-loss industry has long been saturated with gimmicky, too-good-to-be-true diets, so one could be excused for thinking the main benefit of \u201cEat Fat, Get Thin\u201d is to burn calories by causing particularly vigorous eye-rolling. I mean, doesn\u2019t eating fat, like, make you fat? Actually, the answer is a big, fat no, at least according to Mark Hyman, director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine and the man behind the \u201cEat Fat, Get Thin\u201d plan. He is also, apropos of this moment, a key medical adviser to Hillary and Bill Clinton, but in a recent phone interview, I found him as silent on that topic (citing potential HIPAA violations) as he was expansive on the benefits of healthy fats. Hyman is credited with moving the Clintons to his eating plan \u2014 in Bill\u2019s case, getting the former president, who had gone vegan after quadruple bypass surgery in 2004, to eat some meat and cut down on carbohydrates. For the 56-year-old physician and best-selling author, there are two key concepts: Dietary fat does not, in fact, increase body fat, and all calories are not created equal. \u201cThe misinformation that has been pushed on our population by the food industry and our government, which is that all calories are the same \u2014 that\u2019s true in a laboratory, when you burn them,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not true when you eat them.\u201d In a blog post on his website last year, Hyman compared the effects of consuming 750 calories of soda vs. 750 calories of broccoli, pointing out the many adverse effects of the former, including an insulin spike, which increases the storage of belly fat. In our conversation, he noted, \u201cFat, on the other hand, does not raise insulin.\u201d What healthy fats can do, Hyman wrote in his forthcoming book, \u201cThe Eat Fat, Get Thin Cookbook,\u201d is \u201cshut down cravings, speed up metabolism\u201d and \u201chelp prevent and reverse heart disease, _not_ cause it.\u201d He points the finger at a long-standing and misguided obsession with calories, one that demonizes fats for containing more of them than processed carbohydrates and sugars, leading to \u201cdangerous low-fat diets.\u201d \u201cThe basic idea is that the quality and composition of your diet matters more than the calories,\u201d Hyman told me. In terms of his cookbook, that means not only making sure to eat healthy fats, including \u201cwild fatty fish (sardines, mackerel, herring, wild salmon), grass-fed meat or organic poultry (skin and fat left on), nuts and seeds, avocados, extra-virgin olive oil, and coconut oil,\u201d but even adding fat to coffee. Of course, many of us do that already, in the form of half-and-half, but Hyman is not a fan of most dairy products, except for grass-fed butter and ghee, a form of clarified butter. So, he says, go ahead and mix that into your coffee! Yes, butter. Or, perhaps, MCT (medium-chain triglycerides) oil, a derivative of coconut oil, of which Hyman is a big fan. The Washington Post\u2019s own healthy-eating expert, Ellie Krieger, recently wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t buy into the coconut as cure-all hype, and do stick to unsaturated oil for everyday cooking.\u201d But coconut oil, as well as milk and flour derived from the plant, show up frequently in Hyman\u2019s recipes. The medium-chain fatty acids found in coconuts are a \u201cspecial type of fat that is differentially absorbed by the liver\u201d and help speed up metabolism and curb appetite, he said. Of course, as with any eating regimen (Hyman dislikes the word \u201cdiet\u201d almost as much as he dislikes Twinkies), it\u2019s not all coconut-flavored fun and buttery games. The shoe that\u2019s waiting to drop on those going the \u201cEat Fat, Get Thin\u201d route is, for many, a drastic reduction in dietary sugar and carbohydrates. \u201cFor the first few days, it\u2019s often very challenging,\u201d Hyman said of his plan. He doesn\u2019t tell people to eliminate sugar entirely, but he refers to it as \u201ca recreational drug.\u201d In fact, Hyman\u2019s emphasis on avoiding processed foods \u2014 \u201cleave the food that man made and eat the food that God made,\u201d he says \u2014 and most dairy products constitutes a hybrid of the Paleo diet and veganism, or what he calls \u201cPegan.\u201d \u201cIts really a way of eating that your body was designed for, which is what we\u2019ve been eating for thousands and thousands of years,\u201d he said. Sugar and flour \u201care really new foods for us, and yet now they\u2019re the most abundant sources of our calories.\u201d What Hyman prescribes is for \u201cslow carbs or non-starchy plant foods,\u201d such as green leafy veggies, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers and bok choy, to \u201cmake up 75 percent of your plate,\u201d along with four to six ounces of protein. The good news is that, instead of having to squeeze a lemon onto the broccoli or using some similarly low-fat condiment, you can add some EVOO or avocado to it. \u201cBy volume, it\u2019s pretty much non-starchy plant foods,\u201d Hyman said of his plan. \u201cBy calories, it\u2019s mostly fat.\u201d Bill Clinton, who appears to have lost plenty of weight since his White House days, seems to be a fan of the plan. The work of Hyman, who, according to a 2014 New York Times profile , was introduced to him by Hillary in 2005, \u201cinspired\u201d him to make \u201cdrastic changes to [his] own diet and exercise routine,\u201d the former president said in a testimonial on the physician\u2019s website. Hyman also pointed me toward work by others that bolsters his position, including a 2012 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association positing that \u201ca strategy to reduce glycemic load rather than dietary fat may be advantageous for weight-loss maintenance and cardiovascular disease prevention.\u201d In a personal testimonial in his cookbook, Hyman wrote, \u201cI\u2019m now eating more calories and losing more weight, and I eat fat with every single meal!\u201d That sounds pretty palatable, although it helps that I\u2019m already a fan of broccoli and sardines. In case you\u2019re wondering, I have yet to try the \u201cEat Fat, Get Thin\u201d di . . . er, eating regimen, although heaven knows I could stand to lose some weight. My wife and I have been experimenting with coconut oil, though, so maybe I\u2019ll take a baby step by mixing some into my coffee.

But something else was going on. Content: To Deborah E. Savage, a trip to the doctor was frequently an exercise in humiliation. For more than 15 years, Savage\u2019s doctors doled out the same advice: You need to stop gaining weight. When Savage replied that she had tried watching her diet and exercising, only to pack on more pounds, it was clear they simply didn\u2019t believe her. Her family was equally skeptical. \u201cI would eat like my sister, and I would gain weight but she wouldn\u2019t,\u201d recalled Savage, a civil engineer who lives in Montgomery County and turns 31 next month. Savage\u2019s inexorable weight gain, which began in middle school and resulted in obesity, was not her only problem: For years, she also struggled with eruptions of painful acne and facial hair. \u201cThese things made me feel ugly,\u201d she said. Last year, after Savage had trouble getting pregnant, an inability she suspected was linked to her irregular periods, she consulted a new obstetrician/gynecologist. The doctor suggested that Savage\u2019s constellation of problems might have a single cause. But it took a second OB/GYN to conduct the proper tests, which led to a definitive diagnosis of a common \u2014 and consequential \u2014 disorder. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to me that so many doctors\u201d didn\u2019t think of this, she said. \u201cIf I\u2019d known, I would have made changes years ago.\u201d From the time she was 12, Savage recalled, her inability to lose weight became one of the defining elements of her life. And because she is short \u2014 5-foot-3 \u2014 extra pounds were particularly noticeable. Her family\u2019s comparisons with her older, thinner sister rankled. At her mother\u2019s suggestion, Savage joined a gym, but that didn\u2019t help her lose more than a few pounds. Savage said she was too intimidated to ask her doctors why her weight didn\u2019t budge much, even when she faithfully followed a diet and worked out. Nor did she mention the other problems that plagued her. \u201cThe facial hair thing was embarrassing, so I didn\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cSame with the acne. I felt so sensitive about it.\u201d Savage wasn\u2019t sure what to make of her irregular menstrual periods, but doctors did not seem concerned. At times she went three months without a period; at other times they lasted for two weeks. She managed to lose a little weight in college, but her acne and other problems persisted. In her early 20s, Savage said, her gynecologist chided her about how heavy she was; every year, she seemed to gain 10 pounds. \u201cI explained that I had tried diet and exercise, but he said I was not trying hard enough,\u201d Savage recalled. To regulate her menstrual cycle and tame her acne, the doctor prescribed oral contraceptives, which helped clear her skin and made her periods somewhat less irregular. When she got married in 2010, Savage and her husband joined a popular weight-loss program to see whether they could motivate each other. Savage said she lost only about eight pounds after several months, while her husband, who followed the same diet, had no trouble shedding much more weight. \u201cIt was very frustrating,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was serious about following the rules, but it didn\u2019t pay off. I kind of gave up.\u201d By early 2015, she was desperate. She had stopped taking the pill nearly a year earlier, in hopes of getting pregnant; without it, her acne had roared back and her facial-hair problem had worsened. Savage was at her heaviest weight \u2014 about 240 pounds \u2014 and her family doctor warned that her cholesterol, at 210 mg/dL, was too high. In March, sheswitched gynecologists. Her new doctor zeroed in on her irregular periods and her weight and asked Savage whether she had heard of a metabolic disorder called polycystic ovarian (or ovary) syndrome. Savage replied that a friend in college had been diagnosed with PCOS. She was surprised when the doctor responded that she suspected Savage might have it, too. PCOS is a common hormonal imbalance that often begins in puberty and affects as many as 10 percent of women. Its cause is unknown, but heredity appears to play a role: Women whose mothers or sisters have the disorder are at higher risk. Many women with PCOS have enlarged ovaries containing fluid-filled cysts that produce excess androgens \u2014 male sex hormones, which interfere with ovulation. Other signs of PCOS include irregular, absent or prolonged periods, acne and excess facial and body hair, a condition known as hirsutism. Because it also disrupts the regulation of insulin, many women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The disorder, which can be controlled but not cured, also increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart attack. The gynecologist told Savage that she also suffered from PCOS. When Savage asked whether it was possible to test for the disorder, she said that the gynecologist told her, erroneously, that there were no tests. The best way to treat the problem was to lose weight, the doctor advised. And, the gynecologist added, she held weight-loss seminars in her office and urged Savage to sign up. Savage declined. Two weeks later, she consulted a third OB/GYN, Neil Horlick, who practices in Montgomery and Frederick counties. Horlick, after taking her history and performing an exam, said he suspected she had PCOS. When Savage told him she had been told there was no test for it, he assured her that testing was available and that he would order it. Because abnormalities of the thyroid or adrenal glands can cause similar symptoms, those must be ruled out first. PCOS is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion, made on the basis of blood tests, a patient\u2019s symptoms and an ultrasound of the ovaries. \u201cWe generally look for two out of three criteria for PCOS,\u201d Horlick said. These include a history of irregular or absent periods, elevated levels of male hormones, particularly testosterone, and the presence of ovarian cysts. In Savage\u2019s case, an ultrasound showed no cysts, but she did have an elevated testosterone level. Horlick said he was surprised that Savage\u2019s condition went undiagnosed for so long. \u201cPCOS is always on our radar\u201d when a patient with irregular periods complains of weight gain and hirsutism, Horlick said. He told Savage that her best chance of getting pregnant involved losing weight. Horlick prescribed metformin, a diabetes drug that can promote weight loss. Metformin is commonly given to PCOS patients and may help promote ovulation as well. Savage decided to take a new approach to food. She began following a paleo diet, which emphasizes meat, vegetables, nuts and fruit, and drastically reduces the intake of carbohydrates, sugar and processed foods. The first month, she said, she was elated to discover that she had lost 15 pounds; between April and September, she shed 50 pounds and her cholesterol dropped 20 points. Her acne also improved, her level of testosterone dropped, and her menstrual cycle became more regular. Savage said she asked relatives whether anyone else had been diagnosed with PCOS. \u201cMy parents had never heard of it,\u201d she said. In October 2015, she and her husband were elated to learn that she was pregnant with identical twin boys. Savage spent six weeks hospitalized at Maryland\u2019s Shady Grove Medical Center under close observation, because her twins have a rare condition in which they share a single amniotic sac and placenta, a condition unrelated to PCOS. The babies were born April 22. Savage said she hopes that her experience will spare other women from \u201cstruggling for years the way I did.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a bizarre disorder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take [this many] doctors to find out, when I have a textbook case.\u201d **Read more:** He went from playful little boy to a \u2018zombie.\u2019 Why wouldn\u2019t the doctors listen?

I can\u2019t remember what exactly it was that had gotten her upset. I think I\u2019d written something mean about cats. But, really, how mad can you get at a John Kelly column? It\u2019s like getting mad at a puppy. I don\u2019t remember the specifics, but I do remember one thing she wrote: \u201cI\u2019ve seen your picture. You look like someone who eats a lot of meat.\u201d The point of her insult was this: You\u2019re fat, Kelly. Rude. But not entirely untrue. I think of myself as the inverse of a lyric in that **Bob Seger** song \u201cNight Moves.\u201d Less \u201cI was a little too tall, could\u2019ve used a few pounds\u201d and more \u201cI\u2019m a little too short, could stand to lose a few pounds.\u201d But how? In college I dated a girl who was forever going on diets with her sister. There would be six weeks of a grapefruit-centric diet, followed by six weeks of a cucumber-centric diet, followed by six weeks of whatever faddish weight-loss technique they\u2019d picked up: cottage cheese with honey, yogurt and coffee grounds strained through a window screen, steel-cut oats eaten while standing on their heads . . . That was back when we didn\u2019t know that the best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. It sounds so obvious now. Obvious, but not easy. Food tastes so good. Exercise is so boring. A few years ago I bought one of those fitness tracker things and started logging my meals. I synced everything to my phone, which knew exactly how much I was eating and how many steps I was taking. It took this information and made all sorts of pretty graphs: line charts and bar charts and pie charts. (Mmm, _pie_ . . .) I lost weight. You might have thought this would\u2019ve made My Lovely Wife happy. It didn\u2019t, exactly. Logging my Raisin Bran Crunch, disappearing into the basement to run on the treadmill, jauntily stepping onto the bathroom scale and announcing my latest weight-loss triumph \u2014 My Lovely Wife reacted to all of this with clenched jaw. \u201cI know what\u2019s going on,\u201d I said. \u201cYou _want_ me unattractive, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re afraid that if I\u2019m ripped, other women will throw themselves at me and take me from you. Why else would you keep buying Oreos and putting them where I can reach them?\u201d She laughed a bitter laugh. I had forgotten that many women have a fraught relationship with dieting. They spent their teenage years straining yogurt and coffee grounds through window screens, losing a few pounds in the process but then watching in horror as they came roaring back. My weight-loss mania had been like a trigger for my wife, a rebuke even: Look at me! _I\u2019m dieting_. She needn\u2019t have worried. My fitness tracker stopped working, then the company that made it went out of business. Our dog died, depriving me of the few thousands steps that his daily walks required of me. Oreo came out with Oreo Thins, which may as well be called \u201cOreos Eat More of Us Because You Think We\u2019re \u2018Healthy.\u2019 \u201d I\u2019m worse off than ever. I\u2019m reminded of this every time I look in my closet. There are some shirts in there that don\u2019t fit. To be fair, they\u2019ve never fit. They\u2019re shirts that I liked the look of and bought without trying on, gullibly believing the size on the label. I can\u2019t bring myself to give them away, because I know someday they will look great on me. My Lovely Wife laughs that bitter laugh. Buy clothes that fit you, she says, not ones you aspire to fit into. No, I say. They\u2019re _incentives_. After I get a new fitness tracker and a new dog and some new willpower, there\u2019s going to be a new me. I\u2019m probably still going to want to eat meat, though.

Canisters containing the tiny aircraft descended from the jets on parachutes before breaking open, allowing wings on each drone to swing out and catch the wind. Inch-wide propellers on the back provided propulsion as they found one another and created a swarm. The experiment was run by the secretive Strategic Capabilities Office, a Pentagon organization launched in summer 2012 to figure out how to best counter growing strategic threats from China and Russia. The specifics of what the mini-drones can do are classified, but they could be used to confuse enemy forces and carry out surveillance missions using equipment that costs much less than full-sized unmanned aircraft. Video reviewed by The Washington Post shows the tiny aircraft, which weigh about a pound each, moving in packs and gaining situational awareness after sitting inert in the flare canisters. SCO\u2019s staff labored in the shadows since its inception, with virtually everything it did withheld from the American public. But the shroud of secrecy was lifted partially in recent weeks. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter for the first time disclosed last month the existence of some of the office\u2019s projects while previewing his proposed 2017 budget. He called for $902 million in funding for SCO in 2017 \u2014 nearly twice what it received this year, and 18 times what it started with. _[Watch Perdix, the Pentagon\u2019s secretive program dropping tiny drones from fighter jets]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Carter\u2019s disclosures raised some questions in the Pentagon about whether he had revealed classified information while previewing his 2017 budget. But in a rare interview, the director of SCO said the secretary sought a green light to disclose snippets of the mini-drone experiment in Alaska and a few other programs as part of a broader effort to get the attention of potential adversaries. \u201cI have been in the classified, black world for my whole career, so all of this is new for me and I really wish I could go back,\u201d said the director, William Roper, a physicist who previously worked in missile defense. \u201cYou can\u2019t win wars if everything is outside the doors, but you can\u2019t deter wars if everything is behind them.\u201d The story of SCO \u2014 pronounced \u201cSkoh\u201d \u2014 is one that underscores the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to move beyond more than a decade of counterterrorism operations and combat in Iraq and Afghanistan to prepare for new strategic threats. The office initially called the Pentagon home, but was later moved a few miles away to a larger space in the same building in Virginia that houses the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), perhaps the Defense Department\u2019s best known agency focused on futuristic technology. But DARPA and SCO are different organizations with different missions, both Roper and DARPA officials said. DARPA, created during the Cold War in 1958, is focused on looking for ways to revolutionize military operations with new inventions and technology. It has an annual budget of about $3 billion. SCO is charged with creating new \u201ctrick plays\u201d for the Pentagon through creativity and engineering, using old weapons, teaming existing equipment together or adding new commercial technology. Roper, 36, compared the U.S. military to a top football team that has been closely studied for years by opponents who want to exploit potential weaknesses they have observed. \u201cFootball teams \u2013 great football teams, dynasties \u2013 don\u2019t throw out their playbook when that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Alright, well, my opponents have optimized against what I do today, so I\u2019ve got to get surprise and get trickery back on my side.\u2019 So they weave trick plays into their playbooks. They start running when it looks like they\u2019re going to pass, and pass when it looks like they\u2019re going to run. They force their opponent to play honestly by catching them off-guard early in the game. I think that analogue holds very well for us.\u201d DARPA\u2019s director, Arati Prabhakar, said in a statement that SCO\u2019s focus on addressing immediate needs adds to a robust research ecosystem that includes both the public and private sectors. \u201cIn a world of fast-morphing technologies and diverse threats, no single military capability or tech development strategy is going to ensure our national security,\u201d she said. _[Infantry overhaul: How DARPA\u2019s new experiments could shake up ground warfare]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico SCO\u2019s public emergence comes as the Pentagon continues to look for new ways to adapt more quickly. Last week, the Defense Department announced it would establish a new Defense Innovation Advisory Board run by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. It also opened an office in Silicon Valley last spring to strengthen relationships with technology companies there, who have historically not collaborated much with the Defense Department. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico SCO was \u201cessentially built around one smart guy\u201d \u2014 Roper \u2014 who impressed Carter several years ago, the defense secretary said last week while in San Francisco. Carter, then the deputy defense secretary, challenged Roper to tackle problems confronting the Pentagon and he \u201cfound solution after solution after solution,\u201d the secretary recalled. \u201cAll of our service chiefs, our Joint Chiefs of Staff, love the guy because he\u2019s providing real solutions ~~~~,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSo there are ways that you can be an exception to what I know is the rule of the government: [being] ponderous.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The belief, Roper said, is that U.S. troops are bright enough to find new ways to use existing weapons. And some plans are extremely ambitious: One new project not previously reported is called Avatar, and calls for the Pentagon to pair high-tech \u201cfifth-generation\u201d fighter jets like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter with unmanned versions of older jets like the F-16 Fighting Falcon or F/A-18 Hornet, which would be flown without a pilot for the first time. The Avatar effort was previously called Skyborg by SCO and is known as \u201cthe Loyal Wingman\u201d concept in the Air Force, Roper said. The program will require unmanned fighters to act with enough autonomy that the pilot in the manned jet doesn\u2019t have to direct them all the time. \u201cThere will be a lot of questions on safety, on reliability of the links between the planes,\u201d Roper said. \u201cAll of these things have to be resolved. Bringing up that point is exactly what we try to infuse in the folks in our office. If there\u2019s a question where you say, \u2018Oh, we can worry about that later\u2026\u2019 Nope, we\u2019re going to worry about that now.\u201d _[Why drones will buzz to the forefront in the new Pentagon budget]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Another early concept is adapting the Navy\u2019s Standard Missile-6 to be able to strike enemy ships. The missiles, filed vertically from the decks of destroyers and cruisers, were originally envisioned to intercept ballistic missiles high in the atmosphere, but are now considered dual-use following a recent experiment by the Navy. The office also has worked on a concept known as Arsenal Plane. It calls for an undisclosed plane to carry a variety of weapons that can be directed by nearby stealth fighters like the F-22. The Pentagon wants to build a prototype next year, and says it could be ready for combat by the 2020s, Roper said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to develop new planes,\u201d Roper said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to develop fundamentally new weapons. But we have to work the integration and the concept of operation. And then you have a completely new capability, but you don\u2019t have to wait long at all.\u201d The office currently has six full-time government employees and about 20 contractors, Roper said. Many details about the organization remain classified, but it receives technical support from several contractors who specialize in part on simulation and modeling, including Modern Technology Solutions Inc., in Alexandria, Va., and Science Applications International Corp. in McLean, Va. The mini-drones were tested over Alaska last year as part of the military exercise Northern Edge, which focuses on training for crises in the Pacific. The program is named after Perdix, a character in Greek mythology who was changed into a partridge by the god Athena. It costs about $20 million, Roper said. The drones are constructed using 3-D printing \u2014 important considering the specific size needed to launch them through an aircraft\u2019s flare dispenser and the toughness needed to survive such a violent birth. Roper said SCO has been testing the mini-drones since 2014, but last year\u2019s experiment during Northern Edge showed that they can find each other while airborne and create a swarm. Perdix drones were tested 150 times during the exercise in Alaska, including 72 from fighter jets. They also can be launched from the ground by U.S. troops, either with a slingshot-like launcher or by hurling them. **More military technology stories on Checkpoint:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Watch LOCUST, the Navy\u2019s new prototype launcher to send drones into the sky *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico DARPA\u2019s new experimental sniper bullet can turn in mid-flight *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Watch how DARPA\u2019s new close air support system works on an A-10 attack jet *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Robots, swarming drones and \u2018Iron Man\u2019: Welcome to the new arms race Content: In his quest to transform the way the Pentagon wages war, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter has turned to Silicon Valley, hoping its experimental culture, innovation and sense of urgency would rub off on the rigid bureaucracy he runs. Carter has made several trips to the Valley and appointed Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google\u2019s parent company to an advisory board. And recently he sat down at the Pentagon with Elon Musk to see what suggestions the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX might have to make the nation\u2019s military more efficient and daring. Musk\u2019s answer? \u201cHaving an incentive structure that rewards innovation is extremely important,\u201d he said in an interview after the meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s economics 101. Whatever you reward will happen.\u201d The Pentagon finds itself in a new arms race, struggling to keep pace with forms of combat that are fought with bytes as well as bullets. The technological advancements disrupting established business sectors are now shaking up the world of war \u2014 where robots, swarming drones and weapons enhanced by artificial intelligence might one day rule the skies and seas. And just like in industry, the advantages may be fleeting. The Pentagon is seeking \u201can enduring competitive edge that lasts a generation,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant who serves at the Lexington Institute, a think tank based in Arlington. \u201cBut generations in technology these days are measured in months.\u201d Harnessing the latest technology to upgrade the Defense Department\u2019s arsenal is a top priority for Carter, who recently said, \u201cThe race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than anyone else.\u201d The effort has a renewed energy in the waning months of the Obama administration, which is trying to embed the effort into the bureaucracy \u2014 and budget. The Pentagon is turning to start-ups and steering billions of dollars to its own laboratories and project teams to develop prototypes for the kind of promising technologies it may need in the future. It is testing autonomous ships that can remain at sea for months without a crew, an electromagnetic railgun that fires a projectile that can travel at seven times the speed of sound, and increasingly powerful laser weapons that sizzle their targets. At a recent conference put on by Defense One, a website that provides news and analysis on defense and national security, highlighted an effort to produce \u201crevolutionary textiles that combine fibers with electronics to create fabrics that can sense, communicate, store energy, monitor health, change color, and much more.\u201d The Pentagon speaks of its \u201cThird Offset Strategy,\u201d a way to offset shrinking budgets and transient technological superiority. The first offset was the use of nuclear deterrence to keep the Soviets at bay starting in the 1950s. The second was the advent of new precision munitions and stealth to overwhelm robust air and ground forces of adversaries. The Pentagon hopes that this is the dawn of a third technological revolution, even if the conditions are markedly different. Instead of trying to offset the advantages of a single, traditional adversary, the Pentagon faces challenges on multiple fronts, including large, technologically advanced nations such as Russia and China, smaller, aspiring powers such as North Korea, and independent non-state actors such as the Islamic State. As part of the earlier offset campaigns the Pentagon adopted military capabilities that emerged from its own labs. But big advances in robotics, biotechnology and computing are coming out of the commercial sector, much of which wants little to do with the Pentagon. This round has gotten off to a fitful start, if for no other reason than the skepticism aroused by the late-term push of an outgoing administration. There are also doubts about nurturing a start-up mentality in a bureaucracy that must hew to drawn-out and unpredictable budget cycles. Some companies are \u201cwatching to see how serious this is,\u201d said Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cIs this a fad? Is this going to last beyond this administration? And part of the problem is the acquisition system impedes this sort of development.\u201d Musk said he and Carter had a \u201chigh-level\u201d discussion not about procurement programs but about innovation. One of Musk\u2019s suggestions was that the Pentagon needs to embrace failure. \u201cWhenever you do try to do things that are new, and you\u2019re in unchartered territory, there will be failures because you don\u2019t know the path,\u201d Musk said. \u201cThere should be no penalty for a failure where it was thoughtful and considered.\u201d But in a massive and often risk-averse bureaucracy, that might be easier said than done. Nevertheless, the Pentagon plans over the next five years to invest $18 billion in the Third Offset, including about $6 billion in the classified \u201cblack\u201d budget, according to Mackenzie Eaglen, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense issues. The Defense Department opened an outreach center in Silicon Valley to encourage some of the most innovative start-ups to turn their attention to national security. And when that effort showed mixed results in its first year, Carter moved unusually fast to overhaul it, installing new leadership that reports directly to him. He also announced that the Pentagon would open a similar office in Boston. The shake-up in Silicon Valley was done specifically \u201cto signal to the bureaucracy that this is of the highest priority to the department,\u201d Eaglen said. \u201cThe entire president\u2019s budget was built around the Third Offset and the threats that Carter believes the U.S. military should be prepared to confront.\u201d After decades of unmatched superiority, the Pentagon fears that potential adversaries have benefited from the proliferation of commercial technology and have caught up with the United States. The Pentagon is preparing for what Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work called \u201cnetwork-on-network warfare\u201d against more traditional rivals, such as China and Russia, after more than a decade of counterinsurgency warfare in Iraq and Afghanistan. The idea is that \u201cadvances in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems [are] going to lead to a new era of human-machine collaboration and combat teaming,\u201d he said during a recent event at the Atlantic Council, an international-affairs think tank. The goal is not \u201ckiller robots that roam the battlefield,\u201d said Work, a self-proclaimed science fiction fan. \u201cI think more in terms of \u2018Iron Man\u2019 \u2014 the ability of a machine to assist a human, where the human is still in control in all matters, but the machine makes the human much more powerful and much more capable.\u201d Much of the work is being done in the Pentagon\u2019s top-secret labs, at places such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Office of Naval Research and the secretive Strategic Capabilities Office. The ONR is based in a nondescript office building in Arlington, Va., just down the block from DARPA. The low-profile agency employs 4,000 scientists around the world and funds research at universities and throughout industry. At any given time, about 12,000 projects are underway, and the agency produces 350 to 400 technical patents a year, said Rear Adm. Mathias Winter, the chief of naval research. In 70 years in existence, the agency has funded 60 Nobel laureates. \u201cWe want to do the impossible, can\u2019t-be-done, there\u2019s-no-way-that\u2019ll-ever-happen problems,\u201d Winter said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what scientists do. We do magic. And the engineers have to do the miracle.\u201d Next month, the magic will come in the form of a swarm of 30 small drones that will fly together like a flock of birds, \u201cbreak off a cadre to be able to potentially go attack something . . . and then come back and regroup and go,\u201d Winter said. Lasers \u2014 yes, think Star Wars \u2014 are another priority. In 2014, the Navy deployed a $40 million, 30-kilowatt laser that was mounted on the deck of the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. Service members practiced taking out drones and small boats using a video-game-like controller. Now it is fully operational, and the Pentagon could record its first kill with a laser. The technology is moving fast, and by 2018, ONR plans to test a 150-kilowatt laser on a ship that will be five times more powerful than one on the USS Ponce. At DARPA, the Third Offset is viewed differently from the previous offset strategies, which gave the United States a firm lead over its adversaries for decades. This time, the effort is seen as much more dynamic, using technologies that evolve quickly over time, said Arati Prabhakar, the agency\u2019s director. Sometimes that will come through software that\u2019s easy to upgrade. Or through artificial intelligence, so that machines will be able to learn and adapt on their own. \u201cWhere are the breakthroughs going to come from?\u201d she said. \u201cA theme is if you combine access to leading-edge commercial technology and deeply integrate it with DOD [Department of Defense] secret sauce, that\u2019s where you get phenomenal advancements in capabilities.\u201d One example is DARPA\u2019s 132-foot-long autonomous ship. From the outside, it looks like another military ship. But without a crew, it can venture into hostile territory without the risk of human casualties, and it is \u201cdesigned to go many thousands of nautical miles and has a tiny fraction of the operating cost of a destroyer,\u201d Prabhakar said. Despite the push to attract the talent and technology of Silicon Valley, traditional defense contractors say they continue to innovate. BAE Systems, for example, is working on \u201ccognitive electronic warfare,\u201d which helps aircraft defend against radar systems, often adapting to threats in the moment. Raytheon, a big defense contractor based outside Boston, has advanced artificial intelligence by creating small robots, Hercules and Athena, that run on solar power but are programmed to stay out of the light. That conflict created what scientists likened to hunger, and a life-death balance that the machines had to sort out on their own. The company also has developed a tablet computer that could call in an airstrike with as few as three clicks \u2014 when not engaged in more familiar tasks, such as enabling soldiers in the field to chat as if they were sitting at their desks or share maps and video. Another version of the software, Jump Master, is designed to give paratroopers information on wind direction and targets on the ground. The goal is to \u201cdrive speed\u201d in an effort to help soldiers make better decisions faster, said Tom Kennedy, Raytheon\u2019s chief executive. The information streaming on the tablet will help soldiers decide \u201cwhat type of weapons to use, where the threats are located, what\u2019s the best maneuver to be able to win and defeat the threat.\u201d But to provide innovative technology with a secure pipeline to the battlefield, the Pentagon has to institutionalize the program so that it can survive a change in administration, analysts said. That is why the senior leadership has given speech after speech about the strategy, and why they have rushed to get these technologies in development. Eaglen, at the American Enterprise Institute said, \u201cThey\u2019ve planted the seeds that will be sprouting for the next team.\u201d", "Title: The exotic new weapons the Pentagon wants to deter Russia and China Content: Little noticed amid the daily news bulletins about the Islamic State and Syria, the Pentagon has begun a push for exotic new weapons that can deter Russia and China. Pentagon officials have started talking openly about using the latest tools of artificial intelligence and machine learning to create robot weapons, \u201chuman-machine teams\u201d and enhanced, super-powered soldiers. It may sound like science fiction, but Pentagon officials say they have concluded that such high-tech systems are the best way to combat rapid improvements by the Russian and Chinese militaries. These potentially revolutionary U.S. weapons systems were explained in an interview last week by Robert Work, the deputy secretary of defense, and Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Their comments were the latest in a series of unusual recent disclosures about what, until a few months ago, was some of the military\u2019s most secret research. \u201cThis is how we will make our battle networks more powerful, hopefully, and inject enough uncertainty in the minds of the Russians and the Chinese that, you know, if they ever did come to blows with us, would be able to prevail in a conventional [non-nuclear] way. That, for me, is the definition of conventional deterrence,\u201d Work explained. Within the Pentagon, this high-tech approach is known by the dull phrase \u201cthird offset strategy,\u201d emulating two earlier \u201coffsets\u201d that checked Russian military advances during the Cold War. The first offset was tactical nuclear weapons; the second was precision-guided conventional weapons. The latest version assumes that smart, robot weapons can help restore deterrence that has been eroded by Russian and Chinese progress. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, voiced an early warning during his confirmation hearing in July when he said that Russia posed the greatest \u201cexistential\u201d threat to the United States. Work said in a recent speech that because the United States has focused on the Middle East since 2001, \u201cour program has been slow to adapt as these high-end threats have started to re-emerge.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s 2017 budget includes some money to prime the high-tech pump: $3 billion for advanced weapons to counter, say, a Chinese long-range attack on U.S. naval forces; $3 billion to upgrade undersea systems; $3 billion for human-machine teaming and \u201cswarming\u201d operations by unmanned drones; $1.7 billion for cyber and electronic systems that use artificial intelligence; and $500 million for war-gaming and other testing of the new concepts. The Obama administration, sometimes chided for being slow to respond to Russian and Chinese threats, seems to have concluded that America\u2019s best strategy is to leverage its biggest advantage, which is technology. The concepts are reminiscent of President Reagan\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d initiative, but 30 years on. The high-tech resurgence got a boost last year from the blue-ribbon Defense Science Board, which conducted a \u201csummer study\u201d of autonomous, robot weapons. \u201cImagine if we are unprepared to counter such capabilities in the hands of our adversaries,\u201d the board warned. The game partly is about messaging the Russians and Chinese. Work has described Russia as \u201ca resurgent great power\u201d and China as \u201ca rising power with impressive latent technological capabilities [that] probably embodies a more enduring strategic challenge.\u201d In a Feb. 2 budget announcement, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter spoke of Russian \u201caggression\u201d in Europe and said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t had to worry about this for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.\u201d Carter raised some eyebrows in that budget message when he described the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cStrategic Capabilities Office,\u201d a highly classified initiative that he began in 2012 when he was undersecretary. He noted that the office was working on advanced navigation for smart weapons using micro-cameras and sensors; missile-defense systems using hypervelocity projectiles; and swarming drones that are \u201creally fast, really resistant.\u201d Work illustrated the new willingness to discuss exotic weaponry. During the interview, he showed off a small \u201cPerdix\u201d micro-drone, less than a foot long, which flew with 25 of its mates in a tight grid last summer after being launched from a large plane. These organized drones are part of the Pentagon\u2019s vision of future combat. The Ukraine and Syria battlefields have offered sobering demonstrations of Russian capabilities. In the interview and other public comments, Work catalogued Russian military advances that include automated battle networks, advanced sensors, drones, anti-personnel weapons and jamming devices. \u201cOur adversaries, quite frankly, are pursuing enhanced human operations,\u201d Work warned a gathering at the Center for a New American Security in December. \u201cAnd it scares the crap out of us, really.\u201d _Read more fromDavid Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ **Read more about this topic:** David Ignatius: A frightening preview of the rise of killer robots Editorial: Vladimir Putin lays out a menacing choice for the West Mark Jacobson: Five myths about Obama\u2019s drone war", "Title: The killer robot threat: Pentagon examining how enemy nations could empower machines Content: The Pentagon\u2019s No. 2 civilian official said Wednesday that the Defense Department is concerned that adversary nations could empower advanced weapons systems to act on their own, noting that while the United States will not give them the authority to kill autonomously, other countries might. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert O. Work said the Pentagon hasn\u2019t \u201cfully figured out\u201d the issue of autonomous machines, but continues to examine it. The U.S. military has built a force that relies heavily on the decision-making skills of its troops, but \u201cauthoritarian regimes\u201d may find weapons that can act independently more attractive because doing so would consolidate the ability to take action among a handful of leaders, he said. \u201cWe will not delegate lethal authority to a machine to make a decision,\u201d Work said. \u201cThe only time we will\u2026 delegate a machine authority is in things that go faster than human reaction time, like cyber or electronic warfare.\u201d Work\u2019s comments came during the first of a series of live Washington Post events called \u201cSecuring Tomorrow\u201d and hosted by columnist David Ignatius. Work said the United States is likely to narrowly use artificial intelligence in the next five to 10 years, pointing, for instance, to self-parking vehicles. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The event focused heavily on how the Pentagon is preparing for the future through what it calls a Third Offset Strategy, in which the military is seeking to counter the military advances of adversaries. The concept gets its name from two earlier \u201coffsets.\u201d In the first, the Pentagon developed tactical nuclear weapons during the Cold War. In the second, the military introduced the use of GPS to precisely guide a variety of bombs and missiles on the battlefield. The Third Offset Strategy focuses on the introduction of machine learning \u2014 networks of machines that work together and the distribution of military force through the use of drone swarms and other technologies. Work said Wednesday that it means the Pentagon will not try to match its adversaries \u201ctank-for-tank, gun-for-gun, missile-for-missile, person-for-person,\u201d and instead will offset enemy strengths in other ways. \u201cThis is a much more dynamic strategy than we had in the Cold War,\u201d Work said. \u201cThen we had one, single opponent. It was a very stable competition, and we kind of understood the way they were going. We knew the areas where we could pick where we would dominate the competition, like in information technologies and precision-guided munitions. This is much more dynamic environment in which a lot of military-relevant technologies are coming from the commercial sector.\u201d Asked if the Pentagon needs to prepare for robot warfare, Work said the United States must begin working its \u201cstrategic muscles\u201d more than it has in the last 25 years because of the emergence of China and Russia as threats. Part of that is disclosing new military capabilities to give potential enemies pause, he said. One recent example is the public emergence of the Pentagon\u2019s Strategic Capabilities Office, which had worked mostly in the shadows since it was established in 2012. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter wants it to invent new ways to use old weapons, such as having fighter jets, while in flight, deploy drone swarms. \u201cWe will reveal for deterrence, and we will conceal for war-fighting advantage,\u201d Work said. \u201cThere are a lot of things in the budget that we don\u2019t talk about because we want to preserve that in case, God forbid, deterrence fails and we do come to a conflict of arms.\u201d **Related stories on Checkpoint: ** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Watch LOCUST, the Navy\u2019s new prototype launcher to send drones into the sky *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico DARPA\u2019s new experimental sniper bullet can turn in mid-flight *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Watch how DARPA\u2019s new close air support system works on an A-10 attack jet *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "Title: Forget the doubters, commercial drones are here to stay Content: While obviously there are a lot of technological, legal and regulatory hurdles to overcome before we ever see a fleet of Amazon Prime Air octocopters taking off from distribution centers across America and making door-to-door deliveries, the momentum behind the commercial drone revolution continues to build. There are now over 25,000 DIY drone enthusiasts in America, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototypes already exist for a number of commercial applications. By some estimates, commercial drones could boost the U.S. economy by $13.6 billion and create 70,000 new jobs within just a few years. Once the FAA finally rules on potential applications for commercial drones (expected in late 2015), it will be time for the training wheels to come off the domestic drone bandwagon. *[WSU]: Wayne State University As wacky and futuristic as Amazon\u2019s vision for Prime Air may sound, it\u2019s actually an idea that dates back to at least 2009. FedEx, for example, has even tentatively explored plans for a giant fleet of commercial unmanned drones to deliver packages. That\u2019s right \u2014 the entire FedEx fleet would be comprised of robotic drones. These unmanned delivery vehicles would be more along the lines of massive 777 cargo freighter drones than Amazon octocopters, but you get the idea: the logistics business is looking for a faster, cheaper delivery model and drones are going to be involved somehow. There\u2019s even been talk of drone fleets flying in bird-like formations over cities and then disassembling as they go about their final delivery routes. *[WSU]: Wayne State University In order to think about drones the way Jeff Bezos thinks about drones, just imagine any delivery service being reinvented as a drone delivery service, where robots replace humans. In densely populated urban areas, takeout orders are one example of how consumer drones could revolutionize different business models. In early 2012, for example, there was much speculation about \u201cTacoCopters\u201d eventually being able to deliver tacos to young tech workers in the San Francisco Bay Area using a fleet of quadricopters. But think about it \u2014 any urban area full of bike messengers and pizza delivery guys could benefit from the 30 minutes or less approach of a Jeff Bezos. At some point, it\u2019s possible to imagine going out to a baseball game or music festival on a warm summer day, pressing a button on your smartphone, and having a drone deliver a nice cold beer to your seat within minutes. In South Africa, for example, they already have beer drones. *[WSU]: Wayne State University So what other business models might profit from consumer drones? Imagine personal security drones buzzing around your home, keeping it safe while you\u2019re away on vacation and capable of interacting with police and fire department first-responders. There\u2019s also been talk of how drones could lead to massive new efficiencies in the agricultural sector by giving farmers and ranchers the ability to monitor vast areas. Oil and gas exploration teams could deploy drones to survey remote areas. Real estate agents could use them to create videos of new properties on the market. And, of course, Hollywood film directors could create new types of action shots using drones capable of recording video from unique angles. And you wouldn\u2019t even have to be a Hollywood director to take advantage of this last capability. What if, for example, you were to combine the GoPro video revolution (recently featured by Anderson Cooper on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in November) with the technological capabilities of a drone, such that you had a personal GoPro video drone following you around and doing your bidding when it wasn\u2019t otherwise filming your every move? That might sound insane, but that\u2019s the vision from former _Wired_ editor Chris Anderson, who recently landed $30 million in VC financing for his drones company, 3D Robotics, and has been at the forefront of advancing something he\u2019s calling an \u201cautonomous personal robot.\u201d As Anderson recently outlined in a cover story for _Wired_, the \u201cautonomous personal robot\u201d is essentially a \u201cpet bird\u201d that follows you around wherever you are. *[WSU]: Wayne State University And that\u2019s not all. Commercial drone technology is an exponential technology, meaning that we\u2019ll continue to see massive improvements in what they\u2019re capable of. They\u2019ll shrink in size and become more powerful with every passing year. Once the FAA rules on commercial drones in 2015, we\u2019ll likely see an explosion of commercial drone concepts, as those 25,000 DIY drone hobbyists in America are able to unlock their innovation in pursuit of new business ideas. Drones will no longer be an underground hobbyist activity. *[WSU]: Wayne State University In the end, that might just be the future that Jeff Bezos envisions \u2014 he may not really plan to fly all those Amazon octocopters, but he\u2019s laying the groundwork for innovation so that Amazon can benefit from all the size and scale advantages once operating a commercial drone fleet becomes economically feasible and legally possible.
