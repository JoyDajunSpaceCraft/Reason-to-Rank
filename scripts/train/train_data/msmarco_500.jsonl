They can also lead to night sweats and insomnia. Other Causes for Hot Flashes. When someone experiences hot flashes, a doctor can tell with a simple blood test if the problem is related to menopause or due to some other reason. 1  Menopause usually occurs in the 50s, so when someone much younger has hot flashes, physicians will often look for additional causes. Some of the most common ones include: 1  Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism, which causes an overabundance of thyroid hormone, can increase the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s metabolism and lead to hot flashes and sweating. 2  Food and drink, including spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol, can trigger hot flashes.", "Hot flash.

You may experience a feeling similar to a hot flash when your body temperature rises.", "What Is a Hot Flash? A hot flash is a quick feeling of heat and sometimes a red, flushed face and sweating. The exact cause of hot flashes is not known, but they may be related to changes in circulation. Hot flashes happen when the blood vessels near the skin's surface dilate to cool, making you break out in a sweat. Some women have a rapid heart rate or chills. Hot flashes with sweating can also happen at night. These are called night sweats and may make it harder to sleep. A hot flush is a hot flash plus redness in the face and neck. How Long Will I Have Hot Flashes? That depends. Some women have hot flashes for a very short time during menopause.
