Wearing a knee-length dress and a white cardigan, Haggard crossed the street. Leaning toward a passenger-side window, Haggard\u2019s shoulder-length hair grazed the neckline of the dress. Minutes later, the person in the vehicle struck out with a knife, stabbing Haggard in the neck. Haggard stumbled, bleeding in the street and later dying at a hospital in the Central California city of Fresno. LGBT activists say Haggard\u2019s brutal killing was the 11th so far this year of a transgender woman \u2014 and the second in just three days. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But as far as the Fresno Police Department is concerned, the 66-year-old victim is male \u2014 not female. The case has highlighted the challenges of investigating violent crimes against transgender people, who, in the early stages of transitioning, might keep their identities secret from even the closest people in their lives. They live in fear of being themselves, advocates say. And when they are victimized, law enforcement is often slow to acknowledge their true identities, leaving potential avenues of investigation untouched and also making it more difficult to track violence against transgender people. \u201cWe have a tremendous problem of under-reporting of hate crimes against trans people \u2014 and all hate crimes,\u201d said David Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT advocacy group. _[Girl Scouts choose transgender girls over $100,000 donation]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Fresno Police Department said it is investigating all leads to determine who committed the horrific crime, but there is \u201cno evidence\u201d that the victim was transgender or that Haggard was killed for that reason. \u201cWe have no information that this victim identified as transgender,\u201d Lt. Joe Gomez, a spokesman for the Fresno Police Department, told The Washington Post. \u201cAnd in fact, the information that we do have from people he lived with is that he did not.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not pertinent in the crime,\u201d Gomez added. Furthermore, Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer referred to the victim repeatedly as \u201cMr. Haggard\u201d in a press conference Saturday \u2014 a decision that has infuriated activists rallying to bring attention to the killing. \u201cShe was out \u2018test-driving\u2019 her female attire in the early morning, where she could be herself and not be bothered; I am convinced of that,\u201d said Karen Adell Scot, founder of TransCare, which provides aid to people transitioning in the Fresno area. \u201cShe was newly transitioning.\u201d _[8 critical facts about the state of transgender America\u200b]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The last time Jeff Haggard saw his cousin, it was about a year and a half ago, in a brief, chance meeting. He had no idea that his cousin might have been transitioning. \u201cHe seemed like the Kenton I\u2019ve always known since I was a kid,\u201d Jeff Haggard said. His cousin was always \u201ckind of a loner,\u201d who never married and had no children, Jeff Haggard said, noting that when he first read about his cousin\u2019s killing, it was in the local news. Gerald Haggard, Kenton Haggard\u2019s brother, confirmed to The Post that his only sibling had been killed. Kenton Haggard worked as a security guard for years until he retired recently \u2014 no longer able to keep up with the physical demands of the job, Gerald Haggard told The Post. A few months ago, neighbors at the apartment complex where Kenton Haggard lived called his brother, who lives about an hour away, to report that Kenton Haggard was \u201ccross-dressing and walking down the street,\u201d Gerald Haggard said. \u201cThese incidents were all in the day.\u201d \u201cI knew that he was cross-dressing,\u201d Gerald Haggard told The Post. \u201cWe never had a conversation about transgender or changing.\u201d In fact, they spoke last week, hours before Kenton Haggard was killed. But Gerald Haggard said the conversation centered on daily life and the subject of transitioning never came up. \u201cI was concerned for my brother, but for his whole situation as far as his financial health, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe least of my concerns had to do with the new cross-dressing. The new cross-dressing was not high on my list of worries or concerns.\u201d He added: \u201cIf he wanted to voluntarily talk about it, then that would have been fine. If he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, then it was his freedom to do what he wanted.\u201d _[Transgender in Maine: What life looks like for women who transitioned over age 60]_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The complexities of this case have also divided LGBT advocates, who express varying degrees of wariness about assuming a person\u2019s gender identity \u2014 one way or another. According to LGBT advocate Chris Jarvis, some in the trans community have suggested that if a man is dressed as a woman \u201cand it\u2019s not Halloween,\u201d they should be assumed to be trans. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true,\u201d said Jarvis, founder of Gay Central Valley, which operates the Fresno and Merced LGBT community centers. \u201cIt could be that this person was a cross-dresser and not trans. It\u2019s difficult to say that.\u201d \u201cWithout K.c. here to tell us, we may never know.\u201d Typically, LGBT activists prefer to identify someone based on the person\u2019s preferred gender pronoun. But Haggard\u2019s case has raised the complex question of what happens when a person is killed before that preference is clear to the people around them. According to Fresno Police, statements from relatives and roommates gave no indication that Haggard identified as a woman. That isn\u2019t uncommon for people newly transitioning, activists say. \u201cIf someone wants to come out as transgender, nine out of 10 times they lose their family,\u201d said Scot, the TransCare founder. \u201cMany will lose their jobs. Many will be shunned, ostracized, hated. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid. It\u2019s terrifying. We know who we are. The gender dysphoria drives us forwards. It\u2019s either transition or die.\u201d Despite the statements from family and friends, Haggard\u2019s attire that night \u2014 a dress, jewelry and a cardigan \u2014 is a clear sign that Haggard identified as a woman, Scot said. According to activists, there is also evidence online that Kenton Craig Haggard recently began using the name K.c. Haggard on Facebook. In one post on what appears to be Haggard\u2019s Facebook page, Haggard reviewed a local bar four months ago using that name: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cHey calling TG girls amber says we can hangout there. C U there K.c. Haggard,\u201d the message read. \u201c\u2018TG girls\u2019 is transgender girls, absolutely,\u201d Scot said. She added that somebody who works at the Fresno LGBT Community Center recalled seeing Haggard at group meetings for trans people in recent months. Police have said that based on the part of town where the killing occurred, along with the victim\u2019s dress, they believe Haggard might have been involved in prostitution, according to the Fresno Bee. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That suggestion has irked Scot, who said there is precious little evidence for police to make those assumptions either. \u201cThere\u2019s an assumption, with no evidence, that she was a sex worker,\u201d Scot said. \u201cThis is what we face as transgender people all the time. We face a bias against us by law enforcement, but we are assumed not to be transgender and yet we are assumed as sex workers. \u201cWhy would they assume one and not look at the evidence for another.\u201d Police have said that they are looking for a suspect who they believe is a Hispanic male in his late 30s who also hired a prostitute in the hours after the killing. Dyer, the Fresno police chief, said the FBI is assisting in the investigation. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico READ MORE: _Transgender in the military: A Pentagon in transition weighs its policy_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Meet Kristin Beck, a transgender former Navy SEAL running for Congress_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _For transgender teens and teachers, acceptance could be two words away_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Transgender at five_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "qid": 870, "docid": "6dd83d54823cdff44a962e61c11c8bd7", "score": 14.123200416564941}, {"content": "Title: Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students Content: The Trump administration on Wednesday revoked federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school restrooms that match their gender identity, taking a stand on a contentious issue that has become the central battle over LGBT rights. Officials with the federal Education and Justice departments notified the U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday that the administration is ordering the nation\u2019s schools to disregard memos the Obama administration issued during the past two years regarding transgender student rights. Those memos said that prohibiting transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity violates federal anti-discrimination laws. The two-page \u201cDear colleague\u201d letter from the Trump administration, which is set to go to the nation\u2019s public schools, does not offer any new guidance, instead saying that the earlier directive needed to be withdrawn because it lacked extensive legal analysis, did not go through a public vetting process, sowed confusion and drew legal challenges. The administration said that it would not rely on the prior interpretation of the law in the future. The departments wrote that the Trump administration wants to \u201cfurther and more completely consider the legal issues involved,\u201d and said that there must be \u201cdue regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\u201d Although it offered no clarity or direction to schools that have transgender students, the letter added that \u201cschools must ensure that all students, including LGBT students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment.\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that his department \u201chas a duty to enforce the law\u201d and criticized the Obama administration\u2019s guidance as lacking sufficient legal basis. Sessions wrote that the Department of Justice remains committed to the \u201cproper interpretation\u201d of the anti-discrimination law known as Title IX but said deference should be given to lawmakers and localities. \u201cCongress, state legislatures, and local governments are in a position to adopt appropriate policies or laws addressing this issue,\u201d Sessions said. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an issue \u201cbest solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find \u2014 and in many cases have found \u2014 solutions that protect all students.\u201d DeVos also gave assurances that the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights \u201cremains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools,\u201d and she noted that she considers \u201cprotecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America.\u201d The decision \u2014 delayed in part because DeVos and Sessions hit stalemates regarding timing and specific language \u2014 drew immediate condemnation from gay and transgender rights advocates, who accused President Trump of violating past promises to support gay and transgender protections. Advocates said the withdrawal of the federal guidance will create another layer of confusion for schools and will make transgender students, who are already vulnerable, more so. \u201cAttacking our children . . . is no way to say you support and respect LGBTQ people,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Others said the practical effect on the nation\u2019s schools would be muted, in part because a federal judge already had blocked the Obama guidance in response to a lawsuit from 13 states that argued it violated states\u2019 rights. And it is possible the U.S. Supreme Court could settle the matter soon, as it plans to consider a Virginia case involving a transgender teenager who was barred from using the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school. The Trump administration\u2019s move drew cheers from social conservatives who oppose the idea that a student can identify as a gender that differs from their anatomy at birth. Vicki Wilson, the mother of a child at Fremd High School in Palatine, Ill., said she sympathizes with children who have \u201cdifficult personal issues\u201d to deal with, but thinks that \u201cyoung men shouldn\u2019t be permitted to deal with those issues in an intimate setting like a locker room with young women.\u201d School district officials in Palatine, bowing to federal pressure, allowed a transgender girl to change in the girls\u2019 locker room at her school. \u201cNo school should impose a policy like this against the will of so many parents,\u201d Wilson said during a news conference organized by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal organization. The administration\u2019s letter was the source of some disagreement between the two issuing departments, with Sessions eager to rescind the Obama administration\u2019s guidance as court proceedings in related cases approached, and DeVos keen to leave it in place. Unlike Arne Duncan, Obama\u2019s education secretary for seven years, DeVos does not have a close personal relationship with the president she serves; she also lacks the experience and political capital Sessions garnered as a Republican senator. Sessions is widely known to oppose expanding gay and transgender rights, and DeVos\u2019s friends say she personally supports those rights. The new letter is sure to ignite another firestorm for DeVos, who is fresh off her contentious nomination fight and has drawn protests from parents and teachers who believe she is unqualified for the job. The letter also puts Trump squarely in the middle of the civil rights debate: Despite a flurry of activity in the early weeks of his presidency, Trump had not previously waded into the issue of gay and transgender rights. Trump declined to sign an executive order last month that would have dramatically expanded the rights of people, businesses and organizations of faith to opt out of laws or activities that violate their religion, such as same-sex wedding ceremonies. Many took it as a sign that he would take a more liberal approach on gay issues than his Republican cohorts. But in an interview with The Washington Post last year, then-candidate Donald Trump had indicated he would rescind the guidance based on the belief that it was a matter best left up to the states. In the daily news briefing Wednesday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer played down the reports of disagreement within the administration \u2014 saying the debate came down to timing and some specific wording \u2014 and reiterated the states\u2019 rights argument. \u201cThe president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he\u2019s a firm believer in states\u2019 rights,\u201d Spicer said. The Obama administration\u2019s guidance was based on the position that barring students from bathrooms that match their gender identities is a violation of Title IX because it amounts to sex discrimination. Many advocates contend the guidance merely formalized what courts have increasingly recognized: That discrimination against gay and transgender people is a form of sex discrimination because it is rooted in stereotypes about men and women. As a result, they believe transgender people already have the right under Title IX to use their preferred bathroom. The new letter scrambles the calculus for a number of lawsuits working their way through the courts, particularly the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender Virginia teen who sued his school board for barring him from the boys\u2019 restroom. The case is scheduled for oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court next month. A lower court cited the Obama administration\u2019s position on transgender student rights in siding with Grimm. Grimm said he was disheartened that the Trump administration is withdrawing the guidance. The Gloucester, Va., school board continued to bar him from the boys\u2019 bathroom even after the Obama guidance was issued, but Grimm said the directive was \u201cincredibly empowering.\u201d \u201cIt certainly bolstered hope that the future for transgender students was looking up in a way that it hadn\u2019t been previously,\u201d Grimm said. Amber Briggle, the mother of a 9-year-old transgender boy in Denton, Tex., said she views the Trump administration\u2019s position as a temporary setback and hopes that the Supreme Court will affirm transgender students\u2019 rights. But the withdrawal of the Obama directive is a blow, she said, because the guidance made her feel that Washington cared about children like hers and understood the support they need. \u201cI just don\u2019t think my family matters to the Trump administration,\u201d she said. Catherine Lhamon, who headed the Obama Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, said in a sworn declaration that the administration developed the guidance after receiving discrimination complaints from parents of transgender children and questions from teachers and administrators who were having to develop policies with regard to their transgender students. In 2011, the Education Department received two complaints of discrimination against transgender students in schools. By 2016, that number had leapt to 84, according to the declaration filed in federal court. In a kindergarten class where students line up by gender to go to the bathroom, \u201ca student has to decide which line to get into, and the teacher has to decide which line to accept that student into, and both of them have to field questions from other students in the class,\u201d Lhamon said in an interview. \u201cAny of those choices raises potential for discrimination and potential for harm that all of the students and teachers in a school have to navigate. It\u2019s not an abstraction for the people who live it every day.\u201d Lhamon said the withdrawal of the guidance and the notion that the federal government needs more time to consider the issue of transgender accommodations creates chaos in schools and sends a damaging message to children. Without federal guidance, schools are likely to look to their state governments for clarity, said Francisco Negron Jr., chief counsel for the National School Boards Association. That could open up battles across the country similar to one last year in North Carolina, when the legislature voted to require people in public buildings to use the restrooms that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates. Fifteen states have explicit protections for transgender students, according to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group; lawmakers in several other states are working to restrict bathroom access for transgender students. The American Civil Liberties Union, which tracks the legislation, said legislators in 14 states filed 20 bills that could lead to restroom restrictions for transgender people, with some proposing that states penalize schools that violate those restrictions. So far, five of those bills have failed. Many school districts held off on writing restroom policies as they waited for the outcome of the Grimm case. Among them was Fairfax County, Va., one of the largest districts in the nation, which was preparing to draft regulations on restroom access for transgender students to reflect its nondiscrimination policy. Elizabeth Schultz, a Fairfax County School Board member who opposes expanding the protections, said she hopes the new Trump administration action will lead the district to abandon its efforts. If the threat of revoking federal funds \u201cis no longer wielded against our local authority, there\u2019s no precipitating reason to continue,\u201d she said. **Read more:** Obama administration directs schools to accommodate transgender students Gavin Grimm just wanted to use the bathroom.

Kennedy picked his younger brother to be attorney general. President Trump might have picked the next closest thing. Jeff Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump at a time when few Republican lawmakers supported the candidate. His early and fierce loyalty \u2014 and his ability to translate Trump\u2019s nationalist instincts into policy \u2014 helped him forge a bond with the president, and he now enjoys access whenever he wants it, a privilege that few get, an official said. Two of Sessions\u2019s former Senate advisers \u2014 Stephen Miller and Rick Dearborn \u2014 hold key White House roles, and one official said Sessions still talks to them regularly. The attorney general also is friendly with Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s chief strategist and a powerful player in the administration who promoted Sessions for years on the Breitbart website. On Thursday, not long before Sessions recused himself from any investigations related to the Trump campaign, the president proclaimed that he had \u201ctotal\u201d confidence in his attorney general. Later, Trump issued a statement calling Sessions \u201can honest man\u201d who \u201cdid not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\u201d Trump also derided the \u201cwhole narrative\u201d as \u201ca way of face saving for Democrats losing an election that everyone thought they were supposed to win,\u201d and he pointed \u2014 as he has in the past \u2014 to leaks of classified information as the \u201creal story.\u201d \u201cIt is a total witch hunt!\u201d Trump said. The remarks \u2014 which came as pressure mounted for Sessions to step aside from any investigations of Trump associates and Russia, or to resign altogether \u2014 demonstrate the high standing Sessions has in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, and the critical role he will play in carrying out the president\u2019s vision. Already, the administration has moved swiftly to implement policies that correspond with the worldview shared by Trump and Sessions. In his inaugural address, Trump spoke of rising crime and vowed to end the \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d His attorney general, in his first speech, laid out how he plans to do that: a task force, a crackdown on drugs and an increased respect for police, who he suggested might see less aggressive scrutiny than they did under his predecessor. \u201cI do not believe that this pop in crime \u2014 this increase in crime \u2014 is necessarily an aberration, a one-time blip,\u201d Sessions told the National Association of Attorneys General. On immigration, an issue that has consumed much of Sessions\u2019s career, the ideological influence in Trump\u2019s policies is vivid and clear, and his Justice Department will be tasked with implementing \u2014 and defending \u2014 the president\u2019s plans. In the Senate, Sessions was a crusader for a hard-line stance on immigration, arguing that even legal immigration to the United States should be moderated. Trump has essentially implemented Sessions\u2019s ideas by executive action \u2014 calling for the hiring of more Customs and Border Protection agents, expanding the pool of those who are prioritized for removal, and temporarily barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. That last order has since been frozen by the courts, and Sessions\u2019s Justice Department, which has forcefully defended it, has been involved in crafting a new one. Sessions also has taken steps to undo the previous Justice Department\u2019s policy toward transgender children, changed its position on a Texas voting rights law the department had been fighting for years and reversed the previous administration\u2019s policy on the use of private prisons. His views on those topics match those of the president, who has cast himself a champion of private industry and alleged, without evidence, that massive voter fraud affected the election. During an internal White House debate over the transgender policy, Trump sided with Sessions over Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, according to the New York Times. The attorney general holds a unique role in any presidential Cabinet \u2014 requiring the person in the job to implement the president\u2019s policy goals on one hand, while faithfully enforcing laws on the other. Sessions is not the first attorney general to enjoy a close relationship with the president. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., whose worldview was similar to President Barack Obama\u2019s, enjoyed status as the former president\u2019s favorite Cabinet member. Like Sessions, Holder came to know Obama before he ran for office and then joined him as a close adviser on the campaign trail. On issues such as same-sex marriage and the reform of a criminal justice system, which they both saw as deeply unfair to young black men, the two worked hand in hand as Holder executed policies that they both supported. Sessions and Trump met in 2005, when Sessions invited him to Washington to testify at a Senate subcommittee hearing about his criticism of a U.N. project. Sessions was taken with the billionaire developer and later said it was the best congressional testimony he had ever heard. Two years ago, in June 2015, Trump and Sessions held a conference call on immigration policy. After that, Trump began trying to persuade Sessions to endorse him for president, and by January 2016 had, in essence, lent his top aide, Miller, to the Trump campaign. In February of last year at a rally in Alabama, Trump told the crowd that Sessions supported him, and Sessions donned a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat as he praised Trump, months after Sessions teased the possibility at a summer rally in Mobile. Observers on the campaign trail noted how different the two seemed. Trump is from the North, Sessions from the South. Trump is brash, while Sessions is soft-spoken. Sessions has been in politics for nearly 20 years; Trump is a businessman who had never before held elected office. But they bonded over their views on issues like immigration and law and order, with Trump\u2019s view of those issues influenced by his father, Fred, and his early years in business in New York, and how he saw global competition threaten the U.S. economy. Miller, a former Sessions aide, is the author of many of Trump\u2019s executive orders, and Dearborn, Sessions\u2019s longtime chief of staff, works to turn Trump\u2019s goals into law. In Trump\u2019s orbit, of course, support can evaporate in an instant, and it is hard to assess who is truly in power \u2014 aside from Trump himself. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said national security adviser Michael Flynn had the \u201cfull confidence\u201d of the president, and on the same day, Flynn resigned amid revelations that he had misled Vice President Pence about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Yet Sessions so far has largely weathered the storm. He confirmed Thursday that he met twice with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, a fact he had omitted at his Senate confirmation hearing to become attorney general. At that hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign, and said, \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d Sessions said at a Justice Department news conference Thursday that he would provide the Judiciary Committee a written explanation for his testimony in the next day or two, while still insisting it was \u201chonest and correct as I understood it at the time.\u201d His explanation is that he was flustered by Franken\u2019s question \u2014 which referenced a breaking news story about contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. \u201cIt struck me very hard, and that\u2019s what I focused my answer on,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times. That would be the ambassador.\u201d Sessions said he would now recuse himself from any investigations having to do with the Trump campaign and insisted he had been talking with Justice Department ethics officials about doing so even before news broke of his meetings with Kislyak. Not long before, Trump himself had said he did not believe Sessions needed to do so. White House press secretary Sean Spicer had also said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to recuse himself\u201d and said those criticizing Sessions were \u201cchoosing to play partisan politics.\u201d Sessions said he told the White House counsel what he planned to do Thursday afternoon, but they perhaps didn\u2019t know or understand the rules as he did. \u201cI should not be involved investigating a campaign I had a role in,\u201d Sessions said.", "qid": 870, "docid": "53aa4af8-ff59-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f", "score": 13.870599746704102}, {"content": "Title: Hill Democrats slam Trump\u2019s military transgender ban, while GOP is caught by surprise Content: Lawmakers in both parties slammed President Trump\u2019s decision on Wednesday to bar transgender Americans from serving in the military, while many of his allies on Capitol Hill remained largely perplexed or silent. The president\u2019s decision, announced in a series of tweets, is yet another move that confused and divided elements of his party at a time when it is already roiled by disagreements over the future of a proposed health-care overhaul and of embattled Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has faced a barrage of criticism from Trump in recent days. Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.), a former Army officer, said \u201cit throws us off\u201d when Trump issues surprise tweets that distract from other GOP priorities. \u201cBased on what we\u2019re doing in here this week, I don\u2019t know what the connection is,\u201d he said. Capitol Hill\u2019s most prominent Republican voice on national security matters, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), also criticized Trump\u2019s announcement, calling it \u201cunclear\u201d and \u201cyet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter.\u201d McCain added, \u201cThere is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train, and deploy to leave the military \u2014 regardless of their gender identity.\u201d He said there should be no change in policy until the Pentagon completes an ongoing review of the issue. Other conservative senators offered criticism of the move. A spokeswoman for Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), an Army veteran and member of the Armed Services Committee, said that the senator believes \u201cAmericans who are qualified and can meet the standards to serve in the military should be afforded that opportunity,\u201d though the military should not fund gender-reassignment surgery. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), a Trump ally on most issues, said he wanted \u201cmore information and clarity\u201d on Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be discriminating against anyone,\u201d he said, adding that transgender people \u201cdeserve the best we can do for them.\u201d And Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), a senior member of an Appropriations subcommittee that sets Pentagon spending levels, said he expected Congress to call hearings exploring Trump\u2019s policy change. \u201cYou ought to treat everybody fairly and give everybody a chance to serve,\u201d he told CNN. Most Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, remained mum in the hours immediately after the announcement Wednesday. A House Republican aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly about internal matters, said that while GOP leaders were aware of a White House review of the issue of transgender service members, they were not given heads-up about the announcement and that it was \u201cway beyond what we expected.\u201d One Republican lawmaker who offered early support for the policy change on social media was Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who recently offered an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that would have blocked the Pentagon from offering gender transition therapies to active-duty service members. \u201cPleased to hear that @realDonaldTrump shares my readiness and cost concerns, & will be changing this costly and damaging policy,\u201d she said on Twitter. But a GOP colleague, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (Fla.), who has a transgender son, weighed in against the policy: \u201cNo American, no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be prohibited from honor + privilege of serving our nation.\u201d Trump\u2019s announcement comes two weeks after the House rejected Hartzler\u2019s amendment in a closely watched vote. Twenty-four Republicans joined all 190 Democrats voting to reject the measure. But the issue has remained a pet cause for House conservatives who believe the federal government should not be funding gender reassignments. Conservatives have offered several amendments to a pending appropriations bill funding the military that would target transgender service members. But those amendments, which could come up for a vote Thursday, would not exclude them from serving entirely. During the debate on the initial amendment, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee who also served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, argued for the therapy restriction but explicitly stopped short of calling for an overall ban. \u201cWe\u2019re not stopping transgender people from joining,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying taxpayers in this country right now are not going to foot the bill for it.\u201d The defense policy bill has yet to move through the Senate, though Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has indicated that could happen in the coming weeks. McCain, who is still determining how to treat an aggressive form of brain cancer, is poised to lead floor debate on the legislation. Opponents of Trump\u2019s policy could use the legislation to amend the bill to overturn it. A handful of Democrats, including Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), said they were preparing legislation to do so. Gillibrand, who has used her perch on the Senate Armed Services Committee to push for greater protections for women in uniform, said Wednesday that she would pursue legislation to \u201coverturn this discriminatory decision.\u201d The defense bill, always seen as one of the few must-pass bills of the year, is often used as a way to launch proxy battles in the decades-long culture wars that pit social conservatives against progressives. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle often introduce legislation to restrict or expand abortion protections at military medical installations, to enact stricter rules against sexual harassment or rape in the ranks, or in more recent years, to restrict or roll back protections for transgender troops. The last time the annual defense bill was used to make a significant change in social policy was 2010, when lawmakers voted to roll back the Clinton-era \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d rule that banned gay men and lesbians from openly serving in uniform. But transgender service was left in flux, in part because its fate has been dictated by internal Pentagon medical policy, not law. If Trump\u2019s tweets signal a change in policy, then \u201cthis is a president hell-bent determined to wreak havoc in the ranks \u2014 the very thing he said he didn\u2019t want to do he\u2019s proposed doing,\u201d said Aubrey Sarvis, a private attorney and gay rights advocate who used to lead Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, the group that pushed to end the gay troop ban. \u201cIf he seeks to do this as commander in chief by ordering his subordinates to act on this, the Defense Department is going to be faced with a barrage of lawsuits.\u201d \u201cThis is a wake up call and defining moment for the LGBT community. We have to rise up and oppose this president,\u201d Sarvis added. The seven openly gay members of Congress quickly denounced the change. Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), who is also running for Colorado governor, said, \u201cTrump makes our military weaker by arbitrarily kicking out high-performing soldiers based solely on gender identity.\u201d Other Democrats flooded social media and email inboxes with statements objecting to the change. Rep. Adam Smith (Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201can unwarranted and disgraceful attack on men and women who have been bravely serving their country.\u201d \u201cThese service members are defending the United States around the world as we speak, and they have long done so with distinction,\u201d he said. \u201cTo prevent transgender people from joining the military and to push out those who have devoted their lives to this country would be ugly and discriminatory in the extreme.\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) noted that Trump made his announcement on the 69th anniversary of President Harry Truman\u2019s executive order desegregating the military, adding that the president \u201chas chosen this day to unleash a vile and hateful agenda that will blindside thousands of patriotic Americans.\u201d \u201cTransgender Americans are serving honorably in our military,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.). \u201cWe stand with these patriots.\u201d Several Democratic military veterans also lambasted Trump\u2019s decision. Rep. Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), a Marine veteran of the Iraq War, accused Trump of \u201cusing fear of Trans community to score political points.\u201d \u201cBanning any qualified person from serving their country, because of who they are is both discriminatory and bad national security policy,\u201d he tweeted. And Rep. Anthony G. Brown (Md.), a retired Army Reserve colonel, called it \u201ca dark day for our Armed Forces and our nation.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s rationale harkens back to a more ignorant and intolerant time, where words like \u2018disruption\u2019 and \u2018not a social experiment\u2019 were used to keep women, African Americans and gays and lesbians from fully participating in our military services,\u201d he said.", "qid": 870, "docid": "288bf3ae-7212-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304", "score": 13.4266996383667}, {"content": "Title: GOP lawmakers openly defy president as frustration mounts Content: They passed legislation to stop him from lifting sanctions on Russia. They recoiled at his snap decision to ban transgender Americans from the military. And they warned him in no uncertain terms not to fire the attorney general or the special counsel investigating the president and his aides. Republican lawmakers have openly defied President Trump in meaningful ways this week amid growing frustration on Capitol Hill with his surprise tweets, erratic behavior and willingness to trample on governing norms. But at the same time, they\u2019ve worked to advance legislation they want him to sign. In the latest signs of a backlash, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he would not hold hearings on a replacement if Trump dismissed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Thursday he would pursue legislation that would prevent Trump from summarily firing special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \u201cSome of the suggestions that the president is making go way beyond what\u2019s acceptable in a rule-of-law nation,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis is not draining the swamp. What he\u2019s interjecting is turning democracy upside down.\u201d Some of the defiance came from already outspoken Trump critics such as Graham and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who rebuked the president from the Senate floor Thursday. \u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of making a recess appointment to push out the attorney general, forget about it,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cThe presidency isn\u2019t a bull, and this country isn\u2019t a china shop.\u201d But some generally pro-Trump lawmakers emerged Wednesday as critics of the unexpected transgender ban, which the president announced in a series of morning tweets with no notice to key figures on Capitol Hill who might normally be called upon to defend his actions. Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) issued statements Wednesday saying Trump went too far in banning all transgender service members. On Thursday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) refused to back the ban, saying he would await a Defense Department review of the issue despite Trump\u2019s clear wishes. \u201cI look forward to seeing what they actually produce,\u201d Ryan said. On the sanctions issue, the Senate, on a 98-to-2 vote on Thursday, cleared legislation targeting Russia, Iran and North Korea that the Trump administration had sought to water down \u2014 particularly a provision that would require Trump to seek congressional approval before lifting sanctions against Russia. The bill had passed the House earlier this week on a 419-to-3 vote. Several lawmakers said that if Trump vetoes the measure, Congress was prepared to override it. \u201cNo president likes Congress to tie their hands,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \u201cThis is a very unique and particular case at a key moment. . . . If the president vetoes it, as is his right, there will be a debate, but I believe it will be overridden.\u201d Despite the brush backs, Republican lawmakers are continuing to act on key parts of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. Those items, however, face major hurdles. The House on Thursday cleared a package of spending bills that boost defense spending and earmark $1.6 billion to build 74 miles of border fencing \u2014 making good on Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d to separate the United States and Mexico. The bill, however, breaks existing budget caps. Any final spending agreement will have to be negotiated later in the year with Democrats, who have so far refused to support any wall funding. The Senate, meanwhile, continued working haltingly toward passage of a health-care bill that swallowed much of the attention and energy on Capitol Hill. On Thursday evening, a group of senators that included Graham and John McCain (R-Ariz.) faced television cameras inside the Capitol to make an unusual declaration: They would vote for the health-care bill in the Senate only if they were assured by House Republican leaders that they would not in turn pass it into law. The senators\u2019 hope was to convene a conference committee, an open-ended negotiation that could keep the internal battle over replacing the Affordable Care Act alive for months. The effort would potentially distract from other contentious issues, such as a tax overhaul. That tax initiative took a modest step forward Thursday when key White House officials and congressional leaders issued a joint statement of principles for the overhaul \u2014 one that discarded a controversial tax on corporate imports favored by Ryan. The House, however, has yet to pass a 2018 budget, a key initial step Republicans are counting on to be able to pass the tax overhaul without involving Democrats. House GOP aides indicated Friday that the matter would be left until September, after a planned five-week recess. Lawmakers in September will have to confront a possible government shutdown and federal default. The most palpable frustration on Capitol Hill, however, tends not to concern health care or tax reform or appropriations, but rather Trump\u2019s chaotic White House and his Twitter musings. Recent weeks have seen lawmakers who have brushed aside Trump\u2019s antics by calling him \u201crefreshing\u201d and \u201cunconventional\u201d more willing to voice their concerns. After the transgender tweetstorm Wednesday, Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.) expressed frustration that Trump\u2019s tweets come out of nowhere, leaving GOP lawmakers out of step with the president. \u201cWhen we do stuff in here that we\u2019re trying to message, and there\u2019s a tweet that comes out that\u2019s different than that, it throws us off,\u201d he said. \u201cBased on what we\u2019re doing in here this week, I don\u2019t know what the connection is.\u201d Especially alarming to congressional Republicans are Trump\u2019s recent tweets about Sessions and Mueller \u2014 such as a Saturday tweet asking why the two are not investigating alleged \u201ccrimes\u201d by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and by former FBI director James B. Comey. A subsequent tweet Tuesday accused Sessions of taking \u201ca VERY weak position\u201d on investigating Clinton and leakers of intelligence secrets. Sessions has seen an outpouring of support this week from his former colleagues in the Senate, where he served for two decades. \u201cI think the president has to keep in mind a couple of things,\u201d Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said Thursday. \u201cJeff Sessions, like all Cabinet members, works for the United States of America. They don\u2019t work for the president; they work for the people. . . . The president\u2019s a smart man, and he ought to know that.\u201d Meanwhile, key lawmakers have voiced confidence in Mueller. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the president\u2019s interest that he stays where he is and continues and does his job,\u201d Ryan said Thursday. Graham said Thursday that a move against Mueller would represent \u201cthe beginning of the end of the Trump presidency.\u201d His bill, which he said he is drafting in conjunction with Democratic colleagues, would require a federal judge to review any move to dismiss a special counsel. Fellow Republicans offered support for the move. \u201cI hope that it doesn\u2019t become needed,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who is pursuing his own investigation of Trump as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Content: Threats, vandalism and recent shootings across the country have sparked outrage and have been quickly decried as hate crimes: The fatal stabbing of a homeless black man in New York City on Monday by a white Maryland man who police said traveled to the city to act on his long- harbored hatred of black men. The killing in Kansas of a man from India and the wounding of another. Bomb threats against Jewish schools nationwide and the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. The wounding of a Sikh man near Seattle. But condemning a repugnant act as a hate crime is far easier than making that charge stick in court, and prosecutions could be even less frequent if the Justice Department shifts its approach **** under a new attorney general who has indicated that states should take the lead. Some states do not have hate crime laws. The majority that do don\u2019t agree on what acts qualify. And atop conflicting and cumbersome language, a court ruling in a case involving Amish beard-cutting has raised hurdles to prosecutions even higher. Winning a conviction means proving that a person was motivated, for instance, by the victim\u2019s religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation. Yet arrests in a spate of bomb threats called in to Jewish schools and centers nationwide show how hard it can be to pin down motivation. Police say an Israeli teen arrested Thursday was behind the bulk of the threats, his motives unclear. Several earlier threats were made by a man trying to harass his girlfriend, according to law enforcement. Sometimes motivation is obvious, sometimes not, said Steven M. Dettelbach, a former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio who has prosecuted hate crimes. \u201cIt\u2019s an additional burden\u201d in a case, he said, \u201cbut it can be done.\u201d Federal hate crime charges generally carry stiffer penalties than state statutes, which is one reason they are used. But as important, prosecutors said, is that a federal presence makes a broad public statement that the crime is different in its intent and impact, extending well beyond an individual victim to strike at an entire community. Treating a hate crime in the same way as other crimes \u201cbelittles and minimizes it,\u201d said Dettelbach, who prosecuted the Amish case. Federal prosecutors long have been the backstop for state officials when it comes to bringing hate crime cases. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions opposed expanding federal hate crime protections as a U.S. senator and has signaled his preference for having states be the spearhead \u2014 a stance that could have significant impact, given the patchwork of laws. During the Obama administration, federal prosecutors filed a succession of hate crime cases. One was against Dylann Roof, who was sentenced to death in January for killing nine black parishioners in a church in Charleston, S.C. A conviction late last year in the murder of a transgender woman in Mississippi was the first to rely on federal protections based on a victim\u2019s gender identity. Some advocates and academics who track hate crimes say they are concerned that the Trump administration will intervene less, even as their organizations record a rapid rise in threats and attacks, particularly against Muslims. Reported hate crimes against Muslims surged in 2015 by nearly 67 percent at 257 incidents, according to FBI statistics released in November. A new report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino shows an overall increase of 13 percent in hate crimes reported in 2016 with 1,812 incidents, according to data collected from 15 U.S. cities and New York state. At Sessions\u2019s confirmation hearing in January, Democrats pressed him about his vote against the 2009 hate crimes law that created protections for people targeted because of sexual orientation and gender identity. Hate crimes, Sessions said, are being \u201cprosecuted effectively in state courts where they would normally be expected to be prosecuted.\u201d \u201cWe are extraordinarily concerned that there will be a significant cut in prosecutions, training, mediation, research and data collection initiatives,\u201d at the federal level, said Brian Levin director of the center in San Bernardino. Most hate crime cases are handled at the state and local level, with federal prosecutors deferring to local law enforcement. Five states \u2014 South Carolina, Georgia, Wyoming, Indiana and Arkansas \u2014 have no hate crime laws. Others, including the District of Columbia and Kansas, leave it to judges to decide whether to impose stiffer penalties for hate crimes at sentencing. Most federal prosecutions of crimes involving race, religion or gender require sign-off from the attorney general or a hand-picked representative. Thomas Wheeler, who was general counsel to Vice President Pence when Pence was Indiana governor, has been designated by Sessions as the acting assistant attorney general overseeing civil rights cases. After the bomb threats reported by Jewish schools and community centers in at least 33 states and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, all 100 senators on March 7 signed a letter urging \u201cswift action\u201d including \u201cinvestigating and prosecuting those making these threats.\u201d A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the letter, which was addressed to Sessions, FBI Director James B. Comey and Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Beyond prosecutions, the Obama-era Justice Department began mandatory bias training for more than 28,000 employees, formed hate crime task forces through U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices and provided grants to local organizations working to prevent hate-motivated violence. \u201cThat\u2019s the level of involvement that we\u2019re hoping and pressing for,\u201d said Michael Lieberman, Washington counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, one of the groups that pushed for passage of the federal 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The challenge in bringing federal hate crime cases has much to do with how the laws are written. A homophobic slur scrawled on the side of a gay club, for instance, is more difficult to charge as a hate crime than the vandalism of a church, synagogue or mosque because religious institutions have special protections as places of worship under federal law. A 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in the Amish beard-cutting case added another element to the calculations on when to move federally, prosecutors say. The ruling came in the 2012 convictions of more than a dozen members of a breakaway Amish sect in Ohio who cut off the beards of other Amish who had criticized their leader in what prosecutors said was an attempt to punish and humiliate the victims. The appeals court decision overturned the hate crimes convictions, saying the instructions given to jurors had been too broad. For the attacks to have been hate crimes, the court said, the religion of the victims had to be the prime motivation behind an attack, not just a \u201csignificant factor,\u201d as jurors had been told. On Feb. 23, the day after the fatal shooting in Kansas of an Indian engineer by a white man who witnesses said had shouted, \u201cGet out of my country,\u201d the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for state and federal hate crime charges to send a \u201cstrong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated.\u201d In Kansas, Johnson County District Attorney Stephen M. Howe has worked closely since then with federal agents who are investigating the shooting as a hate crime. Howe said, however, that federal hate crime charges may not be necessary as a means to enhance penalties when a suspect can face a death sentence for a killing in state court. \u201cWe\u2019re more nimble than the federal government. We can move a lot quicker,\u201d he said. But federal prosecutors have at times decided \u201cit is uniquely imperative for the federal government to send a strong and clear message against particularly vicious acts of hate that terrorize vulnerable communities and reverberate nationally,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the former head of the civil rights division in Obama\u2019s Justice Department. To underscore a broader statement about tolerance, the division pursued hate crimes even when local authorities had filed charges with similar penalties, especially when states \u201cdo not have robust hate crimes laws on the books or have weak enforcement,\u201d Gupta said. In South Carolina, which has no hate crime statute, the local district attorney had already charged Roof with capital murder, making him eligible for the death penalty, before the Justice Department also decided to act. In another recent case, Joshua Brandon Vallum already had been convicted on state murder charges in coastal Mississippi when federal investigators got involved at the urging of the local district attorney. Mississippi does not have a hate crimes statute that protects people from bias crimes based on gender identity. Vallum pleaded guilty in the federal case to the brutal 2015 murder of Mercedes Williamson, a transgender woman he had dated in a relationship he tried to hide. Tony Lawrence, the district attorney, said that the joint investigation yielded critical cellphone evidence and that the separate federal prosecution made clear that \u201cwhatever life Mercedes chose to live, she had a right to live it.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "15b8b454-08e7-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1", "score": 12.446999549865723}, {"content": "Title: Democrats fear that Trump has barred key federal workers from speaking to them Content: Democrats in Congress are accusing the Trump administration of ordering officials in federal departments and agencies to withhold information they need to carry out their duties, such as preparing for committee hearings. Party leaders say officials have routinely provided documents and detailed explanations of programs in the past, but now at least two ranking Democrats on congressional committees say their staff members were told directly by workers in agencies that they could no longer speak with them. The issue started in January and grew into such a concern that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) to track Democrats\u2019 correspondence to the executive branch that have gotten no response. So far, Sarbanes said, there are more than 100 cases from the House. \u201cHouse Democrats have sent more than 100 letters to the Trump administration seeking answers to urgent questions \u2026 and received no response,\u201d said Ashley Etienne, a spokeswoman for Pelosi\u2019s office. \u201cIf there is a concerted effort by the Trump administration not to respond to House Democrats \u2026 we will take appropriate action to address it.\u201d Although responding to letters from lawmakers in the opposition party is a common courtesy practiced by previous administrations, they don\u2019t always respond to every one. Each of the letters Sarbanes shared with The Post were written in March, and some appeared to require time for an adequate response. A few of the letters seemed political in nature, such as a March 2 letter from Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, questioning Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s communications with the Russian ambassador to the United States and calling on Sessions to resign. But most sought answers or action seemingly on behalf of constituents. Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) asked the administration on March 7 to maintain a $9 billion fund to fight opioid and prescription drug abuse in the United States. Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) asked Sessions to investigate the slayings of transgender women around the country as hate crimes. Rep. Annie McLane Kuster (D-N.H.) asked the Secretary of Defense James Mattis for information on reports that up to 30,000 Marines were under investigation for sharing and commenting on obscene photos of female Marines. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) and other Democrats in California\u2019s congressional delegation called on President Trump to declare a major disaster in the state after storms caused mudslides and overflowing reservoirs. Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), the ranking minority member on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, released an angry statement after meeting with officials at the General Services Administration in March. Carper wanted to know whether the use of public land by a Trump hotel in Washington financially benefited the president. At the end of a list of complaints, Carper stated that \u201cI am even more disturbed by the explicit statements made by GSA officials during this briefing that, beginning on Jan. 20, 2017, the Trump administration changed GSA\u2019s long-standing practice of providing certain documents requested by minority members of Congress. \u201cDuring the briefing,\u201d Carper continued, \u201cagency personnel stated that its new practice only assures that such documents will be provided to the committee\u2019s chairman.\u201d Both congressional chambers and their committees are controlled by Republicans, putting Democrats at a disadvantage that did not exist during previous administrations. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said a similar thing happened when he asked his staff to gather information from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Department of Interior last month. Grijalva was stunned when his chief of staff informed him that the staffer tasked with retrieving the information from a congressional liaison office was turned away. Department of Interior spokeswoman Heather Swift denied that Fish and Wildlife workers have been silenced. \u201cThere is no gag order,\u201d Swift wrote in an email last week. \u201cThe office of congressional and legislative affairs for both Interior and Fish and Wildlife has been in regular contact with both the majority and minority staff. They have supplied information for a number of requests, and Interior officials have consistently testified at hearings, including yesterday.\u201d Grijalva\u2019s office responded that the \u201ccontact\u201d Swift mentioned was personnel who \u201ctold us directly they have been order by the Office of the Secretary not to answer our questions about hearings at which administration witnesses are not present, and have refused to answer \u2026 questions.\u201d Without guidance from Fish and Wildlife, Democrats on a Natural Resources subcommittee said they were powerless to refute claims from witnesses called by Republicans who said the Endangered Species Acts cost projects millions of dollars as a result of delays. \u201cNearly 100,000 projects had to undergo time-consuming and expensive consultation even though none of them would likely jeopardize a listed species or its habitat,\u201d said Jonathan Wood, a staff attorney for the Pacific Legal Foundation. \u201cIn many cases, project approval would improve conditions for a threatened species while also bringing much needed economic development to rural America,\u201d said Doug Stiles, general manager of the Hecla Mining Company of Idaho. The statement, emailed by committee spokeswoman Molly Block, didn\u2019t list the species or areas that Wood and Stiles referenced. Unlike Fish and Wildlife experts, neither of the witnesses are scientists who have expertise in animal habitat and the impacts of development on species. With no experts present, Grijalva had no idea if their statements, which could influence future legislation, carried any truth. \u201cIs it true that the ESA is responsible for an economic downturn?\u201d Grijalva asked. \u201cOr are they scapegoating the ESA with the intent to limit it or make it toothless? What\u2019s the reality? This limits our ability to counter those points because you don\u2019t have an agency there that has the information this decision should be based on.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "fb45ca83ccf85cc062cd772b5323d1e4", "score": 12.431599617004395}, {"content": "Title: Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general is shadowed by race and history Content: Evelyn Turner is 80 now and a stroke survivor, but she can still recall sitting in a packed courthouse in Selma, Ala., facing a jury that could send her and her husband, an aide to Martin Luther King Jr., to prison for 150 years. The charges: mail fraud, voting more than once, and changing absentee ballots. The trial \u201cwas nerve-racking,\u201d recalled Turner, a mother of four. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to go to jail and leave my family.\u201d The U.S. attorney bringing the election fraud case was Jeff Sessions, today a four-term Republican senator from Alabama who is President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general. Back in 1985 when his prosecutors tried the Turners and a third activist, black Americans were gaining ground in elective offices across the South. Sessions\u2019s office charged the \u201cMarion Three\u201d \u2014 named after the Perry County town where the voter fraud allegedly took place \u2014 with tampering with absentee ballots cast by mostly elderly black voters to favor the activists\u2019 preferred candidates. Sessions\u2019s team lost the case. After deliberating for three hours, a jury of seven blacks and five whites found the defendants not guilty on all charges. The case and allegations of racial insensitivity figured prominently at a Senate hearing a year later at which Sessions\u2019s nomination to be a federal judge was defeated by a vote of the Judiciary Committee. Some 30 years later, he will appear before the same committee \u2014 of which he is now a senior member \u2014 as the nominee to become the next attorney general. After coming of age in the Deep South during the darkest days of the civil rights movement, Sessions has struggled to reconcile the racial politics of his region with the changing national discourse that lifted long-standing legal barriers for minorities. Sessions\u2019s long record in public life reveals a man who has hired African Americans for senior positions who speak highly of him, but who has been sharply criticized by civil rights groups for his positions on voting rights, same-sex marriage and gender equality. In 1986, for instance, when he testified before Congress, he called the Voting Rights Act \u201cintrusive\u201d but \u201cnecessary.\u201d Then in 2006, as a U.S. senator, he voted to renew the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. But seven years later, he said it was \u201cgood news . . . for the South\u201d when the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the law, which made it more difficult for the federal government to protect people from racial discrimination in voting. In Sessions, Trump found a man who holds deeply conservative views. He positions himself as a champion of the working class and expounds the same populist message that has come to dominate the Republican Party: a belief that the world is divided between working people and elitist \u201cmasters of the universe,\u201d and that illegal immigration poses an existential threat to the country. A diminutive, silver-haired figure, known among Senate colleagues for his courteous manner, Sessions was the first senator to endorse Trump, back in February. Sessions donned a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, stumped at rallies and tried to coax his colleagues onboard. Many of his positions mirror those of the president-elect, whether it is building a wall along the Mexican border or restricting immigration from Muslim countries that harbor terrorists. At a 2006 congressional hearing, Sessions said that an entire group of people wouldn\u2019t thrive in America. \u201cFundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to the United States is coming because they have a skill that would benefit us and would indicate their likely success in our society,\u201d he said. In 2009, he voted against a hate crimes bill named after Matthew Shepard, the gay Wyoming student murdered in 1998, that extended federal hate crime protections to people victimized because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. As state attorney general in 1995, he argued against a decision by the Alabama Circuit Court to order the state to remedy funding inequities between the poorest school districts, which were heavily black, and their wealthiest, which were predominantly white. He did so on the grounds that taxing and spending power lay with the legislature, not the courts. Sessions\u2019s staff members say that while Sessions was U.S. attorney, he filed a host of desegregation lawsuits in Alabama. But Sessions did not initiate the lawsuits. Rather, he signed off on paperwork from the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, supporting continuing federal desegregation lawsuits, which in some cases were decades old. He also signed off on election lawsuits brought by the Justice Department to convert countywide elections to multiple district elections so that African Americans could be represented on county commissions and schools boards. Supporters point out that as U.S. attorney, he worked hard on the successful 1983 prosecution of two Ku Klux Klan members for killing a black youth. Former FBI director Louis J. Freeh, in a letter of support to the Senate Judiciary Committee, also noted Sessions\u2019s \u201cfierce determination\u201d to solve two civil rights murders: the 1989 killings of a federal judge in Alabama and an official with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. And as a U.S. senator, Sessions co-sponsored legislation to honor civil rights activist Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal. But that doesn\u2019t convince Rose Sanders, a lawyer and civil rights activist in Selma whose husband was on the Marion Three defense team. Sanders is adamant: \u201cHe is racist to the core.\u201d In sharp contrast, former deputy attorney general Larry Thompson, who is African American, considers Sessions a good friend of more than 30 years. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been an African American man for 71 years,\u201d said Thompson, who served in the George W. Bush administration. \u201cI think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He\u2019s a good person, a decent person.\u201d Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, 70, is a third-generation Alabamian born in Selma. He was raised in a tiny town called Hybart, in Monroe County, the setting for the novel \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d His mother called him \u201cBuddy\u201d to distinguish him from his father, who ran a country store and then a tractor dealership. An only child, he attended a segregated school. \u201cWe never knew anything else,\u201d recalled Les Johnson, a longtime friend and a retired banker. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it was.\u201d Sessions was active in Boy Scouts and became an Eagle Scout. To this day he has the motto \u201cBe Prepared\u201d on the back of his nameplate on his desk in his Senate office. He played linebacker on the high school team. He wasn\u2019t big, \u201cbut he could sure tackle \u2019em!\u201d recalled Kay Ivey, a friend. \u201cSome people called him \u2018the knee-knocker.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cbottom line,\u201d said Ivey, who is now Alabama\u2019s lieutenant governor, \u201cis Jeff Sessions is a man of his word. If he tells you something, you can take it to the bank. He\u2019s straight as an arrow and believes in the rule of law. Just like in football, when he grabs on to something, he hangs on tight.\u201d Sessions left home for college, attending a Methodist liberal arts college in Montgomery, Ala., called Huntingdon. He met his wife-to-be, Mary Blackshear, during his freshman year, and they married after graduation. Sessions organized a chapter of the Young Republicans, at a time when Democrats ruled the state, and became student government president. \u201cThat quiet friendliness and courtesy to everyone\u201d is what got him elected, said Lindora Snyder, a college friend. After graduating from Huntingdon, Sessions earned a law degree from the University of Alabama and then joined a small law firm before becoming an assistant U.S. attorney in Mobile. After a stint at another firm, in 1981, he was appointed U.S. attorney by President Ronald Reagan. As U.S. attorney, Sessions worked with some minority communities. Robert Battles Sr., who was a neighborhood organizer in Mobile in the 1980s, said Sessions helped set up a \u201cdrug court\u201d in the county to help first-time offenders clear their records. The effort primarily helped black youths who had minor drug convictions. The voter fraud case made national news, and it was emblematic, voting rights advocates say, of a push by officials in several Southern states to try to disenfranchise black voters. Sessions was, former Justice Department officials say, the first U.S. attorney in the country to prosecute civil rights activists for voter fraud since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Albert Turner was the son of a farmer who rose to become King\u2019s field secretary in Alabama. In 1965, Turner was in the front lines of the voting rights marchers who were attacked on a bridge in Selma by billy-club-wielding state troopers in what came to be known as \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d In the 1980s, activists such as Turner sought to raise black voter participation by helping those who could not readily get to the polls, especially the elderly, the disabled, those who were barely literate and those who worked outside of the district in which they were registered to vote. The activists also would drop the absentee ballots in the mail. The case arose out of complaints to the district attorney brought by local black officials that Turner, who led the Perry County Civic League, and associates were taking absentee ballots and altering the votes. At the time, there was a split between two factions, both black, that were vying for power in the county, according to congressional testimony. Sessions testified to Congress in 1986 that the number of absentee ballots cast in Perry County in the primary was extraordinary: 729 out of 4,000 total. At his suggestion, he said, the FBI staked out the Marion post office before the primary and watched as the Turners and an associate, Spencer Hogue, drove up. Under a court order, election officials secretly numbered the ballots and matched them to the envelopes. \u201cThese are the sort of tactics,\u201d defense attorney J.L. Chestnut told the jury at the trial, that make \u201cyour American spines . . . tingle.\u201d Sessions explained what the authorities found. \u201cWhen those ballots were opened, there was a substantial number of them that had candidates\u2019 names crossed out,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThere would be an \u2018X\u2019 by one candidate and both the name and the X would be crossed out and an X placed beside another candidate\u2019s name.\u201d A total of 75 ballots had been changed, he said. Any changes were made by the voters of their own volition, Evelyn Turner said in an interview. Her husband, she said, would tell the voter: \u201cIf this is not the person you want to vote for, then just draw a line through it. And he would even make them initial it,\u201d she said. Such voter assistance was permitted by state law. Albert Turner died in 2000. But his younger brother, Robert Turner, 65, who is a lawyer in Marion and was also part of the defense team, is convinced that Sessions wanted to use his brother\u2019s visibility to send a message. \u201cYou got a person like Albert Turner that\u2019s out front, spearheading all these voter registration drives, why not put him in jail and see how many people get scared?\u201d he said. Sessions has said he believed the prosecution was \u201cwell founded,\u201d and he denied accusations that he was seeking to suppress black turnout. Sessions\u2019s views on race burst onto the national stage a year later, in 1986, when Reagan nominated him to be a federal judge. Not only did the Turner case get rehashed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, but remarks he had made in other cases emerged, too. One of the most controversial was a quip he made during the 1983 investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. A 19-year-old African American, Michael Donald, had been attacked by two members of the Klan, who snatched him at gunpoint while he was walking home in Mobile, drove him to an empty field, beat him with a tree limb, slit his throat and hanged him from a tree. It was the last recorded case of a Klan lynching. After local officials botched the investigation, the Justice Department intervened. Barry F. Kowalski was a white lawyer in the department\u2019s civil rights division when he traveled to Mobile to work for four months on the investigation. In the South at that time, not all U.S. attorneys welcomed department lawyers from Washington, but Sessions was \u201centirely supportive,\u201d said Kowalski, who is now retired. \u201cHe was instrumental in making sure that both the state and federal prosecutions happened,\u201d Kowalski said in an interview. Both men were convicted. One, after pleading guilty to criminal conspiracy in federal court, was sent to prison for life. The other, convicted in state court, was executed. \u201cYou get close to somebody when you\u2019re working together on a sensitive case,\u201d Kowalski said. \u201cI got close enough to him that I am convinced that he sincerely cared about solving that vicious murder and lynching of an African American.\u201d At one point in the investigation, Kowalski told Sessions that the Klansmen had been smoking marijuana and drinking on the night of the attack. Sessions seemed surprised that Klansmen would smoke marijuana, and Kowalski said he teased him that it was the 1980s. To which Sessions replied, as Kowalski remembers: \u201cI used to respect them, but if they smoke pot, I sure can\u2019t.\u201d Kowalski took it as a joke between two men working on a grim murder. \u201cIt was hospital humor,\u201d he said. Later, in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, Sessions made the same comment, but this time, two other lawyers were also present: Thomas H. Figures and Albert Glenn. Figures, the only black prosecutor in the office, who was also working on the case, later testified before the Judiciary Committee that he was deeply offended and did not think the comment was a joke. Kowalski and Glenn, also white, testified they thought the comment was intended to be humorous. Other allegations of insensitive remarks were aired at the more than 19-hour hearing. One witness said that Sessions called the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201cCommunist-inspired.\u201d Sessions denied making some statements, said others were taken out of context, and at one point said he could be \u201cloose with my tongue.\u201d Finally, he said, forcefully: \u201cI am not the Jeff Sessions my detractors have tried to create. I am not a racist. I am not insensitive to blacks. I have supported civil rights activity in my state.\u201d The Republican-led committee, including his home-state senator, Howell Heflin, rejected his nomination by a vote of 10 to eight. In 1995, Sessions became state attorney general. A year later, he ran for the U.S. Senate, winning the seat vacated by Heflin, who retired. Sessions joined the committee that had rejected him. As a senator, Sessions hired William Smith, the first black Republican chief counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Smith said that he never saw any indications of racially insensitive behavior. \u201cJeff Sessions is a man who cared for me, who looked out for me and who had my best interests in mind,\u201d said Smith, who is now the chief of staff for Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.). \u201cSo, anybody who says anything different doesn\u2019t know Jeff Sessions. In February, Evelyn Turner traveled to Washington to represent her husband in a ceremony awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the \u201cfoot soldiers\u201d who took part in the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery. Sessions had sponsored the legislation in the Senate. Civil rights activists and their families, along with leaders of the Senate and the House, filled the grand Emancipation Hall of the Capitol Visitors Center. Sessions rose to speak. \u201cI was a teenager at the time of this march growing up 35 miles south in the little town of Camden, attending all-white segregated schools,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw evidence of discrimination virtually every day. I think even the youth of our time were aware of the historic events that were beginning to unfold in Selma, but maybe probably not fully understanding the significance of it. \u201cCertainly,\u201d he said, looking out at the sea of faces, \u201cI feel like I should have stepped forward more and been a leader and a more positive force in the great events that were occurring.\u201d He invoked the name of the man he had once tried to send to prison years after the march. \u201cSeeing that film [footage of the march], I always see Albert Turner Sr. in the front with his white hat going down when the troopers attacked.\u2019\u2019 Sessions praised the foot soldiers for their \u201ccourage and fidelity\u201d and added: \u201cMore needs to be done. We need to join closer hands.\u201d Afterward, he greeted the Alabama delegation. He reached out to hug Evelyn Turner. But she held him off. \u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to hug you. You tried to send us off for . . . years,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way, Mrs. Turner,\u201d he said, as she recalled. Her son, Albert Turner Jr., who was at her side, turned to her. \u201cMama, that\u2019s over with. You\u2019re old now. You\u2019ve got to forgive him,\u201d he said. \u201cI might forgive him,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I won\u2019t forget.\u201d Michelle Ye Hee Lee, Julie Tate and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report. **Correction** : _An earlier version of this report incorrectly said that Albert Turner Sr. was the son of a sharecropper.

Jeff Sessions sought to assure the American public Tuesday that he could set aside campaign rhetoric and fairly enforce the law as the next U.S. attorney general, asserting repeatedly at his confirmation hearing that he would not let his personal views interfere with court precedent or the will of Congress. Sessions (R-Ala.) said, although his politics might indicate otherwise, that he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights and that he would similarly follow the 5-to-4 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said he understands that the waterboarding of suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal\u201d and, though he voted against a law that banned the government\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, that he would uphold it as attorney general.

He answered politely, although often forcefully, and frequently referred to his decades of experience in the Senate. He is expected to be confirmed. \u201cYou know who I am,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cYou know what I believe in. You know that I am a man of my word and can be trusted to do what I say I will do.\u201d On some topics, Sessions, 70, held his ground. He said, for example, that he supports the continued operation of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for terrorism suspects. He said he would not object if \u00adPresident-elect Donald Trump abandoned an executive action by President Obama that allows people who came to the United States illegally as children to receive work permits and a reprieve from possible deportation, although he offered no solution for what to do with those who had received such reprieves. He refused to agree to keep intact consent decrees prompting reform in police departments across the country, saying such agreements and the lawsuits that lead to them \u201cundermine the respect for police officers\u201d and should be approached with \u201ccaution.\u201d Justice Department officials have been pressing to negotiate such reforms in Baltimore and Chicago before the end of the Obama administration. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t commit that there would never be any changes in them, and if departments have complied or reached other developments that could justify the withdrawal or modification of a consent decree, of course I would do that,\u201d Sessions said. He said, though, that he would enforce existing agreements. Sessions declined to say that he would adopt the policies of former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. when it comes to investigations involving the news media, including a promise not to jail reporters for doing their job. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said when asked whether he would keep that Holder promise. \u201cI have not studied those regulations.\u201d But Sessions also seemed to recognize that, if confirmed, he would have to abandon his persona as a far-right lawmaker and an unabashed Trump supporter. He said that the attorney general should enforce the law regardless of the president\u2019s views and that if the president presses for illegal action, the attorney general should resign. \u201cHe or she must be willing to tell the president or other top officials \u2018no\u2019 if he or they overreach,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cHe or she cannot be a mere rubber stamp.\u201d Sessions spoke in a room packed with demonstrators, reporters and his family members, and the proceedings were interrupted several times by protesters declaring him \u201cevil\u201d or \u201cracist.\u201d Capitol Police said 25 were arrested \u2014 18 at the hearing and seven in Sessions\u2019s office. The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations of racially insensitive remarks, and civil rights advocates and others have mounted a campaign to deny him the attorney general post. Democratic senators took up many of their issues Tuesday, questioning Sessions on his opposition to the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expanded federal hate crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity, and his decision not to support an iteration of the Violence Against Women Act that gave Native Americans special protections. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Sessions about prior comments in which he suggested, after a video emerged of Trump talking about grabbing women by the genitals, that such conduct was not necessarily sexual assault. \u201cSenator, is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?\u201d Leahy said. \u201cClearly, it would be,\u201d Sessions responded. He later suggested that a sitting president could be prosecuted for doing so \u201cif appropriate.\u201d Sessions said that he supported the Violence Against Women Act broadly and that he thought hate crimes \u201cwere being prosecuted effectively in state courts where they would normally be expected to be prosecuted.\u201d He sought to portray the allegations that sunk him in 1986 \u2014 when even Coretta Scott King, the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., urged Congress to turn him down \u2014 as inaccurate. Sessions said his controversial prosecution of civil rights advocates \u2014 rather than being an effort to stifle voting \u2014 was done in response to complaints from African American incumbent officials. He assailed white supremacists. \u201cI abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,\u201d he said. He denied calling the NAACP \u201cun-American\u201d \u2014 a charge leveled against him by a fellow lawyer. \u201cI hope my tenure in this body has shown you that the caricature that was created of me was not accurate,\u201d he said. Sessions\u2019s assertion on the Clinton investigations was an early highlight of the hearing, notable because the future of the inquiries has long been a source of speculation. Trump said during the campaign that he would appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Clinton, his Democratic rival, even after the FBI concluded that it could not recommend criminal charges. But he has since softened that stance and suggested that he wants to move past the matter. Sessions has been critical of the Clinton email investigation, and he has said it \u201cseems like\u201d the FBI did not fully investigate the dealings of the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state. The two inquiries are separate, and although the email investigation has ended, the status of the foundation matter is murkier. Justice Department public-integrity prosecutors told FBI agents last year that they had no case, but agents have apparently continued to press the matter. A defense attorney for Clinton declined to comment on Sessions\u2019s claim that he would recuse himself. Later in the hearing, pressed on whether he would recuse himself on Trump investigations, Sessions said he \u201cwould review it and try to do the right thing.\u201d Of Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States, Sessions said he thought the president-elect favored stringent vetting of those coming from countries with a history of terrorism. He said he voted against a resolution that would have objected to a Muslim ban because he thought it would not have allowed for religion to be considered in the vetting process. \u201cMany people do have religious views that are inimical to the public safety of the United States,\u201d Sessions said. He said he would not support an immigration ban that excluded people solely because they are Muslim. Sessions also addressed issues of policing, saying that officers have come to feel \u201cunfairly maligned and blamed for the unacceptable actions of a few of their bad actors.\u201d He cited violent-crime statistics, such as Chicago\u2019s 4,368 shooting victims in 2016 and the 11 percent increase in homicides nationwide from 2014 to 2015 \u2014 and promised that he would prioritize turning the tide. Sessions acknowledged that he is not well-informed about the recent high-profile cyber-provocations by Russia. When asked by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) if he thought the Russian government was behind the hacking of Democratic Party computers, he said, \u201cI have done no research into that.\u201d When Graham pointed out that the FBI had concluded Russia was behind the intrusion, Sessions observed, \u201cat least that\u2019s what\u2019s been reported.\u201d Later, he allowed, \u201cI have no reason to doubt that,\u201d and he said the response to such action might not be as simple as prosecuting a case. \u201cIn many ways, the political response, the international foreign policy response, may be the only recourse,\u201d he said. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) asked Sessions whether he would let an investigation of Russian interference continue, \u201ceven if it leads to the Trump campaign and Trump interests and associates.\u201d Sessions replied: \u201cIf the law is violated and they can be prosecuted, then you\u2019ll have to handle that in an appropriate way.\u201d On Wednesday, 15 witnesses are scheduled speak about the nominee, including a former attorney general, the president of a national police union, and several civil rights and other advocates. Late Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee said that one of Sessions\u2019s colleagues, Sen.

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) can operate independently of the president if confirmed as attorney general \u2014 a debate that took on new importance after President Trump\u2019s late-night firing of acting attorney general Sally Yates for refusing to defend his immigration order. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the committee\u2019s chairman, said that Sessions will \u201cfollow the law, regardless of whether he would have supported it as a matter of policy as a senator.\u201d He said Sessions offered no help in drafting Trump\u2019s order, although it is \u201cnot clear to me why it would be a problem even if he had been involved.\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the panel, attacked Trump\u2019s order and noted that Sessions\u2019s ideals seem to have at least shaped it. She read aloud from Yates\u2019s memo declaring that she did not find Trump\u2019s immigration order lawful, then referenced the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre,\u201d when two top Justice Department officials resigned over an order from President Richard Nixon. \u201cMembers, that statement took guts,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cThat statement said what an independent attorney general should do. That statement took a steel spine to stand up and say no. It took the courage of Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus, who stood up to President Nixon. That is what an attorney general must be willing and able to do. I have no confidence that Senator Sessions will do that.\u201d The committee scheduled a vote on Sessions\u2019s nomination for Wednesday morning. A vote by the full Senate is expected later in the week. Trump replaced Yates with Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who said he would enforce the president\u2019s directive to temporarily ban entry into the United States for citizens from seven Muslim- majority countries and refugees from around the world. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said he will vote against the nominee because of concerns about Sessions\u2019s civil rights record, his failure to address Russia\u2019s interference in the November presidential election and ethical conflicts in the Trump administration, among other issues. He took aim Tuesday at Trump\u2019s firing of Yates, saying the president had \u201cplaced the independence of the Justice Department at stake.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve said and I believe the president\u2019s decision to fire acting attorney general Sally Yates is shameful,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cHis accusation that she betrayed the Department of Justice is dangerous. The attorney general is the people\u2019s attorney, not the president\u2019s attorney.\u201d On the first day of his confirmation hearing, Jan. 10, Sessions sought to assure senators that he could fairly enforce the law as attorney general, and he said repeatedly during that day\u2019s eight-hour grilling that he would not let his personal views interfere with his duties. He said he would abide by Supreme Court decisions on abortion rights and legalized same-sex marriage, although he opposes both. And Sessions said he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices or her family\u2019s charitable foundation \u2014 issues he raised while campaigning for Trump. On the hearing\u2019s second day, several civil rights leaders spoke out against Sessions, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) broke with tradition by testifying as a sitting senator against a colleague. Booker said he believed that, as attorney general, Sessions would not defend voting rights or the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Appearing on the nominee\u2019s behalf, Michael Mukasey, a former federal judge who served as attorney general under President George W. Bush, testified that Sessions is \u201cthoroughly dedicated to the rule of law and the mission of the department.\u201d Ron Hosko, president of the nonprofit Law Enforcement Action Network and a former FBI assistant director, sent a letter in support of Sessions to the Judiciary Committee on Monday and said 20,000 members or supporters of the law enforcement community were backing his nomination. \u201cSen. Sessions enjoys great respect from law enforcement officials across the country who believe the nation will be well served by his confirmation,\u201d Hosko said. But no Democrat on the committee has declared an intention to vote for Sessions, and Democrats are increasing efforts to delay the confirmation of several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees.

Cory Booker testified Wednesday that Sen. Jeff Sessions is the wrong man to lead the Justice Department, saying the Alabama Republican\u2019s lengthy record in Congress exposed views that are inconsistent with the venerated job he is seeking. In a passionate speech from the witness table, the New Jersey Democrat ticked off issue after issue, asserting in each instance that Sessions would not seek justice as the U.S. attorney general. \u201cIf confirmed, Senator Sessions will be required to pursue justice for women, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t,\u201d Booker said. \u201cHe will be expected to defend the equal rights of gay and lesbian and transgender Americans, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t. He will be expected to defend voting rights, but his record indicates that he won\u2019t. He will be expected to defend the rights of immigrants and affirm their human dignity, but the record indicates that he won\u2019t.\u201d The remarks marked the first time a sitting senator has testified against a colleague\u2019s nomination for a Cabinet post, and they were among the most notable in Sessions\u2019s two-day confirmation hearing. In total, legislators heard testimony from 15 supporters and detractors, and Sessions answered questions over more than 101/2 hours. Nothing that was said was likely to stop the Republican-controlled Senate from confirming him, with Democrats failing to land anything close to a fatal blow during the hearing. Booker said he could not stay silent, even though he knew some colleagues \u201caren\u2019t happy that I am breaking with Senate tradition.\u201d \u201cIn the choice between standing with Senate norms or standing up for what my conscience tells me is best for our country, I will always choose conscience and country,\u201d he said. And he came after Sessions perhaps more forcefully than any witness before him. \u201cSenator Sessions has not demonstrated a commitment to a central requisite of the job \u2014 to aggressively pursue the congressional mandate of civil rights, equal rights and justice for all of our citizens,\u201d Booker said. \u201cIn fact, at numerous times in his career, he has demonstrated a hostility toward these convictions.\u201d Sessions is generally well liked in the Senate, despite views that draw polarized responses. To those in law enforcement and conservative legal circles, he is an honorable man, dedicated to enforcing the law no matter his personal feelings. To civil rights advocates, immigrant advocates and others, his record makes him a troubling selection to lead the Justice Department. Former attorney general Michael Mukasey testified Wednesday that Sessions is \u201cthoroughly dedicated to the rule of law and the mission of the department.\u201d Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, said his voting record and actions \u201cdemonstrate an unwavering commitment to equal protection under the law.\u201d But David Cole, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that record \u201craises serious questions about the fitness of Senator Sessions to be an attorney general for all American people.\u201d And Amita Swadhin, a rape survivor, attacked Sessions for saying that grabbing a woman by the genitals does not necessarily constitute sexual assault. That comment by Sessions came after the a video that recorded Trump talking about such conduct went public. \u201cMillions of sexual-assault survivors were triggered in the wake of these events,\u201d Swadhin said. The senator has since said his remarks were bungled, and on Tuesday he asserted unequivocally that grabbing a woman by the genitals is sexual assault. In his testimony, Sessions sought to persuade his colleagues that he would assiduously enforce the law. He said that although his politics may indicate otherwise, he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights and would similarly follow the ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. He said he understands that the waterboarding of terrorism suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal.\u201d Finally, he declared that he would recuse himself from any Justice Department investigations of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices as secretary of state or her family\u2019s charitable foundation \u2014 mindful that his previous comments \u201ccould place my objectivity in question.\u201d Trump said this of his nominee\u2019s performance: \u201cHe was brilliant.\u201d Democratic lawmakers used the witnesses to highlight some of Sessions\u2019s more controversial stances, such as his opposition to a hate-crimes bill and his expression of support for a Supreme Court decision that invalidated parts of the Voting Rights Act. Republicans, meanwhile, tried to cast those opposed to the nominee as biased and unwilling to give him a fair chance. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) debated with the ACLU\u2019s Cole over whether a critical report the group released on Sessions left out key details. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) questioned NAACP President Cornell William Brooks about his organization\u2019s low rating of Sessions, noting that virtually all Republicans received poor marks. \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t make us all racist,\u201d Graham quipped. Oscar Vazquez told legislators how he had come to the United States with documents when he was just 12, taking a bus with his mother from Mexico. He said he always considered the United States home, but when he sought to enlist in the Army near the end of high school, a recruiter told him he couldn\u2019t, because of his immigration status. Vazquez would go on to enroll at Arizona State University, marry a U.S. citizen and \u2014 eventually \u2014 get the documentation he needed to serve in the military, including in Afghanistan. He said undocumented immigrants are worried about Sessions as attorney general, especially those who took advantage of an executive action by President Obama allowing people who came to the United States illegally as children to receive work permits. \u201cThere is a lot of fear, most of all,\u201d Vazquez said. But supporter Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, spoke of how Sessions would improve relations between federal authorities and local police and perhaps not be so quick to judge officers involved in high-profile incidents. \u201cThe lines of communications will be more direct than they have been,\u201d Canterbury said of the Justice Department under Sessions. Sessions talked Tuesday of improving morale in local police departments, which he maintained had been unfairly maligned, and he notably refused to commit to leaving unchanged consent decrees mandating changes at certain departments. On Thursday, Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch is scheduled to travel to Baltimore to announce such a decree in Baltimore, where the 2015 death of a black man in police custody led to riots.", "qid": 870, "docid": "5683ce24-d796-11e6-9a36-1d296534b31e", "score": 12.110099792480469}, {"content": "Title: House turns into battleground over LGBT rights Content: The House floor is turning into an emotional, and at times ugly, battleground over LGBT rights, as Democrats accuse Republicans of promoting bigotry and discrimination over proposals GOP leaders say are intended to protect freedom of religion from government overreach. The conflict erupted on Thursday when Republican leaders successfully whipped their members to vote down a Democratic amendment that sought to prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to pay contractors that discriminate against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The proposal authored by Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), an openly gay member of Congress, appeared on the cusp of being adopted as the vote came to a close, but at the last minute six Republican members switched their votes and the amendment was defeated on a 212-to-213 vote. Outraged Democrats shouted \u201cshame\u201d and accused Republican leaders of abusing chamber rules by holding the vote open until they could twist enough arms to kill the amendment. \u201cThey literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cWe won this vote.\u201d Maloney told reporters that when he saw House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) \u201cpersonally twisting arms on the floor,\u201d he asked him to let the vote conclude only to be told to \u201cto get back on my own side\u201d of the aisle. Democratic leaders have accused seven Republicans of changing their votes on Maloney\u2019s amendment under pressure from Republican leaders, including: Reps. Darrell Issa, Jeff Denham, Mimi Walters and David Valadao of California; Greg Walden of Oregon who is also the chair of the House GOP campaign arm; David Young of Iowa; and Bruce Poliquin of Maine. Spokespersons for most those members did not immediately return requests for comment Thursday afternoon; in a statement, Poliquin said he was \u201coutraged that political opponents or members of the press would claim or insinuate that I cast a vote due to pressure or party politics,\u201d but did not directly refute the charge that he changed his vote. Twenty-nine other Republicans voted in favor of the amendment. But they weren\u2019t necessarily happy to see the issue raised in the context of an appropriations bill. \u201cToo many members are losing perspective on what it is we\u2019re trying to do today, so that\u2019s I guess what frustrates me,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that wrote Thursday\u2019s bill. The moderate Republican backed Maloney\u2019s amendment on Thursday \u2014 and before that, tried to strip out the religious liberty language from the bill that eventually landed on the floor. Dent said he anticipated similar amendments to \u201cmany more appropriations bills\u201d in the future. Democrats have not yet specified where they plan to bring up anti-discrimination measures going forward, save to promise that more will be coming soon. Democratic leaders took the opportunity to accuse House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) of being hypocritical in promising a more transparent process. \u201cEvidently Speaker Ryan\u2019s promises of regular order mean nothing, when regular order means a majority of the House standing up to protect LGBT Americans from bigotry,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. Advocates for LGBT rights are also decrying GOP leaders for having \u201cabused the voting procedures\u201d and the members who changed their votes for \u201cshamefully\u201d allowing them \u201cto write discrimination into federal law,\u201d David Stacy of the Human Rights Campaign said. A GOP leadership aide retorted that holding a two minute vote open for seven minutes \u201cis not significantly out of the ordinary,\u201d and that \u201cno one was forced to change their vote.\u201d After the vote closed, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) took to the microphone to rail against Republicans in protest, as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) walked around the Democrats\u2019 side of the floor waving a red vote card and urging her members to vote no on the underlying military construction and veterans programs spending bill so that Republicans \u201cget the message.\u201d But GOP leaders made no apology for prioritizing veterans and troops \u201cover a political messaging amendment that could have jeopardized the final passage of the appropriations bill,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) The spending bill ultimately was passed on a 295-to-129 vote, with 57 Democrats voting in favor of the legislation. Only four Republicans voted against the final bill, and none of those four had supported Maloney\u2019s amendment. The House fracas comes as a national debate is underway over LGBT rights. The battle has reached a fever pitch in North Carolina, where Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed into law a measure to ban transgender individuals from using a bathroom that does not correspond with the gender on their birth certificates. Corporations boycotted the state after the measure was enacted, and the federal government and North Carolina have now slapped competing lawsuits against each other. Tensions over the issue in the House surfaced in recent weeks when a provision was added to the annual defense policy bill by Rep. Steve Russell (R-Okla.) that would exempt religious organizations that contract with the federal government from certain parts of civil rights law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Democrats and some moderate Republicans decried the proposal, but earlier this week GOP leaders blocked them from holding a vote to strip the language from the defense bill when it was on the floor. The battle then moved to Thursday when the chamber considered one of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which historically have been allowed to have a more free-wheeling amendment process. The vote on Thursday is just one chapter in a fight that promises to occupy Congress in the coming weeks as both Republicans and Democrats plan further legislative measures to force the House to take a stand on the divide over whether certain policies, such as those concerning hiring practices and public bathrooms, amount to LGBT discrimination or protections for freedom of religion. When and where the fight will be waged remains murky. Ryan declined to say on Thursday whether Republicans would bring up measures to curtail the Obama administration\u2019s efforts on LGBT rights, which include his recent directive to schools to accommodate transgender students in the bathrooms of their choosing. Ryan told reporters only that that such matters \u201cshould be left up to the states.\u201d But Ryan \u201cis engaged in understanding\u201d how the House will try to push back on the transgender bathrooms issue, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) said. \u201cWe\u2019ve encouraged him, I\u2019ve encouraged him, he\u2019s been encouraged,\u201d he added. One option may be a new bill from Rep. Luke Messer (R-Ind.), which seeks to block President Obama\u2019s executive order on transgender bathrooms by preventing the administration from withholding federal funding from schools that don\u2019t comply with the order. Messer said Thursday he is looking for must-pass vehicles as potential avenues for the legislation, such as appropriations bills. \u201cI can assure you we\u2019ll try to do something in appropriations on this issue for sure,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee and a close ally of its chairman and the speaker. Democrats said many Republicans would regret votes that could be viewed as discriminatory toward the LGBT community, singling out those who switched their votes on Thursday. \u201cThese things are going to be remembered,\u201d Maloney said, likening the votes to being on \u201cthe wrong side of the march toward Selma\u201d and \u201cstanding in the schoolhouse door\u201d to prevent the integration of schools. He said the lawmakers who switched their votes Thursday would \u201chave this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "153bc0a9d24af715af2772b0ce61dab5", "score": 12.064399719238281}, {"content": "Title: In a year of setbacks, activists push to encourage more LGBT candidates Content: CHARLOTTE \u2014 Jane Campbell and her wife were crushed when North Carolina passed a law that rolled back rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Then Campbell, a retired Navy captain, took a dramatic step: She decided to run against one of the bill\u2019s supporters. \u201cHB2 was really the thing that spurred my interest,\u201d Campbell said, referring to what the law was called in the legislature. Campbell and others gathered at a Charlotte hotel here last weekend to participate in a four-day training for aspiring LGBT politicians and political operatives. The training, put on by the Gay and Lesbian Victory Institute, which works to elect LGBT people to office, has been going on for years. But its leaders and many attendees said their mission has taken on a more urgent quality. In the wake of last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, hundreds of pieces of anti-gay legislation were introduced in statehouses nationwide. The LGBT community has also been galvanized by the terrorist shooting attack two weeks ago in Orlando targeting a gay nightclub, killing 49. Here in North Carolina, the HB2 law rolled back local anti\u00addiscrimination provisions and required transgender people to use public bathrooms corresponding with their birth gender. In Mississippi, a law allowing businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples was slated to go into effect on Friday. A federal judge struck down the law late Thursday night. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone took a barrel of ice water and doused us with it, and people are feeling that shock,\u201d said Victory Institute president Aisha C. Moodie-Mills, referring to setbacks in the year since the marriage ruling. Mills said the decision to come to Charlotte underscores one of the group\u2019s major goals: to try to get gay people elected in places where there is little representation. The South has only a small handful of gay elected officials; here in North Carolina, the only gay legislator was appointed, not elected. Nationwide, there are 470 LGBT people in elected or appointed office, according to the group. Recent training sessions have been held in Salt Lake City and Indiana after the state passed a religious liberty law. This week, two transgender women won Democratic congressional primaries in the West. Misty K. Snow, a 30-year-old Democrat who works at a grocery store, will face incumbent Sen. Mike Lee (R) in Utah\u2019s Senate race. Misty Plowright, a 33-year-old IT consultant, will challenge Rep. Doug Lamborn (R) in Colorado for a seat in the House district near Colorado Springs. In an interview, Snow said she decided to run because she doesn\u2019t think the working class and poor are adequately represented in Washington. She did not go through the Victory Institute\u2019s training. \u201cI decided that there\u2019s not enough working-class people in government,\u201d said Snow, who plans to keep working throughout the campaign. \u201cI just happen to be trans. It\u2019s not why I\u2019m running.\u201d Plowright also said she plans to make fighting for the working class a big part of her platform, along with shoring up the nation\u2019s aging infrastructure and pushing to get high-speed broadband installed nationwide. \u201cI\u2019m not a one-trick pony, and I don\u2019t want to be a token candidate,\u201d she said. But talking with a friend who opened a nonprofit organization that does transgender activism in Seattle and attending the Colorado Democratic convention this year led her to take the leap and run. \u201cAs a trans woman, I\u2019ve been content for a long time to just kind of hide in the shadows, blend in, not make waves, not get noticed. It\u2019s just safer that way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe more of us that get out there and the more of us that fight and the more visible we are, the better things are going to get.\u201d Here in North Carolina, opposition to the transgender law, which also contains provisions on minimum wage and suing for discrimination, has galvanized Campbell and others who want to try to fight it politically. The epicenter of the fight is in Charlotte, where the city council passed a non-discrimination ordinance in February extending new protections to LGBT people. The following month, Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed HB2, now widely known as the \u201cbathroom law.\u201d Some fighting to repeal the law say having more LGBT people in politics will help. \u201cStop marching and holding hands and get your butt out and vote,\u201d Charlotte City Councilor \u00adLaWana Mayfield, who is a lesbian, said at the training session. \u201cUnless we get angry enough to stop talking about it and do something about it, nothing\u2019s going to change.\u201d Kawana Davis, 31, was on the receiving end of an email from Mayfield and others seeking LGBT people to attend the training. \u201cThere was no way I couldn\u2019t get involved\u201d after the bathroom law passed, she said. Davis describes herself as a \u201cbehind the scenes girl\u201d and could see herself as a campaign manager or strategist. \u201cTo help LGBT folks have a successful campaign, that\u2019s a need,\u201d she said. Davis and about 20 others, most from the South and the Eastern Seaboard, spent the weekend holed up inside a hotel here, where they sketched out an entire campaign for a fake candidate. Some came in direct response to HB2. Others have long harbored political ambitions. Some are total novices. Joe Fuld, a Democratic strategist who led the weekend session, broke down the nuts and bolts of campaigning. A Republican strategist also leads workshops. \u201cWhat\u2019s a bad motivation to run?\u201d Fuld asked. \u201cMoney,\u201d someone shouted. \u201cPower,\u201d said another. \u201cFame,\u201d a man said. Fuld suggested the candidates do a personal assessment, too: Is your family on board? Are you ready to run? Fundraising, he told them, is crucial but takes up a lot of time and energy. He said to talk about filling potholes, changing the educational system or other issues that voters care about. \u201cThose are things that you are going to do as opposed to being the LGBT candidate or the gay guy or the trans person,\u201d he said. Campbell and her wife spent most of the spring going door to door in Davidson, N.C., where they live, gathering signatures for Campbell to get on the ballot as an unaffiliated candidate challenging Rep. John R. Bradford III (R). She said the effort was a good opportunity to hear potential constituents talk about the issues most important to them, including education and regional infrastructure. Tanner Glenn, 20, a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is taking next semester off to manage the campaign of a former high school history teacher running for state legislature. Glenn came to the training to learn more about the nuts and bolts of campaigns and understand what the playing field looks like for gays and lesbians who are candidates or behind the scenes. The fight here over HB2, he said, makes it more crucial than ever to have more gay people involved in politics. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a motivating factor,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cIt shows there is a lot of work to do.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "c70514a8-3991-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb", "score": 12.051300048828125}, {"content": "Title: A quartet of criticism for President Trump with this message: Change your behavior Content: President Trump recorded something remarkable this past week. In fewer than 72 hours, he was rebuked by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief scout executive for the Boy Scouts of America and the Suffolk County police on Long Island. At a time when many eyes and ears in Washington are riveted on the staff shake-up at the White House and what it portends, no one should lose sight of the incoming fire that has arrived at the White House and what it says. The words didn\u2019t come from the hard left or the Democratic resistance. Instead, they came from people who represent communities or constituencies considered friendly to the president: the Republican Party, the military, the police, and a civic organization known for its promotion of patriotism and traditional values. The critiques were carefully worded so as not to give too much offense to a sitting president, but they were unmistakable in their intent. In their own ways, the messages to the president carried a common theme: They asked him to stop behaving as he has been behaving. Trump has crossed so many lines \u2014 as a candidate and as president \u2014 that the public often is numbed to what he says and does. Not this time. Perhaps that\u2019s because each of the pushbacks dealt with a different transgression, all of them coming in the period of only a few days. It\u2019s far too early to know whether this marks a turning point in how people who have been at least nominally supportive of the president will approach him in the future, but Trump ought not to be dismissive of their significance. The critiques might not change the president\u2019s behavior, but as a marker of the rising concern even from his allies, they couldn\u2019t have been more obvious. The first came from Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the generally even- tempered chairman of the Judiciary Committee. It was in response to the president\u2019s repeated tweets and statements brutalizing Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The president will not forgive Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, and as Trump\u2019s blood pressure has risen week by week, he decided to lash out. The tweets attacking Sessions and the president\u2019s other comments aimed at unsettling a member of his Cabinet and early supporter \u2014 \u201cTime will tell,\u201d Trump said when asked about the attorney general\u2019s future \u2014 sparked fears that the president was looking to fire Sessions or force him to resign, with the obvious next step of appointing someone who in one way or another could contain or get rid of the Russia investigation now in the hands of special counsel Robert Mueller. In terse language, Grassley made clear that he would not consider holding confirmation hearings for a replacement any time this year. That would leave the Justice Department in the hands of Rod J. Rosenstein, the career prosecutor who is deputy attorney general and has also earned Trump\u2019s disrespect, for appointing Mueller. Grassley\u2019s stamp of disapproval was an extension of the chorus of support for Sessions from his former colleagues in the Senate, particularly those in the Republican Party. They responded to the president\u2019s public humiliation of the attorney general and the implied threat to Mueller with varying degrees of alarm. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said there would be \u201choly hell to pay\u201d if Trump decides to force Sessions out and rein in Mueller\u2019s operation. For the most part, Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought to avert their gaze whenever the president\u2019s tweets or actions spark controversy. So there has been nothing like this so far in Trump\u2019s presidency. Whether that\u2019s because it involves a former member of the Capitol Hill club or because of the potential implications for a constitutional crisis if the president tries to scuttle the Mueller investigation, the response to this has been different. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs, was responding to a different controversy: the president\u2019s sudden and unexpected announcement \u2014 via Twitter \u2014 that transgender individuals would be barred from military service. Amid confusion within the ranks, Dunford issued a statement saying there would be \u201cno modification\u201d to current policy until the Pentagon receives an actual directive from the president and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has had adequate time to evaluate it and decides how to implement it. In other words, the Pentagon will not allow the president to change policy through a tweet. As was reported in the hours after Trump\u2019s tweet, Pentagon officials were caught by surprise by the proposed ban. The reaction to the ban was immediate, starting with the LGBT community and transgender members of the military and extending to Democratic and Republican lawmakers and much of the populace at large. If Trump was simply playing to the culturally conservative part of his political base, he miscalculated the overall state of public opinion \u2014 and perhaps of his own military. The third rebuke came in two stages. It took the leaders of the Boy Scouts several days to issue a full criticism of the president\u2019s appearance at the National Jamboree. Presidents are always invited to address Scouts at the jamboree. Those who have done so in the past have stuck to obvious themes of service, civic virtue and pride in America. Trump treated his appearance as just another raucous political rally. He was partisan, attacking rival Hillary Clinton and former president Barack Obama. He was offensive, talking to the young Americans about the \u201chottest\u201d parties in New York and a rich friend who he said did things he couldn\u2019t reveal to such a young audience. No doubt unwilling to directly criticize the president, the Scout association initially issued an anodyne statement reminding everyone that the Boy Scouts are open to all ideas and generally free of politics and partisanship. On Thursday, Michael Surbaugh, the chief scout executive, went further, issuing a lengthy apology on the Boy Scouts website. The good works by Scouts at the jamboree, he said, had been \u201covershadowed by the remarks offered by the president of the United States.\u201d He extended \u201csincere apologies\u201d to those offended and said injecting partisan politics into the event was \u201cnever our intent.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about the apology at her briefing. She said she hadn\u2019t read it. She said she was at the jamboree with the president and saw nothing inappropriate in his words. She noted as well that many of the Scouts were cheering the president, which was true. Older and more experienced members of the Scouting family knew the president crossed a line, and the reaction was swift and harsh. The fourth disavowal of a presidential suggestion came Friday, after Trump spoke on Long Island about efforts to combat gang warfare. He offered police some advice \u2014 not to treat suspects so gingerly. He suggested that, when putting suspects into the back of a police cruiser, officers should not take precautions to protect the suspect from physical harm. The president\u2019s words drew a quick response from the Suffolk County Police Department that made clear that the department has strict procedures. \u201cAs a department, we do not and will not tolerate \u2018rough[ing]\u2019 up prisoners,\u201d the statement said, adding that officers who violate the procedures are treated with utmost seriousness. The Pentagon is likely to carry out the transgender directive (assuming it arrives from the White House) once it has been reviewed and evaluated. Trump is the president and sets policy. The Boy Scouts will retreat quickly now that they have apologized to the president\u2019s critics. They are not a combative or confrontational organization. Republican lawmakers will approach their battles with the president gingerly. They are risk averse about offending Trump\u2019s loyalists. Local police are not looking for conflict with the president. Still, the multiple pushbacks, on four separate issues, from the Trump-friendly side of the American electorate should be a signal to the president. But is he listening?", "qid": 870, "docid": "6f73e11a-7310-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304", "score": 12.048399925231934}, {"content": "Title: How bathrooms and transgender rights have become a flash point in the GOP race Content: MONROEVILLE, Pa. \u2014 Cletus Abate was aghast after learning last week that the Pennsylvania legislature is considering a bill that would extend protections to transgender people, including allowing them to use the bathrooms they choose. So she took a petition and packets outlining what opponents see as threats from the legislation to a Ted Cruz rally, handing them out to anyone who would listen, including the candidate himself. \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump came out on the news and said he doesn\u2019t have a problem with transgender bathrooms,\u201d Abate said. Transgender rights have become an unlikely and heated issue in the presidential campaign after North Carolina enacted a law that, among other things, mandated that people use the restroom that corresponds to the gender on their birth certificate. Cruz has seized on Trump\u2019s assertion that the North Carolina law, which also rolled back other protections for gay, lesbian and transgender people, was unnecessary and bad for business \u2014 corporations including PayPal and Deutsche Bank scrapped plans to create jobs in the state after the legislation was enacted. Trump said there has been \u201clittle trouble\u201d with allowing people to use the restroom they want, though he later said that states should have the power to enact their own laws. Trump also said he would let transgender reality-television star Caitlyn Jenner use the women\u2019s restroom at his properties. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he probably wouldn\u2019t have signed the North Carolina law, while both Democratic candidates have condemned it. \u201cThere\u2019s been a significant amount of conversation about it on the presidential level,\u201d said Cathryn Oakley, senior legislative counsel at the Human Rights Campaign, who said 50 anti-transgender bills have been filed nationwide this year. \u201cIn terms of it being new territory, the answer is yes.\u201d Cruz\u2019s argument centers on the idea that allowing transgender women to use women\u2019s restrooms would lead to deviants dressing up as women and preying on young girls. His campaign released an ad accusing Trump of capitulating to the \u201cPC police\u201d and asking viewers whether a grown man pretending to be a woman should use a restroom with your daughter or wife. \u201cDonald Trump thinks so,\u201d the ad reads. Cruz has woven his support of North Carolina\u2019s law into his stump speech. There has been some backlash: A woman holding a \u201cTrans lives matter\u201d sign protested outside of a stop Cruz made in Allentown, Pa., on Friday. \u201cAs the father of two young girls, I can tell you it doesn\u2019t make any sense to allow adult grown men strangers to be alone in a bathroom with little girls,\u201d Cruz said at a rally here, drawing loud applause from the crowd. He called Trump\u2019s views on transgender people \u201cpolitical correctness on steroids.\u201d \u201cEvil!\u201d a woman in the crowd yelled. President Obama weighed in on the issue Friday from Britain, which issued a travel advisory warning residents about the North Carolina law and another enacted in Mississippi that allows businesses to refuse service to same-sex couples on religious grounds. \u201cI want everybody here in the United Kingdom to know that the people of North Carolina and Mississippi are wonderful people,\u201d said Obama, who also took a question from a person who claims no gender. \u201cI also think that the laws that have been passed there are wrong and should be overturned.\u201d Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have forcefully condemned the laws, and Sanders said he would overturn them if elected president. Here in Pennsylvania, the battle over transgender rights has been brewing for years. It is the only Northeastern state that does not extend anti- discrimination protections to gay and transgender people, which some members of the Republican-controlled legislature have attempted to change in session after session. They have found an ally in Gov. Tom Wolf (D), who this month issued executive orders barring gender-based discrimination against employees and job applicants in state government and its contractors. Pennsylvania\u2019s physician general is a transgender woman. The governor has called for passage of the Pennsylvania Fairness Act, which would provide protections to gay and bisexual people in housing, employment and public accommodations \u2014 including public restrooms. An employer does not need to construct new facilities to comply. The bill is stalled in the legislature because of a contentious battle over the budget. Opponents here have seized on the national controversy over transgender rights, labeling it the \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d as many did in North Carolina. Sally Keaveney, chief of staff to state Sen. Larry Farnese (D), who sponsored the legislation, said this is the first time opponents have used the specter of transgender people in bathrooms to fight a statewide anti-discrimination bill. A number of conservative groups have launched a website dedicated to defeating the bill. It urges Pennsylvanians to call their elected officials, highlights that the bill will affect the commonwealth\u2019s public schools and claims such legislation will lead to an increase in sexual assault, something organizations who work with assault victims call a myth. More than 30 municipalities in Pennsylvania, including Allentown and Scranton, both of which Cruz visited Friday, have passed transgender protections, according to Adrian Shanker, executive director of the Bradbury-Sullivan LGBT Community Center in Allentown. \u201cWe are facing one of the most significant threats to religious liberty and privacy rights in the history of the Commonwealth,\u201d reads the handout that Abate brought here, which she got from one of the organizations opposing the measure. At least 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws barring discrimination against transgender people, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, and at least 200 cities and counties prohibit discrimination based on gender identity. Cruz has defended religious-liberty legislation in both North Carolina and Indiana, which has a primary May 3 and where controversy erupted last year after Gov. Mike Pence (R) signed a law that many viewed as anti-gay. Campaigning in Indiana over the weekend, Cruz said people have the right to do whatever they want, including if a man wishes to dress as a woman and use her home bathroom. Cruz said that he is fine with transgender people using a public unisex bathroom but that people do not have the right to impose their lifestyles on others. Cruz said that if the law allows for a man to enter \u201ca little girl\u2019s restroom, and stay there and he cannot be removed because he simply says at that moment he feels like a woman, you\u2019re opening the door for predators.\u201d Don Uber, a 69-year-old accountant from Apollo, Pa., agrees with Cruz. Uber, who has a 2-year-old granddaughter, said he is more concerned about male sexual predators dressing up as women and going into women\u2019s restrooms with girls than he is about predators using men\u2019s rooms near boys. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have other men in there that can protect the boys,\u201d Uber said. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty as men to be protectors, and opening up [women\u2019s] bathrooms to men is failing our responsibilities.\u201d Uber said he believes the law will just allow men to walk into women\u2019s rooms. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to cross-dress. You can go in in a business suit and say, \u2018I define myself as a female,\u2019 and they\u2019re okay with that,\u201d he said. Lizabeth Kleintop, a transgender woman and Moravian College professor from Bethlehem, Pa., said she uses women\u2019s restrooms not because it is a choice, but rather because she identifies as a woman. \u201cOur interest in going to the restroom is to pee,\u201d Kleintop said. Cruz does have at least one transgender fan: Jenner, who has said she supports Cruz and would like to be his transgender ambassador. In the latest episode of her show, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d Jenner was informed that Cruz supported a group of pastors that worked to defeat a Houston anti-discrimination ordinance. Jenner called Cruz \u201ctotally misinformed\u201d about transgender people but said he can \u201ctake care of the big issues.\u201d A representative for Jenner declined to comment when asked about Cruz\u2019s stance on the North Carolina law. Abate said she\u2019s willing to fight as long as it takes to defeat the bill. She insists that she is not bigoted and has gay and lesbian friends and family members but says she believes such legislation violates the rights of people, businesses and places of worship that don\u2019t want transgender people in single-sex bathrooms. Abate\u2019s newly enacted crusade is now driving her political choices. For months she has supported Trump\u2019s candidacy, but his transgender comments have made her reevaluate, just days before Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican primary on Tuesday. \u201cI guess that I am going to be pulling the lever for Cruz,\u201d she said.", "qid": 870, "docid": "e7c7ad22-08d6-11e6-bdcb-0133da18418d", "score": 12.015199661254883}, {"content": "Title: Content: Politicians jockeying for attention are hardly unusual at the Maryland General Assembly. But in this busy election year the one-upmanship has turned the legislative session into a campaign battleground, with candidates making many of the same pitches in hearing rooms that they do out on the trail. One afternoon last week, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who is seeking to drop the \u201clieutenant\u201d from his title, talked up his plan to expand pre-kindergarten programs during a packed bill hearing while television cameras rolled. A fellow Democrat hoping to best him, Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, could be found in another hearing room just up the stairs, pushing the creation of a consumer protection office for vote-rich Prince George\u2019s County. Both Gansler and Brown had offered testimony the day before on a bill to raise the minimum wage. And both plan to be back in the General Assembly next week to share their support for toughening penalties on domestic violence. With four Maryland statewide offices and all 188 of its legislative seats on the ballot this year, they are not alone in their bids to get noticed. Politics has infused policy debates on issues as varied as decriminalizing marijuana, expanding protections for transgender people and broadening access to pre-K education. On the campaign trail, all three major Democratic candidates for governor have rolled out plans to expand pre-K education in the coming years. But Brown managed to get the stage to himself on Wednesday to talk up a bill being considered by the House Ways and Means Committee that was sponsored by his current boss, Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D). During an appearance promoted by his press office, Brown acknowledged to lawmakers that this year\u2019s bill takes only a \u201cmodest\u201d step toward his goal of providing \u201cuniversal\u201d full-day pre-K for all 4-year-olds. But Brown added: \u201cI hope for those of us who have the privilege to be in Annapolis next year that we take a more robust next step.\u201d At the same hour, Gansler was testifying with Del. Jolene Ivey (D-Prince George\u2019s), who happens to be his running mate in the governor\u2019s race as well as chairman of her county\u2019s delegation in Annapolis. She told the Health and Government Operations Committee that there is \u201ca huge need\u201d for the consumer protection office Gansler is seeking. Del. Heather R. Mizeur (D-Montgomery), the third major candidate for governor, has also sought to leverage the legislative process to draw attention to her campaign. Last week, she wrote to Brown and Gansler (and sent copies to the media) inviting them to join her in testifying on a bill she is sponsoring to decriminalize marijuana. Under legislation she introduced, those caught using small amounts of the drug would be subject to no more than a $100 civil fine, something akin to a traffic ticket. Both Brown and Gansler support the idea \u2014 but neither agreed to appear alongside her. Elbowing for attention is hardly confined to the gubernatorial candidates. One of the opening rounds in a battle for a Senate seat representing Montgomery County recently played out in a hearing room in Annapolis. Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr., Maryland\u2019s only openly gay senator, is being challenged in the Democratic primary by Dana Beyer, who would become the first transgender person to serve in the legislature if elected. During the hearing, Madaleno was championing a bill that would make it illegal to discriminate against transgender people in workplace hiring, housing and public accommodations. He urged his colleagues to help a group of people \u201clive their lives as they feel they are.\u201d Beyer, the executive director of a transgender rights group, stood in the back of the room, her arms crossed, planning to testify in favor of the bill when given the opportunity. After a parade of other supporters was called to testify \u2014 including Mizeur, in her capacity as a candidate for governor \u2014 Beyer was finally summoned forward. Appearing visibly frustrated, she decided not to testify. Beyer later said that while she has been fighting for years to get such a bill passed in Annapolis, she did not want to participate in \u201cpolitical theater\u201d \u2014 a characterization Madaleno strongly disputed. Even the introduction of legislation has prompted charges of election-year politicking. Sen. Lisa A. Gladden (D-Baltimore) filed a bill that would make it a crime for a state or local official to direct law enforcement to use resources to personally benefit them. The legislation was widely assumed to be an attempt to embarrass Del. Jon S. Cardin (D-Baltimore County), a candidate for attorney general. In 2009, Cardin orchestrated a headline-grabbing marriage proposal that involved use of a Baltimore police helicopter and marine unit. This year, Cardin\u2019s opponents for higher office include Sen. Brian E. Frosh (D-Montgomery), chairman of the Judicial Proceedings Committee. Gladden is the committee\u2019s vice chairwoman. Gladden said her bill wasn\u2019t aimed specifically at Cardin. She has agreed to hold off pushing it until after the election, however. Asked about the bill, Cardin said he has a full legislative agenda this session and added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that I have time to play old and tired political games.\u201d Several bills are being pushed by more than one candidate this year. Both Brown and Gansler, for example, have said their priorities for the session include legislation that allows judges to give tougher sentences for acts of domestic violence committed in front of a child. Brown is leading the effort to pass a bill sponsored by O\u2019Malley for the first time this year. Gansler is backing \u2014 again \u2014 similar legislation sponsored by Del. Luiz R.S. Simmons (D-Montgomery). Simmons has tried for seven years to get his bill passed. Simmons said the administration had \u201cshown little or no interest\u201d in his bill in past years, but he added he is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the attention it is getting now. \u201cI don\u2019t care whose bill passes, but I would like to at least be acknowledged as the architect,\u201d Simmons said. Simmons is one of at least 10 House members running for the Senate, and he faces a highly competitive Democratic primary against former Montgomery delegate Cheryl Kagan. She has actively courted women\u2019s groups, among others, to back her candidacy. Gansler has questioned Brown\u2019s commitment to the legislation, saying his involvement this year appeared to be an attempt to \u201cembellish his credentials.\u201d \u201cBut his presence is certainly welcome,\u201d Gansler added. Brown said he has been heavily involved in legislation to combat domestic violence since the 2008 murder of a cousin by her estranged boyfriend. Each year since then, Brown said, he has consulted with advocates against domestic violence on how he could be most helpful. This session, they pointed him to this bill, he said.

It is an affliction, one that saps the life out of our democratic institutions, and it must be fiercely resisted if the nation as we know it is to survive. I wish that were hyperbole. The problem is not just that President Trump is selfish, insecure, egotistical, ignorant and unserious. It is that he neither fully grasps nor minimally respects the concept of honor, without which our governing system falls apart. He believes \u201chonorable\u201d means \u201cobsequious in the service of Trump.\u201d He believes everyone else\u2019s motives are as base as his. The Trump administration is, indeed, like the court of some accidental monarch who is tragically unsuited for the duties of his throne. However long it persists, we must never allow ourselves to think of the Trump White House as anything but aberrant. We must fight for the norms of American governance lest we forget them in their absence. It gets worse and worse. The past week has marked a succession of new lows. Trump has started a sustained campaign to goad or humiliate Attorney General Jeff Sessions into resigning. Trump has blasted Sessions on Twitter, at a news conference, in newspaper interviews and at a campaign-style rally. He has called Sessions \u201cbeleaguered\u201d and said repeatedly how \u201cdisappointed\u201d he is in the attorney general. Forget, for the moment, that Sessions was the first sitting U.S. senator to support Trump\u2019s campaign, giving him credibility among conservatives. Forget also that Sessions is arguably having more success than any other Cabinet member in getting Trump\u2019s agenda implemented. Those things aside, what kind of leader treats a lieutenant with such passive-aggressive obnoxiousness? Trump is too namby-pamby to look Sessions in the eye and say, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d That\u2019s what the president clearly is trying to summon the courage to do, however. The Post reported that Trump has been \u201cmusing\u201d with his courtiers about the possibility of firing Sessions and naming a replacement during the August congressional recess. Trump has no respect for the rule of law. He is enraged that Sessions recused himself from the investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, and thus is not in a position to protect the House of Trump from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. According to the New York Times, \u201cSharing the president\u2019s frustration have been people in his family, some of whom have come under scrutiny in the Russia investigation.\u201d I\u2019m guessing that means the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Who elected _them_ , by the way? Trump seeks to govern by whim and fiat. On Wednesday morning, he used Twitter to announce a ban on transgender people serving in the military, surprising his own top military leaders. A Pentagon spokesman told reporters to ask the White House for details; White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters to ask the Pentagon. Was Trump trying to reignite the culture wars? Would the thousands of transgender individuals now serving in the military be purged? Was this actual policy or just a fit of indigestion? Inside the mad king\u2019s court, the internecine battles are becoming ever more brutal. Members of Trump\u2019s inner circle seek his favor by leaking negative information about their rivals. This administration is more hostile to the media than any in recent memory but is also more eager to whisper juicy dirt about the ambitious courtier down the hall. Trump\u2019s new favorite, Anthony Scaramucci, struts around more like a chief of staff than a communications director, which is his nominal role. Late Wednesday night \u2014 after dining with Trump and his head cheerleader, Sean Hannity \u2014 Scaramucci took a metaphorical rapier to the actual chief of staff, Reince Priebus, by strongly hinting on Twitter that Priebus leaks to reporters. The next morning, Scaramucci told CNN that \u201cif Reince wants to explain that he\u2019s not a leaker, let him do that.\u201d And in a profanity-laden phone call to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza, Scaramucci called Priebus \u201ca f--- ing paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac.\u201d Why bring in Scaramucci? Because, I fear, the mad king is girding for war. Trump is reckless enough to fire Mueller if he digs too deeply into the business dealings of the Trump Organization and the Kushner Companies. What then? Will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) draft and push through a new special-prosecutor statute so that Mueller can quickly be reappointed? Will House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) immediately open debate on articles of impeachment? Will we, the people, defend our democracy? Do not become numb to the mad king\u2019s outrages. The worst is yet to come. _Read more fromEugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

The second renewal brought programs for teen victims of domestic and sexual abuse. This year, 61 senators have co-sponsored a reauthorization that would further improve the law\u2019s effectiveness and meet the changing needs of victims. Let\u2019s hope that bipartisan support \u2014 a fixture in the law\u2019s history \u2014 does not fall prey to presidential politics and the increasing stridency concerning which party best represents women\u2019s issues. Enacted in 1994, VAWA has twice been reauthorized by Congress with unanimous Senate support. This year Senate Republicans opposed the bill in the Judiciary Committee because of provisions that extend protections to gays, lesbians, transgendered people, Native Americans and battered immigrant women. They essentially accused Democrats of using the cloak of battered women to force approval on what they see as controversial social issues. \u201cMaybe then they could accuse you of not being supportive of fighting violence against women?\u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) told the New York Times. Mr. Sessions and other Republicans on the committee voted for an alternative version that they characterized as a clean reauthorization without unnecessarily political provisions. A comprehensive committee report convincingly details gaps in current programs as identified by law enforcement officers, victim-service providers, judges and health-care professions. No one \u2014 gay or straight, man or woman, legal or undocumented \u2014 should be denied protections against domestic abuse or sexual violence. The proposed changes are by no means radical. They include a provision that would bar a shelter from turning away a lesbian who has been beaten by her female partner and adjustments in funding formulas to better address the needs of male victims of domestic and sexual violence. Some changes, such as increasing the number of temporary visas for battered immigrant women, are supported by law enforcement. And the need to do more to protect Native American women is supported by a regional survey by University of Oklahoma researchers that showed that three out of five Native American women had been assaulted by their spouses or partners and a nationwide survey that found that one-third of all Native American women will be raped in their lifetime. The impact of this landmark law, as Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said last week in urging its passage, has been \u201cremarkable,\u201d with the annual incidence of domestic violence decreasing by more than 50 percent since its passage. In addition to addressing unmet needs, the bill consolidates programs and cuts the authorization level by more than $135 million a year, to $695 million. Democrats and the White House are right to push for approval. ****", "qid": 870, "docid": "64ec060c-88e0-11e1-97b9-0c8b2351aef5", "score": 11.908499717712402}, {"content": "Title: Trump\u2019s iceberg looms Content: Donald Trump had his worst day since he was elected president \u2014 we\u2019ll just call it Friday \u2014 and his worst week since the last one. Things can only get worser and worser, as the Bard would permit me to say. Let\u2019s start with the vote-a-rama and the \u201cskinny repeal,\u201d which puts me in mind of a state fair ride and placing an order at Starbucks. _I\u2019d like a skinny repeal, please \u2014 venti, with mocha_. As all know by now, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) didn\u2019t get the skinny on repeal and shocked the chamber by voting no with a thumbs-down. Not even with a Republican majority could Trump dump Obamacare in its slimmest version yet. McCain, who postponed treatment for aggressive brain cancer and flew to Washington to cast his vote, joined fellow Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, as well as all the Democratic members, to put the kibosh on any real hope of repeal this year, much less replace. In most ways, McCain\u2019s seemingly last-minute maneuver should have surprised no one. Always the maverick, McCain, who has defied death before, is no one\u2019s wingman. If he thought this vote might be his last stand in the arena, he would make it worthwhile and memorable. Back at the Ponderosa, Trump at least had a soul mate in whom to confide, Anthony Scaramucci, the White House\u2019s new communications director. \u201cMooch\u201d or \u201cMini-Me\u201d to Washington insiders, Scaramucci is Trump\u2019s kneecapper. Good cop, meet seriously bad cop. Scaramucci is the personification of Trump\u2019s deep brain. To the extent that the president ever withholds a thought, Scaramucci is there to express it for him. He\u2019s his human Twitter feed. Thus, we may assume that what Scaramucci says, Trump thinks. Thanks to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza, we\u2019re privy to enough premium quotes to entertain ourselves for months. As you may have heard, Scaramucci called Lizza on Wednesday in a rage over his \u201cleaked\u201d financial records and Lizza\u2019s reporting of an intimate Trump dinner that included Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who, sources say, told Trump that then-White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is a leaker. When Scaramucci demanded that Lizza divulge his source, Lizza, a polite, erudite fellow, declined and did what reporters sometimes do: He taped the conversation, capturing a hailstorm of profane tirades against leakers and, specifically, Priebus \u2014 \u201ca [expletive] paranoid schizophrenic.\u201d By late Friday afternoon, Priebus was out of a job, with Trump tweeting that he was replacing him with Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly. Next, we visit El Salvador, where, strangely, we find Attorney General Jeff Sessions. We know Trump wants to get rid of Sessions, but sending him into the maw of the beastly MS-13 gang seems excessively aggressive even for this president. While Poor Sessions (see previous column) was practicing Spanish for \u201cI have nothing against tattoos, but seriously?,\u201d Trump was making a play in Ohio for tighter immigration by focusing on the gang\u2019s murderous record. And, lest we ignore the gold coin Trump magically pulled from his ear, the president randomly ordered transgender people out of the military. What, no women bleeding this week? Health care, schmealth care, in other words. As buffer to the inevitable, Trump made sure to create a little sidebar drama \u2014 expelling thugs and transgender people, rooting out leakers and traitors, and threatening to fire anyone who says \u201cRussia\u201d in his presence. So many shiny objects, so few left to fool. A few Trump loyalists may wait for the last lifeboat, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before this administration capsizes, titanically. Trump\u2019s first-year agenda is DOA along with health-care reform. Going after Sessions has hurt the president with conservatives. His chaotic White House operation is a constant reminder that no one\u2019s in charge. The cumulative effect of all of these affronts to normalcy, decorum and democracy is to reveal the profile of a deadly iceberg off the ship of state\u2019s bow. _Light shifts to a small lifeboat off in the distance_. Rowing slowly is an old man whose posture betrays a straight spine despite obvious injury to his arms and shoulders. A smile creases his face as moonlight catches a twinkle in his eye. A deep scar above it imitates a wryly arched brow. He chuckles at the memory of Trump saying he was a war hero only because he was captured and turns to make yet another final gesture. This time, he doesn\u2019t use his thumb. _Read more fromKathleen Parker\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or find her on Facebook._ **Read more on this topic:** The Post\u2019s View: This is not okay Dana Milbank: What do we do if Trump really is insane?

But who has the patience for that now, when every week feels like a year and Monday is a blur by Friday? Last week, July 24 to 28, was a news and spectacle avalanche. The White House press secretary had just resigned. It was Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s first day. The president was at Twitter-war with his own attorney general. Along with Jared Kushner\u2019s closed-door testimony, and a bizarro Boy Scout Jamboree, and pants-wetting news from North Korea, and the dramatic return of a cancer-stricken John McCain, and, and, and. So we tried to wrap our arms around each bonkers news cycle and re-create for posterity what it was like to be alive for just one week in 2017. Presenting: An oral history of the Era of the Mooch \u2014 condensed and edited for clarity \u2014 as told by senators, Boy Scouts, soldiers, journalists, parents, talking heads, Wall Street traders and the CEO of an arcade-game company in Florida. _The White House\u2019s \u201cAmerican Heroes Week\u201d starts, and at 8:49 a.m. \u2014 as Kushner is about to testify \u2014 the president calls Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u201cbeleaguered\u201d on Twitter._ **Kat Timpf, Fox News host and libertarian columnist:** We were talking a lot about Jeff Sessions and that whole situation is kind of, you know \u2014 we\u2019ve never seen anything like that before. What\u2019s. Happening. **Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union and Trump surrogate:** So much happened last week, it\u2019s hard to even know where to start. **Max Boot, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations:** His weekly Saturday-morning meltdown was especially severe this week. You\u2019re just trying to catch up, and then I\u2019m catching up to the reactions to the tweets. It\u2019s like being woken up with a pitcher of water on my face every morning. **Robin Springer, **Trump supporter and arcade-game dealer in Yulee, Fla.** :** I\u2019m mad at him for getting on Jeff Sessions. I have no problem with raking someone over the coals, but it needs to be done in private. Jeff Sessions \u2014 what a nice man. _In the afternoon the president departs for West Virginia to speak atthe quadrennial Boy Scouts Jamboree._ **Eli Stokols, Wall Street Journal:** I was the pool reporter on duty the day of the Boy Scout Jamboree. We rolled to the Jamboree down this dirt road and came upon an amphitheater. **Jarren Cook, 15, Scout from West Virginia:** I\u2019ve been in Scouts for 10 years. I\u2019m doing my Eagle project building benches at a state park. That morning was pretty calm. . . . They gave us boxed dinners with turkey sandwiches and fig bars. **David Bender, 15, Scout from Indiana:** Secret Service had shut down the whole area. We had to go through security. I was in my seat by 2:30. **Stokols:** You didn\u2019t realize until you walked into the amphitheater that it was like a giant campaign rally. These are probably the biggest crowds he\u2019s seen since Inauguration Day. And knowing how Trump feeds off of crowds \u2014 you know this is now going to be a thing. **David:** I know the speeches aren\u2019t supposed to be political. I was hoping to hear how we can help our communities and embody Scouting values. When he said, Who the hell wants to talk about politics? \u2014 I wish you could have seen my face cheer up. **Stokols:** When he said, \u201cWho the hell wants to speak about politics?\u201d it was an immediate red flashing light to me that things were about to get political. _The president proceeds to deliver an address lambasting the \u201cfake news media\u201d and the Washington \u201ccesspool.\u201d He joked about firing his health and human services secretary \u2014 who was onstage with him. He told a meandering story about yachts. And he sneered at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama._ **Jarren:** What he did was, he said, \u201cDid Barack Obama ever come to a jamboree?\u201d And we all said, \u201cNooooo!\u201d Because he had never came to a jamboree. A president should take the time to support Boy Scouts. **David:** When he said, \u201cBarack Obama,\u201d I screamed \u201cOh my God,\u201d and put my hands over my head. It was so unreal. I thought I was in a dream. He got the crowd to boo. It made me so sad. **Jarren:** I remember when he said not to lose momentum on anything you do. It reminded me to never give up. **Timpf** : It\u2019s a strange thing to use your time in front of tens of thousands of teenagers to brag about your election win and your partying days in New York. **Stokols:** When you\u2019re covering a speech like that, it\u2019s like a microcosm of covering the whole presidency. You\u2019re just treading water \u2014 you\u2019ll fixate on one thing that\u2019s kind of wild and then you\u2019ll miss something else. I missed the \u201cUnder the Trump administration you\u2019ll be saying \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 again when you go shopping\u201d thing because I was so busy trying to make sense of the yacht story. **David:** There were disagreements all over camp. Some people saying \u201cF Trump,\u201d some people saying \u201cMAGA.\u201d I heard there was a troop from New York that had a troop from Texas right next to them and the leaders had to keep them separate. **Jarren:** I went back and charged my phone on a solar charger. Then I organized my tent, and we took our showers by 9:30 because quiet time was at 10. _The day starts with another Twitter drubbing of Sessions._ _The Senate is scheduled for a procedural vote on whether to proceed with a vote to repeal Obamacare \u2014 which would then be held later in the week._ _Republicans could afford to lose only three votes for the repeal to move forward, and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had not yet returned from an operation to removethe brain tumor discovered the week before._ **Julie Rovner, chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health News:** This was the moment when it really started to feel insane. It was abundantly clear there would be a vote, and equally abundantly clear that nobody knew what they were going to vote on. **Alice Ollstein, political reporter for Talking Points Memo:** I was inside the chamber scribbling in my notebook when all of a sudden these protesters in white lab coats stood up. **Paul Davis, protester and coordinator of national advocacy for Housing Works:** Only the medical personnel were in white lab coats. We were mostly religious leaders and medical personnel. There were about 150 of us who marched from a Lutheran church to the Capitol. **Ollstein:** They started chanting, \u201cKill the bill, don\u2019t kill us.\u201d **Rovner:** There was a thought that McCain might come back to kill the bill. That he might show up and vote \u201cno\u201d on the motion to proceed. It sounds so cliche, but you could cut the tension with a knife. **Jesse Ferguson, former press aide for the Hillary Clinton campaign:** I wanted to see if we were going to be able to stop this thing before it even started. Spoiler alert: We couldn\u2019t. _McCain voted for the motion and then gavea speech about the dysfunction and \u201cdecline\u201d of the Senate, pleading for bipartisanship and a \u201creturn to order.\u201d_ **Senate GOP aide:** The thing that was most well-received from his speech was somebody finally told this ecosystem of media outlets on talk radio and Fox News \u2014 cables news in general \u2014 to just stuff it, right? I dunno, maybe it takes a cancer diagnosis to put things in perspective. **Democratic Senate aide:** He was so passionate and so vehement. He was calling bulls--- on everyone, and a pox on everyone\u2019s house, and he was right. We really are not working together. **Ferguson:** How did I feel about his vote? You think I still have feelings? Those died a long time ago. **Rovner:** I started in 1986. I think this bill is the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. _Also on Tuesday_ , _the Defense Intelligence Agency reports that North Korea will be able to launch a viable intercontinental ballistic missile next year \u2014 two years sooner than expected._ **Melissa Hanham, North Korea expert at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies:** Our Slack channel\u2019s divided into countries and into regions and into grant proposals, and \u2014 you probably can\u2019t print this, but we literally have a channel called \u201cF--- F--- F---.\u201d That is our channel for venting frustrating about how important this subject is, and why is no one paying attention to it? Or about the crazy thing that happened in Washington that day, or about why is life like this in 2017? _At 3:22 p.m., news breaks that Secretary of Energy Rick Perry had recently spent 22 minutes on the phone witha Russian prankster posing as the prime minister of Ukraine._ ____ __At_ 4 p.m., the S&P; 500 closes at a record high as earnings beat Wall Street estimates._ **Springer, the Trump supporter in Yulee, Fla.:** In eight years under Obama [my business] didn\u2019t do great but in just the past six months my business has picked up dramatically. I think it\u2019s optimism, just like the stock market. The stock market\u2019s not based on any real facts. I think it\u2019s optimism. **Kenny Polcari** **, managing director of O\u2019Neil Securities, on the floor of the NYSE** : The circus going on in D.C. is just that. It\u2019s a circus, and it\u2019s entertainment, but the market is not reacting. It\u2019s enjoying what it\u2019s seeing. It\u2019s laughing along. But the market is not pricing itself on whether Jared is colluding the Russians or Scaramucci is hired as the new communications director. _The president flies toYoungstown, Ohio, to appear at an evening campaign- style rally at the Covelli Centre, which holds 7,000 \u2014 a third as many people as requested tickets._ **** ****John McNally, Democratic mayor of Youngstown:** ** I want to say it had a sort of concert type feel to it, or a traveling carnival as well. . . . He comes out with Mrs. Trump and the crowd went crazy. From the time he got in there till the time he left, nobody sat down. ****Henry Gomez, BuzzFeed political reporter based in Cleveland** : **At one point, when he was ragging on the media, all the supporters turned to the press pen where I was sitting and chanted, \u201cCNN sucks, CNN sucks.\u201d **McNally:** He talked about our steel mills and that those jobs are coming back, and I\u2019m not quite sure anybody was buying into it. . . . My finance director had come in and was standing next to me, and I think we just both looked at each other like, \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d _The country woke to Donald Trump tweeting that he wasbanning transgender individuals from serving in the military._ **Sarah McBride, press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign:** The tweets arrived as people were just getting to the office. I was on my phone, just leaving my apartment. There were probably 50 new emails in my inbox by the time I got to the office. **Aaron Belkin, executive director of the Palm Center, a research institute studying sexual minorities in the military:** I was visiting my parents in Cleveland. They are Trump voters who said when the president was elected that he would never discriminate against transgender people. I woke up that morning, turned on the television and saw what he had done, and just burst into tears. **Jacob Eleazer, a transgender Army Reserve captain in Lexington, Ky.** : I was completely floored. **Belkin:** My parents read the news in their room, and they came out and kept apologizing. I didn\u2019t ask them to apologize, but they did. They kept saying how sorry they are. **Springer, the Trump supporter in Yulee, Fla.:** I was driving down the road \u2014 from Florida to Georgia, to take care of some customers \u2014 and I got the pop- up alert and I thought, \u201cFantastic! Finally!\u201d This is reversing one of President Obama\u2019s decisions [and] I like the reversal of the morality of this. . . . I\u2019m just a traditional man and I like traditional. **Senate GOP aide:** Essentially, tactically, you\u2019ve now made [trans troops] the No. 1 issue for Senate floor debate, when what you\u2019re trying to do is rebuild the military. **Eleazer:** We had servicemembers across the world who were panicking. . . . Our next reaction, because we\u2019re servicemembers, is: What are we going to do about it? Let\u2019s get some intel and move out. _The daily press briefing at the White House begins a bit after 2 p.m., and journalists are primed to ask about the tweets on transgender servicemembers. Before taking questions, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reads aloud a letter from a 9-year-old Trump fan nicknamed Pickle._ **Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House press secretary:** \u201cMy name is Dylan Harbin, but everybody calls me Pickle. I\u2019m 9 years old, and you\u2019re my favorite president. I like you so much that I had a birthday about you. My cake was the shape of your hat.\u201d **Olivia Nuzzi, Washington correspondent for New York magazine:** I let out an exhausted sigh so loud that Evan McMorris-Santoro from Vice, who was in front of me, turned around and laughed. **Evan McMorris-Santoro:** I thought it was a masterstroke of White House communications strategy. . . . All the press corps wants is the [presser] to be on TV. So the White House, in true Trumpian fashion says . . . \u201cIf you want a TV show, we\u2019ll give you a f---ing TV show.\u201d **** **Nuzzi:** It reminded me of when Bill O\u2019Reilly used to take reader emails and they\u2019d all be like: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how someone as smart as you has to deal with idiots all day.\u201d But this one was from a child. One of the questions was: \u201cHow much money do you have?\u201d Which to me was a clue that Donald Trump wrote this with his left hand. I think Pickle broke me. It\u2019s so insane. So completely deranged. _Trump dines at the White House with Sean Hannity, Scaramucci, Melania Trump and Bill Shine, a former Fox News executive. News of the dinner promptly leaks, and Scaramucci tweets what appears to be a veiled threat at White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus_. _Later that night, Scaramucci calls the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza to determine how news of the dinner got out, as later recounted by Lizza._ **Scaramucci to Lizza:** I ask these guys not to leak anything and they can\u2019t help themselves. You\u2019re an American citizen, this is a major catastrophe for the American country. So I\u2019m asking you as an American patriot to give me a sense of who leaked it. . . . Is it an assistant to the president? _Lizza refuses to say._ **Scaramucci:** Okay, I\u2019m going to fire every one of them, and then you haven\u2019t protected anybody, so the entire place will be fired over the next two weeks. . . . I\u2019ll get to the person who leaked that to you. [White House chief of staff] Reince Priebus \u2014 if you want to leak something \u2014 he\u2019ll be asked to resign very shortly. . . . I\u2019ve called the FBI and the Department of Justice. **Lizza:** Are you serious? **Scaramucci:** The swamp will not defeat him. They\u2019re trying to resist me, but it\u2019s not going to work. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong on my financial disclosures, so they\u2019re going to have to go f--- themselves. _This is the day the Senate is headed for a vote to repeal Obamacare._ **Ben Wikler, Washington director of Move\u00adOn.org:** I woke up with just a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. It felt like this is the day when we lose. _But the news cycle really starts with Scaramucci calling in to CNN, at 7:09 a.m., as Lizza is on the air with anchors Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota._ **Yashar Ali, New York magazine and HuffPost contributor:** Scaramucci starts saying things that are just unbelievable. He says that the president says if you\u2019re nice to me, I can come back on [CNN]. Then he said, \u201cI told the president I can\u2019t afford to be a sycophant to you, sir.\u201d Then he did a whole attack of the CIA and the intelligence community. Then he quoted Joe Paterno. **Noah Bookbinder, executive director for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington:** I don\u2019t know that anybody [in the office] saw the interview live, but people saw the Twitter accounts of it, and there was definitely conversation of, \u201cDid that really happen or was someone making this up on Twitter?\u201d **Ali:** I just kept thinking, \u201cI cannot believe that the White House communications director is behaving this way.\u201d . . . It was almost like a call-in on the radio. Like, someone who is angry on a radio show, like Howard Stern. Whenever you listen to those call-in shows you\u2019re always cringing, and there\u2019s part of you that wants to change the channel because you\u2019re embarrassed for them. _At 4:58 p.m., Ryan Lizza publishesa story on NewYorker.com that recounts his curse-laden conversation with Scaramucci the previous night. By the 6 o\u2019clock hour, chyrons on CNN were including Scaramucci quotations like \u201cF-----G PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC,\u201d in reference to Priebus, and \u201cI\u2019M NOT TRYING TO S**K MY OWN [EXPLETIVE],\u201d a reference to Scaramucci\u2019s putdown of Trump adviser Steve Bannon._ **Tommy Vietor, former Obama spokesperson:** [Former Obama speechwriter] Jon Favreau and I had recently finished recording our Thursday podcast when the story with Ryan Lizza and the Mooch popped up. . . . This was just the latest example of huge breaking news happening every time we finish a show. I click through and am just flabbergasted. . . . We grabbed [fellow Obama alum Jon] Lovett and read him some choice lines. He couldn\u2019t believe it was real. How can this be real? **McMorris-Santoro:** It was a one-man play of a Wall Street guy arriving in Washington. It was a summary of Trump\u2019s 180 days in one conversation. **Vietor:** Can you imagine Dan Pfeiffer calling Ryan Lizza and saying he\u2019s not trying to suck his own d--- like David Axelrod? **Matt Schlapp, Trump surrogate:** I was driving with Viana, my oldest daughter. She\u2019s going to be in high school next year. I looked at my Twitter at a red light and saw a story was getting tweeted out. I said to Viana, \u201cOh, my God, look at this story, will you read this out loud to me?\u201d Then I looked for one half minute and said, \u2018Oh no, thank you, you cannot read this out loud!\u2019 I believe in guardian angels and I believe one interceded in that moment. _The Senate gathers Thursday evening to vote on the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R- Alaska) are ready to vote \u201cno\u201d with the Democrats \u2014 leaving McCain as a possible third \u201cno\u201d vote that would sink McConnell\u2019s effort. Everyone was trying to read the tea leaves, both inside the Capitol and outside, where a few hundred protesters gathered._ **Wikler, MoveOn.org:** We marched over to the Capitol. The sky looked ominous and gray. Even midweek, we put McConnell\u2019s ultimate chance at success at 8 in 10, or 9 in 10. I had the image of the repeal bill as the liquid metal T-1000 from \u201cTerminator,\u201d that it could change shape and pour itself through the tiniest crack and reform itself on the other side. One way or another, it seemed like it was on track to becoming law. **Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.):** My head was telling me McConnell had the votes, and my gut was telling me he didn\u2019t. **Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.)** : Mitch McConnell comes and introduces the bill on the floor. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) asked me to kick off the Democratic hour of debate, and that\u2019s when I said the process was \u201cnuclear-grade bonkers.\u201d **Sen. Tim Scott: (R-S.C.):** Have you ever been on one of those roller coasters where it\u2019s cranking up to get to the top? The energy and the pressure was building and we knew the V.P. is coming back to break the tie, hopefully . . . and the anticipation is growing. _The floor speeches continue past midnight into Friday._ **Murphy:** When I got to the floor around midnight, I had a sense something very interesting was going to happen. **Wikler:** When Mike Pence pulled up in his motorcade . . . we turned and ran to the wall at the edge of the lawn and started chanting \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d **Collins:** Originally I had thought Vice President Pence had come over to break the tie and allow the bill to proceed. But it then became obvious that he was there to talk to Sen. McCain. **Kaine:** I think five or six of us on our side had figured out maybe McCain was with us, but that didn\u2019t mean that Murkowski and Collins were with us. They\u2019d been with us all along, but they were under enormous pressure. **Collins:** All of us were chitchatting, and reminiscing \u2014 talking about travels with John [McCain]. Then the conversation turned to health care. The vice president said to me, \u201cBoy, are you tough,\u201d but then he softened it by putting his arm around me. **Kaine:** It was interesting to watch the groups of people over there with Senator McCain, because the tension level in their faces was increasing. **Scott** : All of a sudden I looked down from the roller coaster, and I started noticing that on my side, I could feel the shift in the room. We were happy when we left, we were energetic, but the faster we got to the top, we realized the steep fall wasn\u2019t going to be what we thought it was going to be, not a thrilling ride, but instead a really scary drop. **Collins:** It felt tense and somber to me. I was cognizant of the fact that because of where my name falls, I would be the first Republican to cast a no vote. I know John very well. I know he has the courage to do what\u2019s right, regardless of whether it\u2019s difficult or unpopular. **Scott** : Things had changed. McCain was chatting with the Democrats. They were having a good time, and we were already on the decline. **Murphy** : I was standing in the aisle, watching the vote. I\u2019ve seen John do that motion a million times. He waves to get the clerk\u2019s attention with an arm that\u2019s still damaged from his time as a POW. When he did it this time there was a gasp. **Kaine** : The clerk was not looking at McCain, who was standing with his arm straight out. It was like the scene from \u201cGladiator\u201d with Russell Crowe: Do you survive, or not? **Wikler:** The moment I read \u201cMcCain no,\u201d the crowd exploded. We were literally jumping up and down, picking up and hugging total strangers. **Scott** : I had been looking forward to doing the right thing and honoring campaign promises. It was anticlimactic after that. I sat in my car, feeling dejection. **Collins** : After the vote, I waited a while for things to empty out, because I didn\u2019t want to get caught in the crush of the press. After a while I saw Lindsey Graham and asked, is there a way I can get out of here where I can just go to my car? Lindsey and I tried to go out a side door and promptly set off an alarm. **Vietor:** I feel like I say this every week, but last week was unique. **Schlapp** : It was more of a jampacked week than normal. Every time something else interesting happened, everyone started calling to know what it all meant, and what they should expect. I don\u2019t even want to calculate how much time I spent on the phone. **Boot:** It\u2019s basically just trying to shoot the rapids and stay afloat. But you\u2019re constantly picking up speed, and it\u2019s hard to slow down because the deluge of crazy news emanating from the White House is just unceasing, unstopping, relentless and overwhelming. **Schlapp:** When you\u2019re a Trump supporter, getting bogged down in one speech or one decision is not something you do. You end up looking at what\u2019s happening to the agenda and whether the president is learning the art of politics. I think he\u2019s a fast learner and is making some of the changes he needs to make. **Senate GOP aide** : [After this week it\u2019s] going to be exactly like World War I. Everybody\u2019s settled into their trenches, they\u2019re gonna blow the s--- out of each other for four years until somebody wins \u2014 and even if they win, everything\u2019s gonna be so f----- up that even the winner\u2019s not a winner. And then who knows what happens in 2020. _Epilogue.

As a result of the plea bargain, the trial will not go forward. The original post is below._ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Islan Nettles was just walking down the street moments before her life came to a brutal halt. She and two friends, also transgender women, were making their way along a street in New York\u2019s Harlem in 2013 when they encountered a group of around seven men. The two parties soon got into a dispute, according to police reports, and Nettles was slammed to the ground. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A series of relentless blows left the 21-year-old African American comatose, her face battered beyond recognition. The following week, she died. Immediately, reports swirled about the circumstances of Nettles\u2019s slaying \u2014 allegedly, the violence had begun after the men learned she was transgender, and homophobic slurs were uttered as she crumpled to the ground \u2014 and transgender activists were galvanized. It appeared that, once again, another transgender woman of color had been targeted, this time to fatal effect. For all the transgender women who had long feared the demise that Nettles suffered, her death confirmed what they already knew: that their identities meant security was far from assured. \u201cIslan isn\u2019t the first death of a transgender woman of color, and she\u2019s not going to be the last,\u201d transgender writer and activist Janet Mock told Out Magazine. \u201cI\u2019m at risk every day myself just walking the streets of New York City. We all are.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico More than two and a half years since Nettles was beaten to death, the case against her accused killer is finally going to trial. Jury selection begins on Monday, as the transgender community awaits what they see as an overdue reckoning for attacks against all transgender women of color. At a rally outside of the courtroom last Thursday, LGBT advocate Lala Zannell told NBC that the trial will reverberate beyond this one case. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s more than just a verdict,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting visibility out there that New Yorkers aren\u2019t going to stand for folks doing violence against us.\u201d This hope speaks to the heartrending irony of progress for transgender women in recent years. As their experiences garnered unprecedented attention through the likes of actress Laverne Cox and former athlete Caitlyn Jenner, they were also being killed in numbers greater than ever before. The National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs told the Associated Press that last year saw the highest recorded tally of murders of transgender or gender-nonconforming people. In November, the count was 22 \u2014 nearly double last year\u2019s 12 and 2013\u2019s 13. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Alicia Garza, who coined the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d called the spate of violence against black transgender people \u201can incredible epidemic.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney, told the AP that \u201cthere\u2019s a sense [among perpetrators] of transgender people being less than human.\u201d For supporters of Nettles, this sentiment seemed to be compounded in the slow pace at which her case was investigated. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t a detective come to the hospital?\u201d Nettles\u2019s mother, Delores Nettles, said through a megaphone at a protest in 2014. \u201cA social worker there had to call the DA\u2019s office. I said to them, \u2018Half of my child\u2019s brain is hanging out of her head and you can\u2019t tell me anything?'\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A 20-year-old Harlem man who was present at the beating, Paris Wilson, was arrested shortly after the event, but charges against him were dropped months later. It wasn\u2019t until last March that James Dixon, 25, was charged with first-degree manslaughter. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico His trial began last week with a hearing on a taped confession. In the recording, which was played in court, Dixon told police officers that he had succumbed to \u201ca blind fury\u201d after his friends started teasing him for flirting with a transgender woman. \u201cI just remember lashing out,\u201d he said in the confession, according to the New York Times. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Dixon said he and his friends had been drinking that night, and were headed to a party uptown. Then he encountered Nettles and her friends, and crossed the street to talk to Nettles without realizing that she was transgender. \u201cI remember asking her what is her name, where are you from,\u201d Dixon told authorities. \u201cThat\u2019s how I roll up.\u201d His friends started mocking him, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a guy,\u201d and Dixon said he was angered because \u201cThey were clowning me.\u201d He said something similar had happened days before, when he inadvertently flirted with two transgender women and was ridiculed by his friends. While Dixon had turned himself in and volunteered this confession three days after the beating, police were initially skeptical of his sometimes contradictory accounts, the Times reported. They worried the confession was false. His lawyer argued that the confession was not, indeed a real confession, and unsuccessfully sought to have it suppressed, fearing that its release would prejudice potential jurors, according to VICE\u2019s Broadly. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Dixon\u2019s actions since he was charged last year, two years after he first confessed, have also contradicted his statements at the time. According to news reports, Dixon opted to go to trial thinking he might get a better result than he could from a plea bargain. He has pleaded not guilty to the manslaughter and related charges, and told DNAinfo shortly after his arrest that he wasn\u2019t even at the attack. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for the family\u2019s loss, but they got the wrong guy,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone.\u201d According to Dixon, he was back at his aunt\u2019s house by midnight. Prosecutors say the beating took place at 12:20 a.m. \u201cI can tell the difference between a man and a woman,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything against gay people or transgender people\u2026I don\u2019t just go pick fights with random people I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s not me.\u201d In his confession, Dixon also denied hurling gay slurs at Nettles as she was beaten. Nettles\u2019s mom, Delores, and trans activists had called on Dixon to be charged with a hate crime to no avail. Lourdes Hunter, the director of the Trans Women of Color Collective, told the Times that the long delay in bringing charges, the fact that he was charged with manslaughter as opposed to murder, and the absence of hate crime charges indicated that police consider transgender killings a low priority. \u201cReally this was murder,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cHe intentionally pummeled her to death,\u201d and the only motive that has been suggested is her sexual orientation. Nettles\u2019s friends and family told the Times that she had just started going public with her gender identity when she was killed. Following years of poverty, Nettles had gotten a job at H&M, was starting her own fashion line and had moved into her own apartment. \u201cShe was finally going to start living her life,\u201d Daequan Andino, a friend and fashion mentor, told the Times. \u201cEvery time I saw her in the street, I was like, \u2018Girl, you are doing it.'\u201d **More from Morning Mix** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Joe Medicine Crow, a war chief, historian and the last link to the Battle of Big Horn, dies at 102 *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Hello! magazine apologizes for \u2018completely fabricated\u2019 \u2018exclusive interview\u2019 with George Clooney *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "qid": 870, "docid": "25617c99948974fc70ac9815c81b772f", "score": 11.632499694824219}, {"content": "Title: It\u2019s time to start thinking about the unthinkable Content: If President Trump ordered a senior government official to support the firing of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, how should that person respond? Adm. Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, answered my question about such a problem onstage last week at the Aspen Security Forum. He began with a caveat that he wouldn\u2019t answer a hypothetical, so it shouldn\u2019t be taken as a direct comment on Mueller, but he did offer a personal statement that brought spontaneous applause: \u201cI will not violate the oath I have taken in my 36 years as a commissioned officer.\u201d He said that he regularly reminds NSA employees to recall their own oaths and ask themselves: \u201cWhy are we here? What are we about? What is it that we are defending? . . . I won\u2019t sacrifice that for anyone.\u201d In Trump\u2019s Washington, it\u2019s a fact of life that officials must now weigh whether they would follow presidential orders that might be improper or illegal. Officials mull (and occasionally, discuss quietly) what to do if a presidential request for loyalty conflicts with their sense of right and wrong. A possible order to fire Mueller is an imminent concern, but there are other tests of loyalty and conscience that could arise with this impulsive, policy- by-Twitter chief executive. Take Trump\u2019s proclamation Wednesday that transgender people shouldn\u2019t serve in the military. This apparently caught the Pentagon by surprise and contradicted a wait-and-see statement by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. How should he and his generals respond to the president\u2019s edict? Mattis and his commanders must also ponder how they would react to an impulsive order to conduct military action somewhere. Can they say no to the commander in chief? Presidential orders cannot ordinarily be ignored or dismissed. Our system gives the commander in chief extraordinary power. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard University law professor and former assistant attorney general, explained in an email: \u201cA subordinate in the executive branch has a presumptive duty to carry out the command of the president. If one doesn\u2019t want to for any reason, one can resign \u2014 or refuse the order and face a strong likelihood of being fired.\u201d For a military officer, the standard is even tougher. Soldiers must obey orders unless they\u2019re unlawful. Under our system of civilian control, if the president issues an order (as on transgender soldiers), the military\u2019s default response is to carry it out. Courts may find the presidential order to have been unconstitutional, but the military cannot make its own policy or law. How should Congress and Justice Department officials weigh their choices as Trump threatens openly to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, presumably to clear the way for firing Mueller? It\u2019s useful to think about the unthinkable \u2014 as a way of surfacing, and hopefully preventing, abuse of power. Let\u2019s start with Justice. Because Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, an order to fire Mueller, for now, would go to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein \u2014 who has strongly indicated that he would refuse. In June, members of the Senate Appropriations Committee got this commitment: \u201cI am not going to follow any orders unless I believe those are lawful and appropriate orders. Special counsel Mueller may be fired only for good cause, and I am required to put that cause in writing.\u201d Can Congress obtain similar pledges from other senior officials of the Justice Department who would be in the chain of command? During the Watergate scandal, Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy, William Ruckelshaus, felt bound by the commitments they had given Congress not to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox. A similar chain of obligation should be forged now, to circumscribe Trump\u2019s ability to sack Mueller. Given the expectation that Rosenstein (and probably others) would quit rather than fire Mueller, the White House seems to be thinking about installing a new attorney general who wouldn\u2019t have the recusal problem and could be counted on to fire Trump\u2019s nemesis. Members of Congress are said to be gaming this option, thinking of ways to block a recess appointment or to extract a promise from any Sessions successor to leave Mueller alone. That\u2019s another good firewall. Protecting Mueller by statute may be impossible because of the constitutional separation of powers. If he is fired, though, Congress could enact a new independent counsel law, at least providing the authority needed for a continuing investigation that would get to the truth of what happened. In dealing with this administration, lawmakers and other officials can\u2019t wait until the bomb detonates; they should begin to take precautions now. _Read more fromDavid Ignatius\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ **Read more on this issue:** Ruth Marcus: Dear Jeff Sessions: Please don\u2019t resign Kenneth Starr: Mr. President, please cut it out The Post\u2019s View: By firing Mueller, Trump would make a stronger case that he is obstructing justice David E.

More significantly, the day the tea party revolution ended and Washington began the return to \u201cregular order.\u201d The coup de gr\u00e2ce came at 1:30 a.m. on the Senate floor as John McCain became the third Republican to break ranks and defeat the third attempt to repeal Obamacare, which embodied the Democrats\u2019 promise that all Americans could \u2014 and should \u2014 have health insurance at a price they can afford. It was, as tea party Republicans had warned, another expensive government entitlement that, once granted, could never be taken away. Now McCain had acknowledged that political reality. Although it appeared to fall short by a single vote in the Senate, that was always going to be the margin of defeat for the seven-year effort to repeal Obamacare that had become the centerpiece of the tea party revolt. There were as many as 10 Republicans who had acknowledged that the proposal cobbled together at the last minute by the Republican leadership was so bad that, earlier in the day, they had demanded assurances from the House of Representatives that it would never become law. It was left to McCain, however, to do the deed so the others could protect themselves from the retribution of party leaders or the wrath of tea party voters in the next Republican primary. Having just been diagnosed with brain cancer, the senior senator from Arizona had achieved that state of political liberation where he no longer had to worry about such things. McCain was joined in his \u201cno\u201d vote by Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who earlier in the week had received a call from the secretary of the interior warning that the administration would drop its support for expanded energy drilling and road construction in Alaska if she dared to defy the president and Republican leadership on the crucial vote. Murkowski did not take well to being muscled in that ham-handed fashion. As chair of the two relevant committees, she announced that she was indefinitely postponing sessions to consider nominations to Interior\u2019s top positions and to mark up its 2018 appropriations. The collapse of the Obamacare repeal effort was hardly the only evidence of the waning influence of Trump and his tea party supporters. In the hours before the vote, the attorney general of the United States had defiantly declared that he had no intention of acceding to White House requests that he resign and dared the president to fire him. \u201cIf he wants to make a change, he can certainly do so,\u201d Jeff Sessions told Fox News. The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, urged on by several Republican colleagues, had already warned the Republican president that anyone appointed to replace Sessions would not receive a confirmation hearing. And senators of both parties had indicated that they would use parliamentary sleight of hand to keep the Senate in formal session through the normal summer recess to prevent Trump from replacing Sessions with a recess appointment. Earlier in the day, military and civilian leaders at the Pentagon indicated they would \u201cstudy\u201d what to do about transgender members of the armed forces after the commander in chief had tweeted that they would no longer be allowed to serve. And at the White House, the long-running tong war among members of the president\u2019s top staff finally broke out into the open, as the new communications chief let loose with a profanity-laced rant against a chief of staff whom he characterized as a paranoid schizophrenic leaker and chief strategist who spent his days engaged in political self-fellatio. Hoping to demonstrate, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that the business of government was proceeding apace, the White House and the Republican leadership of the House and Senate issued a five-paragraph \u201cstatement of principles\u201d for a long-promised reform of the tax code. Months in the making, the statement was a nothing-burger of political and economic platitudes that failed to resolve the central challenge of reducing tax rates without reducing tax revenue and exploding the federal deficit. This is a Waterloo moment for Trump, the tea party and their alliance. They have been stopped in their tracks not only by Democratic opposition but because of a mutiny within their own ranks. Although never particularly liked or respected, it is now clear that they are no longer feared. The bankruptcy of their ideas and their incompetence have been exposed. Their momentum has been dissipated. Their rejection of political norms has itself been scorned.

She became content to live out her retirement quietly, for the first time in her life as a woman, with her wife and dogs in the relative isolation of Deadwood, S.D. That is, until February. The South Dakota legislature advanced a bill requiring transgender students to use the bathroom matching the sex on their birth certificates. When an organizer with a national gay rights group called to see if she would come forward to call for the governor to veto the bill, requiring her to push herself into the limelight in a way she never imagined, she didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cAll my life, I put myself in harm\u2019s way because I couldn\u2019t be who I was,\u201d said Balentine, 49, a retired Marine and deputy sheriff who fully transitioned from living as a man to a woman last year. \u201cI decided now I was willing to die for who I am and fight for those who didn\u2019t have a voice.\u201d Balentine is part of a new wave of transgender people stepping out of the shadows to fight a surge in state bills requiring people to use the bathrooms, locker rooms and dressing rooms that differ from their gender identity \u2014 measures they consider unnecessary, dangerous and rooted in offensive stereotypes. Many, like Balentine, have been recruited for the spotlight by national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights groups, scrambling to address a critical weak spot in their broader fight for rights: the country\u2019s unfamiliarity with transgender people. This small but visible group has emerged as the newest target, say gay rights activists, of conservatives who want to slow the momentum of last year, when the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry. After that landmark victory, activists moved to expand LGBT rights by pushing for local and state protections against discrimination. Their opponents seized on one singular outcome of the proposed expansion: the bathroom issue. By arguing that nondiscrimination measures will permit biological males to enter women\u2019s bathrooms, they have found a message that resonates with a broader cross-section of voters than measures that target same-sex marriage, which more than half of Americans now support. The most stark example of that resonance came last fall, when Houston, a diverse and Democratic-leaning city that, at that time, was led by a gay mayor, voted overwhelmingly to repeal a nondiscrimination ordinance that opponents said would lead to male sexual predators gaining access to sex-segregated spaces. \u201cI think it makes common sense to voters that they don\u2019t want men to use women\u2019s locker, shower or bathroom facilities,\u201d said Mat Staver, chairman of the Liberty Counsel, which has endorsed the bathroom bills. \u201cThe transgender agenda could be, and I think is becoming, the Achilles\u2019 heel of the gay and lesbian movement.\u201d Cognizant that bathroom bills imperil broader rights for all LGBT people, the gay rights movement is shifting much of its formidable organizational machinery to focus on transgender issues. Groups are rallying large companies and celebrities who long ago signed on to gay rights to vocally oppose laws that they view as targeting transgender people. They are diverting millions of dollars to campaigns that depict transgender people as ordinary Americans deserving of dignity and legal protections. They are combing states for transgender people they can groom to lobby lawmakers and speak to media representatives, much as they identified gay men and lesbians with compelling personal stories to become faces of the movement and plaintiffs in lawsuits. And they are recruiting parents of transgender children to speak out on their kids\u2019 behalf. The \u201cmovement-wide focus\u201d now centers on \u201chow to crack the code on figuring out how to introduce transgender people to America,\u201d said Kasey Suffredini, chief program officer for Freedom for All Americans, a group founded last year to prod cities, states and Congress to expand minority civil rights protections to gay and transgender people. In a way, the task of introducing the public to transgender people has never been so easy. High-profile figures such as Caitlyn Jenner and actress Laverne Cox have put an attractive public face on the community. The Emmy-winning television series \u201cTransparent\u201d has delved deeply and frankly into one family\u2019s dynamics after the father transitions to a woman. Transgender youths are increasingly making their presence known in schools. The movement has logged some significant wins \u2014 including last week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, which sided with a transgender teenager who sued his school district for forbidding him to use the boys\u2019 restroom. But challenges remain. The transgender population is tiny, about 700,000 adults, according to the most recent serious effort to count the population, a 2011 study by the Williams Institute (the study\u2019s author, Gary J. Gates, said in an interview that he thinks the number is an undercount). There exist only two major national advocacy groups dedicated exclusively to transgender issues, advocates say, and their combined budget is about $5 million. Just this week, the small town of Oxford, Ala., passed a harsh new ordinance that could result in jail time for people caught in a public restroom different from their gender at birth. It\u2019s not just Southern states that have balked at extending civil rights laws to transgender people. New Hampshire, New York and Wisconsin all bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation but not gender identity, according to Freedom for All Americans. And even Massachusetts, the first state in the country to legalize same-sex marriage, lacks protections for transgender people in public accommodations. The gap is at least in part the result of bathroom concerns. Lawmakers are trying to remedy that with legislation this year. A recent report from the Center for American Progress and the Human Rights Campaign found that transgender workers experience twice the rate of unemployment as that of the population as a whole and are four times as likely to have an income of $10,000 or less. Also, 1 in 5 transgender people has experienced homelessness at some point, according to the Center for Transgender Equality. With the marriage question settled, opponents of same-sex marriage are instead \u201cgoing after an extra-vulnerable component of our community, the transgender community,\u201d said Marc Solomon, formerly the national campaign director for Freedom to Marry. The advocacy group, devoted to advancing same-sex marriage, closed shop after the Supreme Court decision. Several major efforts are underway to counter that push. The Gill Foundation, a leading philanthropy supporting pro- LGBT causes, recently funded a $400,000 study looking at ways to change voters\u2019 minds about transgender people through door-to-door canvassing. Freedom for All Americans recently began its Transgender Freedom Project, a $1 million public education initiative focused on building support for transgender people and nondiscrimination laws that protect them. Groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, the organization that initially reached out to Balentine, have begun holding training sessions and collecting stories of transgender people to use as part of media campaigns and to rally at statehouses. And two foundations that support LGBT causes, the Arcus Foundation and the NoVo Foundation, have begun a multiyear $20 million project to increase visibility as well as the quality of life for transgender people globally. A key goal of many of these projects will be to get more policy\u00admakers to meet transgender people in person. The power of such meetings, they say, was evident in South Dakota, where Gov. Dennis Daugaard (R) vetoed the bathroom bill after meeting with a group of transgender youths on Feb. 23. In explaining his veto, Daugaard said school districts were best equipped to address bathroom and locker room accommodations, not the state government. But activists are convinced that the meeting played a part. Balentine was not part of the group that formally met Daugaard. But as she snapped pictures at the state Capitol in Pierre that afternoon in her \u201cNo Hate In Our State\u201d T-shirt, she thought to see if Daugaard might see her for a few minutes. To her surprise, his secretary invited her right in. One week later, Daugaard vetoed the bill. Daugaard mostly listened as Balentine told parts of her life story, she recalls. In an interview, she said she knew at a very young age that she was a girl but was told by her disciplinarian, Viet\u00adnam-veteran dad that such feelings were unwelcome and unnatural. She compensated for her feminine feelings by becoming an \u201cuber male,\u201d she said, dating lots of women and immersing herself in athletics. She chose as her role model a figure who at the time seemed the very epitome of masculinity \u2014 Olympian Bruce Jenner, now better known as Caitlyn. She joined the military and then law enforcement, where she routinely volunteered for the most risky assignments, she said. \u201cI built this wall of lies around me,\u201d she said, \u201cand it made me want to die.\u201d At one point, she enrolled in cosmetology school. But she endured ridicule as a male makeup artist, she said, and eventually abandoned the trade to return to the military. A few years ago, Balentine retired. She and her wife, Pam, moved to an isolated, seven-acre property surrounded by lush national forest near Mount Rushmore and far from their closest neighbors. When she resolved to transition, to her disbelief and gratitude, her father came around, embracing her for the first time in her life. Pam stayed and even chose Balentine\u2019s new middle name, Nichole. But the challenges continued to pile up for Balentine, as they do for so many transgender people. All but one of her kids stopped talking to her the day she underwent gender-reassignment surgery. She struggled to find a community of transgender people for support. Last week, on the first anniversary of her surgery, Balentine\u2019s wife left her. But on Tuesday, Balentine said, Pam flew back, pledging to remain for the long haul. \u201cShe thinks it\u2019s going to be so easy for me to meet someone or have friends,\u201d Balentine said a few hours after Pam had boarded her plane. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t understand. Transgender people don\u2019t have it easy. Who would choose this? Who would want to lose their family and now their wife?\u201d A bright spot has been her newfound activism, Balentine said. The Human Rights Campaign has asked her to travel to North Carolina or Mississippi to help rally against recently passed legislation there. She\u2019s helping to start a nonprofit organization, called TransAction South Dakota, which is focused on building up transgender advocacy within the state. \u201cI\u2019ve just found a whole new career I absolutely love,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first one I\u2019ve liked since cosmetology.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "63bc4a3a-019a-11e6-9203-7b8670959b88", "score": 11.421299934387207}, {"content": "Title: After a wild week, conservative media stand (nervously) by Trump Content: Pro-Trump media outlets and commentators don\u2019t seem to be falling out of love with the president. But after one of the more tumultuous weeks in Washington, the leading lights of the Trump-boosting right aren\u2019t entirely misty-eyed about the state of their romance, either. President Trump got cover Friday morning from the likes of the Drudge Report, Breitbart News and Fox News on the Senate\u2019s failure hours earlier to repeal the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. All three suggested the blame for the bill\u2019s demise belonged to a handful of Republican holdouts, rather than Trump\u2019s management and leadership on the issue. But the president was on shakier ground earlier in the week as he publicly harassed Attorney General Jeff Sessions over Sessions\u2019s recusal from the Department of Justice\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. On another issue there seemed to be broad agreement: Newly named White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci is a loose cannon who threatens, possibly quite literally, the people who work in the White House. The Drudge Report put the focus squarely on Sen. John McCain of Arizona and a handful of recalcitrant Republicans for the defeat early Friday of a Senate bill that would have partially repealed former president Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. Its lead link on Friday morning was to a Washington Post story, which had the headline, \u201cThe night John McCain killed the GOP\u2019s health-care fight.\u201d Breitbart, the pro-Trump bible of the \u201calt-right,\u201d also tacitly echoed the not-Trump\u2019s-fault line. Its top story on Friday noted Trump\u2019s \u201cdisappointment\u201d over Republicans\u2019 failure \u201cto keep their promise to the American people,\u201d without mentioning the Trump had made the same pledge during the campaign. Other headlines smoldered with anger at McCain and Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), who voted against the final repeal bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who led the Senate\u2019s unsuccessful repeal effort, came in for his share of abuse, too. Trump\u2019s feud with Sessions earlier in the week was a bit more complicated. Sessions is a beloved figure among the president\u2019s supporters, so Trump\u2019s tweet-shaming of Sessions caused some cognitive dissonance within the conservative-media ecosystem. Conservative commentators Anne Coulter and Rush Limbaugh stuck up for Sessions; on his radio program on Monday, Limbaugh said it was it was \u201ca little bit discomforting, unseemly for Trump to go after such a loyal supporter this way.\u201d Fox prime-time host Tucker Carlson \u2014 who has called Trump\u2019s attacks on Sessions a \u201cuseless, self-destructive act\u201d \u2014 even traveled to El Salvador with the attorney general on Thursday for a sympathetic interview. Breitbart, meanwhile, was restrained in criticizing Trump over Sessions, but it did note in one story that his attacks were \u201clikely to fuel concerns from his base who see Sessions at the best hope to fulfill Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\u201d The site was positively rapturous about Trump\u2019s surprise decision on Wednesday to ban transgender people from military service. Columnist James Delingpole wrote that it was \u201ca step towards saving Western Civilization.\u201d Breitbart was blunt in its disdain for Scaramucci\u2019s profanity-laced diatribe to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza. The lead paragraph of its story Thursday night sarcastically noted that Scaramucci has tried to steal the spotlight from Trump before. \u201cMove over President Donald Trump,\u201d it read. \u201cYou are yesterday\u2019s news.\u201d It noted that the rant raised questions about whether the new White House communications chief \u201cdid not know how to smoothly go on and off the record . . . so that such inflammatory comments do not reflect badly on his boss.\u201d Breitbart seemed especially irked by Scarmucci\u2019s vulgar comments about Stephen K. Bannon, the White House\u2019s chief strategist and former chairman of Breitbart News, a fact not mentioned in its story. Fox News even went so far as to suggest that Scaramucci might be speaking literally when he told the New Yorker that he wanted to \u201ckill\u201d leakers inside the West Wing. \u201cWhat are you guys saying to the other staffers who may now have a lot of fear based on these comments,\u201d host Martha MacCallum asked press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. She replied, \u201cIn terms of people\u2019s safety, I certainly hate that somebody feels that way, but I\u2019ve worked with an incredible team over the last six months.\u201d By week\u2019s end, with the news agenda finally slowing down, conservative outlets seemed to be turning back to their usual targets. The top story on FoxNews.com, for example, was about a request by a group of Republicans in Congress to the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration during the 2016 presidential campaign.", "qid": 870, "docid": "978ab2a8-73a3-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304", "score": 11.379799842834473}, {"content": "Title: D.C. police probe recent attacks on gay, transgendered but say only one hate-related Content: A string of recent attacks involving gay and transgender victims in Washington has caused jitters among advocates, who fear that hate crimes are on the rise, but it has also revealed the challenge of identifying such incidents \u2014 and uncovered tension over whether victims\u2019 sexuality should be identified at all. The attacks include a homicide, a sexual assault, a shooting and a stabbing, and District police say they are investigating only one as a possible hate crime. At the urging of advocates, however, D.C. police have identified three of six recent victims as transgender. Some advocates agree that several of the incidents, two of which occurred Saturday, were most likely not motivated by sexual orientation. But they say all should be highlighted because a vulnerable group is involved and the public should know what\u2019s happening. Others disagree. Diane Davis of Temple Hills, the aunt of recent homicide victim Malika Stover, was angry when advocates distributed a funeral notice that read: \u201cShooting claims life of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] victim.\u201d Stover, 35, who was a lesbian, was not killed because she was gay, Davis said. \u201cShe was a person, not a label,\u201d said Davis, who thinks her niece was slain in a June 22 robbery of a dice game near her childhood home in Southeast Washington\u2019s Barry Farm. \u201cThat funeral statement contradicts what I think happened.\u201d Hassan Naveed, co-chairman of the group Gays and Lesbians Opposing Violence, said generating publicity about such crimes is important. \u201cPeople see transgendered as a target,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will attack certain people because they perceive them as being weak. We want people to realize that it is happening.\u201d D.C. police, accused in the past of being insensitive or indifferent to the gay and transgender community, now pay close attention. A gay and lesbian liaison unit investigates all cases with even a hint of suspected bias. The task force is examining all six recent attacks. And there are legal ramifications to the attention: A hate crime conviction in the District can lead to punishments up to 11 / 2 times the maximum penalty. Assistant D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham said five of the six attacks since June 21 are not considered hate crimes. Four of the cases involved transgender victims, and police in three of them listed their sexual orientation in news releases. \u201cAdvocates in that community seem to think offenses are not taken as seriously as others, and they ask that we\u201d list the sexual orientation, Newsham said. \u201cThey say they want that information out there, and we accommodate them.\u201d Police did not list the homicide victim, Stover, as gay. Ruby Corado, who runs a volunteer center for transgender women, said all crimes against that community should be considered hate crimes. She spoke of a transgender woman who was stabbed at least 11 times June 21 in an abandoned building in Southeast. Police said the incident occurred during an argument over money for sex. But advocates who have spoken to the victim said the attacker stabbed the woman after friends laughed at him for being with a transgender person. Police have made an arrest in that case. \u201cThe woman told me, \u2018I know what hate is, I looked at evil in his eyes,\u2019 \u201d Corado said. \u201cIf you want to kill somebody, you shoot them once. You don\u2019t stab them so many times.\u201d She said transgender women are \u201cnot leaving their houses because they are afraid of being the next victim. That\u2019s what hate does.\u201d District police say the number of hate and bias crimes has dropped 18 percent this year compared with last year, with the latest numbers available through the end of May. Newsham said the only recent attack being investigated as a possible hate crime occurred June 27 at Eastern Avenue NE. Police said a transgender woman was shot about 6 a.m. during a robbery of a purse. The police report said one of the gunmen pulled or knocked off the woman\u2019s wig, then shot her once in the buttocks as she ran away. In that case, Newsham described hate as a \u201cborderline motive\u201d and said detectives are continuing to investigate. Other attacks, including the two latest ones Saturday, are not considered hate crimes, Newsham said. A transgender woman was shot and injured during a robbery about 4 a.m. near Fifth and K streets Northeast, and another transgender woman was sexually assaulted after she accepted a ride from a man in the 300 block of 61st Street NE. \u201cThe District has a significant number of gay, lesbian and transgendered\u201d residents, Newsham said. \u201cIf you compare the number of crimes that have occurred involving that community to others it would be a very small percentage. . . . There\u2019s certainly no pattern here.\u201d Davis, the aunt of slaying victim Malika Stover, said Stover came out as gay in her late teens and was well known in the city\u2019s lesbian community. Davis said that Stover\u2019s mother died when she was a teenager and that she never knew her father. Stover dropped out of school before the ninth grade but later got her high school diploma and was working as a driver for MetroAccess, which provides public transportation for the disabled. A Metro spokeswoman confirmed she was an employee. Davis said her niece had a longtime partner with two grown children. She lived on Alabama Avenue in Southeast Washington, in a house once owned by her grandmother. Before working for Metro, she drove rental cars to different offices up and down the East Coast. Stover wasn\u2019t shy about her sexual identity, Davis said. On the night she was killed, she was in her old neighborhood, on Stevens Road, playing dice and gambling. \u201cShe grew up in the neighborhood where that went on all the time,\u201d Davis said, saying she does not think the motive in her niece\u2019s killing to be anything other than robbery. \u201cShe was good at it.\u201d Stover will be buried Wednesday after a service at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suitland.

That this administration seems to accept no responsibility in the law\u2019s fair application harks back to a dark time in our nation\u2019s history when the rights of individuals were determined by where they live. A joint letter sent Wednesday from officials at the Justice and Education departments told the nation\u2019s schools to disregard guidance issued last year by the Obama administration regarding their obligations to transgender students under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bars discrimination by sex for schools receiving federal funds. The Obama administration said the law applies to gender identity, and \u201cthis means that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.\u201d Requiring transgender students to use facilities that correspond with the sex listed on their birth certificates, Obama officials determined, would be a violation. The nonbinding guidance has been in abeyance since a judge issued an injunction in a lawsuit brought by 13 states. Shortly after Jeff Sessions was sworn in as attorney general, the Justice Department decided to drop its challenge to that injunction. On Wednesday, it notified the Supreme Court of its change in posture in a case brought by a transgender student in Virginia, Gavin Grimm, who has been barred from using the boys\u2019 bathroom at his school. The Gloucester County student had used the boys\u2019 facilities without problem or incident until the school board let itself be swayed by the irresponsible fear-mongering that too often is directed at transgender people. Indeed, there was a time when President Trump himself seemed able to see through this hysteria, expressing support for the rights of transgender people to \u201cuse the bathroom that they feel is appropriate\u201d and saying Caitlyn Jenner was welcome to use whatever bathroom at Trump Tower she wanted. That he apparently overrode the objections of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in endorsing the rollback of protections will inflict needless suffering on transgender students, a vulnerable population already subjected to harassment and bullying. \u201cNo young person should wake up in the morning fearful of the school day ahead\u201d was the poignant plea from more than 1,000 parents of transgender students. \u201cWhen this guidance was issued last year, it provided our families \u2014 and other families like our own across the country \u2014 with the knowledge and security that our government was determined to protect our children from bullying and discrimination.\u201d In abdicating its federal responsibility, the Trump administration sends the reprehensible message that these students are now on their own. **Read more here:** Gavin Grimm: I\u2019m transgender and can\u2019t use the student bathroom.

The legislation from Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) goes further than the North Carolina measure in one regard: It requires school principals to notify a parent if a student asks to be treated as a member of the opposite sex \u2014 whether by being allowed to use a different bathroom or being addressed by a different name or pronoun. Marshall said his Physical Privacy Act addresses a pressing social concern about student safety \u2014 one that, he noted, drew hundreds of parents to school board meetings on the subject in Prince William and Fairfax counties. He expressed fear that men and boys will pretend to be transgender to infiltrate bathrooms and locker rooms used by women and girls. \u201cSome guys will use anything to make a move on some teenage girls or women,\u201d he said. \u201cMere separation of the sexes should not be considered discrimination.\u201d The bill does not prohibit a government entity from providing \u201can accommodation, including the use of a single-occupancy restroom.\u201d The proposal drew immediate condemnation from legislators and organizations supportive of gay, lesbian and transgender rights, with Equality Virginia calling it \u201chateful and discriminatory.\u201d Few predicted it would pass into law. Even Marshall said leaders of his own party are unlikely to embrace the bill given its potential to turn off moderate Republican and independent voters ahead of this year\u2019s elections for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. \u201cMy intuition, based on experience, is the speaker\u2019s going to want to duck this,\u201d Marshall said, referring to House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford). A spokesman for Howell, Christopher E. West, was highly dismissive. \u201cThat\u2019s just Bob being Bob,\u201d West said. \u201cHe knows the House doesn\u2019t operate that way.\u201d Even if the bill passed the GOP-controlled General Assembly, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) would veto it. \u201cGovernor McAuliffe has been clear that he will veto any bill that restricts the rights of Virginians based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy said in a written statement. \u201cAs we saw in North Carolina, these bills don\u2019t just hamper civil rights \u2014 they kill jobs. The Governor is hopeful that Republicans in the General Assembly will drop these counterproductive bills and turn their focus toward building a stronger and more equal Virginia economy.\u201d Marshall\u2019s proposal drew praise from the conservative Virginia First Foundation. The group issued a written statement from board member Travis Witt, the pastor of Gilboa Christian Church in rural Mineral and the former chairman of the Virginia Tea Party Patriots Federation. \u201cPublic school facilities are not the place for social experiments that permit early exposure to sexual issues when there is ample evidence that such exposure can lead to long term developmental damage,\u201d his statement said. It noted that the bill \u201cmakes adequate provisions for children seeking single-use restrooms when needed and ensures that children are not forced to experience forced physical exposure to the opposite sex against their will.\u201d One of the most outspoken conservatives in the General Assembly, Marshall often rankles GOP leadership with bills to regulate social issues \u2014 which just as often die in committee. Among Marshall\u2019s other bills this year is one that would declare pornography a public health hazard. The bill comes as the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case filed by transgender student Gavin Grimm, now a senior at Gloucester High in Gloucester, Va., who sued the school board in 2015 after it passed a policy barring him from using the boy\u2019s bathroom. In April, a federal appeals court ruled in Grimm\u2019s favor, citing the Obama administration\u2019s position that such bathroom restrictions are a violation of Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in public schools. But the incoming Trump administration may stake out a different position, in which case the Supreme Court could remand the case to a lower court. Legislatures around the country have clashed over transgender issues in recent years. North Carolina\u2019s so called \u201cbathroom bill\u201d immediately ignited a firestorm, causing businesses like PayPal and Deutsche Bank to abandon expansions and prompting the NCAA and NBA to relocate sporting events. The bill also spurred a series of lawsuits, including dueling suits filed by the state and the Justice Department. It appeared the law may have been on its way out late last month, when North Carolina lawmakers met for a special session specifically so they could rescind the measure. However, after an acrimonious day that saw Republicans feud over whether to fully or partially repeal the bill, they left it in place, prompting scathing criticism from Gov. Roy Cooper (D) as well as from gay and transgender rights groups. Political analysts were dubious that Virginia will replay North Carolina\u2019s script on the bathroom bill. \u201cI would bet my bottom dollar that we will never see such a bill emerge from the legislature,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. \u201cThe Senate would kill it, even if the House passes it. I doubt it even gets out of the House.\u201d Sabato said that the bill would face an almost automatic veto from McAuliffe. Democrats, he said, would be eager to use such a veto to highlight to Virginians what one-party Republican rule could mean for the state. University leaders appeared to be leery of wading into the debate. Most are probably anxious to avoid generating friction with lawmakers as Richmond weighs other issues that affect their schools, including public financing of higher education. Peter Blake, director of the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, declined through a spokesman to comment, saying he had not yet reviewed Marshall\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe tend to follow pretty faithfully a rule of not commenting on proposed legislation, particularly at the start of the General Assembly, when there are so many bills out there and it\u2019s impossible to say what might move forward,\u201d said Justin Pope, chief of staff at Longwood University, a public institution in Farmville. Representatives of the state flagship University of Virginia, the College of William and Mary and other prominent public universities did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. James Parrish, executive director of Equality Virginia, said the bill \u201cwould cause immediate harm to our transgender community and economy.\u201d State Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria), a vocal proponent of gay and transgender rights, said Marshall\u2019s bill would be highly problematic. \u201cI personally know one transgender man who, though born a woman, now has a full beard, shaved head, deep voice and a bulky build,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would create much more controversy to require him to go into the ladies\u2019 room without Bob Marshall telling him where he has to go to the bathroom.\u201d Robert Rigby, a Latin teacher at West Potomac High School in Fairfax County and an advocate for LGBTQ students, said he is \u201chorrified\u201d by the proposed requirement that school principals notify parents when transgender students ask to use different bathrooms or be referred to by different names or pronouns. \u201cParents and children need to deal with this at their own pace without the schools taking charge,\u201d Rigby said. Some transgender students tell their teachers and classmates before broaching the subject with their parents, and school becomes a safe haven. But if teachers are required under certain circumstances to inform principals of a student\u2019s transgender status, \u201cthis will set up an atmosphere of distrust in the only place they have left to feel safe,\u201d Rigby said. Under Marshall\u2019s bill, any government entity that owns or rents a building would have to ensure that restrooms and changing facilities \u201cprovide physical privacy from members of the opposite sex.\u201d The bill states that \u201csex\u201d \u201cmeans the physical condition of being male or female as shown on an individual\u2019s original birth certificate.\u201d Staff writers Mark Berman and Nick Anderson contributed to this report. _An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the bill would require school principals to notify all parents if a student at their children\u2019s school asks ot be treated as a member of the opposite sex. The bill requires only that student\u2019s parents to be notified.

As outlined in Labor\u2019s fiscal 2018 plan, the move would fold the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, now home to 600 employees, into another government agency in the name of cost-cutting. The proposal to dismantle the compliance office comes at a time when the Trump administration is reducing the role of the federal government in fighting discrimination and protecting minorities by cutting budgets, dissolving programs and appointing officials unsympathetic to previous practices. The new leadership at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, has proposed eliminating its environmental justice program, which addresses pollution that poses health threats specifically concentrated in minority communities. The program, in part, offers money and technical help to residents who are confronted with local hazards such as leaking oil tanks or emissions from chemical plants. Under President Trump\u2019s proposed budget, the Education Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights \u2014 which has investigated thousands of complaints of discrimination in school districts across the country and set new standards for how colleges should respond to allegations of sexual assault and harassment \u2014 would also see significant staffing cuts. Administration officials acknowledge in budget documents that the civil rights office will have to scale back the number of investigations it conducts and limit travel to school districts to carry out its work. And the administration has reversed several steps taken under President Barack Obama to address LGBT concerns. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, has revoked the guidance to implement a rule ensuring that transgender people can stay at sex-segregated shelters of their choice, and the Department of Health and Human Services has removed a question about sexual orientation from two surveys of elderly Americans about services offered or funded by the government. The efforts to reduce the federal profile on civil rights reflects the consensus view within the Trump administration that Obama officials exceeded their authority in policing discrimination on the state and local level, sometimes pressuring targets of government scrutiny to adopt policies that were not warranted. Administration officials made clear in the initial weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency that they would break with the civil rights policies of his predecessor. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a review of agreements to reform police departments, signaling his skepticism of efforts to curb civil rights abuses by law enforcement officers. His Justice Department, meantime, stopped challenging a controversial Texas voter identification law and joined with the Education Department in withdrawing federal guidance allowing transgender students to use school bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. While these decisions have been roundly criticized by liberal activists, administration officials said that civil rights remain a priority for the Trump White House. \u201cThe Trump administration has an unwavering commitment to the civil rights of all Americans,\u201d White House spokeswoman Kelly Love said in an emailed statement. But Vanita Gupta, who was the head of Justice\u2019s civil rights division from October 2014 to January 2017, said that the administration\u2019s actions have already begun to adversely affect Americans across the country. \u201cThey can call it a course correction, but there\u2019s little question that it\u2019s a rollback of civil rights across the board,\u201d said Gupta, who is now president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Labor\u2019s budget proposal says that folding its compliance office into the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u201cwill reduce operational redundancies, promote efficiencies, improve services to citizens, and strengthen civil rights enforcement.\u201d Historically, the two entities have played very different roles. Unlike the EEOC, which investigates complaints it receives, the compliance office audits contractors in a more systematic fashion and verifies that they \u201ctake affirmative action\u201d to promote equal opportunity among their employees. Patricia A. Shiu, who led the compliance office from 2009 to 2016, said the audits are crucial because most workers don\u2019t know they have grounds to file a complaint. \u201cMost people do not know why they don\u2019t get hired. Most people do not know why they do not get paid the same as somebody else,\u201d she said. Under Obama, officials in the compliance office often conducted full-scale audits of companies, examining their practices in multiple locations, rather than carrying out shorter, more limited reviews as previous administrations had done. Some companies have questioned the more aggressive approach, noting the office has consistently found since 2004 that 98 percent of federal contractors comply with the law. But the compliance office also scored some major recent legal victories, including a $1.7 million settlement with Palantir Technologies over allegations that the data-mining company\u2019s hiring practices discriminated against Asians. In a case involving Gordon Food Service, which serves the Agriculture Department, the Pentagon and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the office found the company had \u201csystematically eliminated qualified women from the hiring process.\u201d The firm agreed to pay $1.85 million in wages to 926 women who had applied for jobs and hire 37 of them. Gordon Food was also forced to no longer require women to take a strength test. In Education Department budget documents, the administration acknowledges that proposed funding levels would hamper the work of that department\u2019s civil rights office. The budget would reduce staffing by more than 40 employees. \u201cTo address steady increases in the number of complaints received and decreased staffing levels, OCR must make difficult choices,\u201d the budget documents say. \u201cOCR\u2019s enforcement staff will be limited in conducting onsite investigations and monitoring, and OCR\u2019s ability to achieve greater coordination and communication regarding core activities will be greatly diminished.\u201d Some critics of the civil rights office said school districts often felt they were presumed guilty in the eyes of the federal government. \u201cThere was sort of this sense that . . . if there was a complaint filed, there must have been done something wrong,\u201d said Thomas J. Gentzel, executive director of the National School Boards Association. \u201cBut there\u2019s usually two sides to a story.\u201d Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill said that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Candice E. Jackson, who has been named as the acting head of the civil rights office, are committed to protecting all students from discrimination. \u201cEach civil rights complaint received by OCR is given due care and attention, with OCR serving as a fair and impartial investigative office,\u201d Hill said. Jackson\u2019s nomination has added to the anxiety of civil rights activists. Jackson, a lawyer from Vancouver, Wash. and author of a book about women who had accused President Bill Clinton of sexual assault, has written that programs aimed at fostering a diverse student body dismiss \u201cthe very real prices paid by individual people who end up injured by affirmative action.\u201d Similar concerns have been raised about Trump\u2019s likely selection of Eric S. Dreiband to head the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. A former Bush administration official and veteran conservative Washington lawyer, Dreiband has represented several companies that were sued for discrimination. (Dreiband is representing the Washington Post in an age and race discrimination case in federal court in the District.) _Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the status of a a rule ensuring that transgender people can stay at sex-segregated shelters of their choice.

In a dramatic special session Wednesday, North Carolina became the first state in the nation to require transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender they were born with rather than the one they identify with. Lawmakers passed it in response to a nondiscrimination ordinance adopted last month by Charlotte, North Carolina's largest city and the state's commercial hub. Incensed state Senate Democrats walked out of the vote in protest, but Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who originally opposed the special session, signed the bill into law late Wednesday, saying it was necessary to protect North Carolinian families concerned about their privacy and safety. So-called \"bathroom bills\" are a major flash point in the ongoing debate about LGBT rights since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last year. South Dakota's Republican governor vetoed one earlier this month, and other states are considering their own. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Simply repealing Charlotte's bathroom ordinance probably wouldn't have made such a large political ripple in a socially conservative-leaning state like North Carolina. One local poll showed 66 percent of likely North Carolinian primary voters either wanted the law repealed or a referendum on it. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But the political danger for Republicans comes from the fact that Republican legislators made the law much broader than even Democrats had anticipated. The law also prevents municipalities from creating new LGBT protections -- whether in bathrooms, in public accommodations or at the workplace. Some Democrats also think the law makes it difficult to sue for discrimination, though the interpretation of that clause is up for debate. (State Rep. Dan Bishop (R), the bill's sponsor, says the state's constitution required Republicans to override all LGBT non-discrimination laws just to override Charlotte's.) Still, its breadth has stirred up a backlash not unlike what Indiana Republicans faced last year when the state passed a religious freedom bill aimed at protecting businesses. Companies and organizations like American Airlines, Wells Fargo, Apple, Microsoft, Dow Chemical and the NCAA -- many of which have a significant presence in North Carolina -- have strongly opposed North Carolina's law. With the business community at their backs, Democrats can argue this new law won't just hurt LGBT residents, but that it will hurt North Carolina's economy -- just like evidence shows it hurt Indiana's. A survey found Indiana's largest city, Indianapolis, was estimated to have lost $60 million in economic investment in the aftermath of a religious freedom bill that passed the state last year. The business community was already in action in nearby Georgia, where Disney and Marvel are threatening to pull out of filming in Georgia if the state's Republican governor signs a religious liberty bill into law aimed at protecting clergy who don't want to perform same-sex weddings. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Sure enough, McCrory's Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Roy Cooper, released a video statement Wednesday that ties North Carolina's newest law to Indiana. \"We have seen how this played out when Indiana tried it \u2013 business left the state, or thought twice about bringing in new jobs, and millions of dollars in revenue was lost,\" he said. What's more, because the law preempts local ordinances, Democrats can reasonably argue Republicans are the ones playing the big-government role. Some of these arguments seem to have worked in Indiana. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), once a safe bet for reelection, is now considered vulnerable after his approval ratings plummeted in the religious freedom debate. Pence is actually one of two vulnerable GOP governors that made our list of the top five. The other? McCrory. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico McCrory was elected in 2012 as part of a Republican wave that swept the state's government. The former Charlotte mayor ran as a relative moderate in the general election, but Democrats hope to make the case in November that he's swung far to the right to accommodate the conservative state legislature. The fact that the governor just signed one of the most sweeping bathroom bills in the nation can only help fuel that narrative. \"He needs moderates to win,\" said state Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Democrat from the Charlotte area. Republicans say Democrats might be in a sticky position, too. Eleven Democrats in the House, more than a third of the caucus there, voted for the bill, so they're far from a united front. And given local polls showing concern over the Charlotte ordinance itself, it's fair to wonder if Democrats coming out so publicly against it might backfire on them. How would Cooper hold up in trying to explain North Carolina families why he supports letting transgender residents use public bathrooms and argue he's trying to dodge that? Things moved quickly Wednesday in North Carolina's special session; the law was introduced and passed in a matter of 12 hours. But it is very likely to remain an issue. Civil liberty and LGBT advocacy groups are looking at their legal options, claiming the bathroom section of it violates federal law. And like much of the fallout from this law, that, too, may benefit North Carolina Democrats.", "qid": 870, "docid": "243a7201bea19fa2a460294af5746886", "score": 11.23390007019043}, {"content": "Title: Trump renews Twitter attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions Content: President Trump launched another public assault Tuesday morning on his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, questioning why the Justice Department chief has not done more to investigate alleged \u201ccrimes\u201d by Hillary Clinton and those who have leaked information to the media. \u201cAttorney General Jeff Sessions has taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes (where are E-mails & DNC server) & Intel leakers!\u201d Trump tweeted at 6:12 a.m. from his personal account, his second Twitter message of the morning. The tweet was one in a series, and it continued the president\u2019s public attacks on Sessions, whose job appears to be in jeopardy. Sessions, a Republican former senator from Alabama, supported Trump from the early days of his candidacy and became one of the real estate magnate\u2019s most trusted advisers. But he fell out of favor with the president when he recused himself in March from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign, including probes of Russian interference in the electoral process, on grounds that he had been involved in the campaign. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump\u2019s tweets Tuesday morning. Asked whether Trump wants Sessions to leave, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not rule it out. \u201cLook, I know that he is frustrated and certainly disappointed in the attorney general for recusing himself, but . . . I think that\u2019s a decision that if the president wants to make, he certainly will,\u201d she said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Tuesday morning. \u201cThat frustration certainly hasn\u2019t gone away, and I don\u2019t think it will.\u201d Trump said in an interview with the New York Times last week that he would not have appointed Sessions to the position if he knew Sessions would recuse himself. In his first tweet Tuesday morning, Trump wrote about Hillary Clinton: \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - \u2018quietly working to boost Clinton.\u2019 So where is the investigation A.G.\u201d Trump seemed to be referring to reports that during the election campaign, the Democratic National Committee hired a Ukrainian American Democratic operative, Alexandra Chalupa, to mobilize ethnic communities, including Ukrainian Americans. In 2014, Chalupa had investigated the role that Paul Manafort, who went on to become Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, played in the rise of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. After leaving the campaign in July 2016, Chalupa continued her research. Politico reported that Chalupa said she sometimes shared her findings with officials at the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign, but campaign officials said they never received information. The White House has tried to compare this arrangement with the communication that the Trump campaign had with Russians during and after the campaign. At 6:21 a.m., Trump followed up with another tweet that took aim at the acting director of the FBI: \u201cProblem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!\u201d When McCabe\u2019s wife, Jill McCabe, was running as a Democrat for a state Senate seat in Virginia in 2015, she received campaign donations totaling about $660,000 from a political action committee affiliated with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a longtime Clinton family friend, and from the Virginia Democratic Party. There is no evidence that Clinton knew of the contributions. The FBI said in a statement in 2016 that Andrew McCabe \u201cplayed no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind\u201d for his wife\u2019s candidacy. About three months after Jill McCabe lost her race, her husband was put in charge of overseeing the bureau\u2019s investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server, and critics questioned his objectivity. Former FBI director James B. Comey has testified that Trump mentioned McCabe as he sought Comey\u2019s loyalty. Trump then took a break from tweeting about the Russia investigation to reflect on the major vote that is expected on health-care legislation in the Senate on Tuesday. At 6:52 a.m., the president returned to the topic of Russia to defend his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser in the White House and met privately with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday to answer questions about four meetings he had with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign and transition period. \u201cJared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up, 11 year old Barron Trump!\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to his youngest son. In criticizing Sessions on Tuesday, Trump reprised a line of attack he has used lately against the former Alabama senator, who emerged last year as his strongest congressional supporter. On Monday, Trump tweeted from his personal account: \u201cSo why aren\u2019t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?\u201d Sessions announced in March that he was recusing himself from campaign-related investigations a day after The Washington Post reported that he had twice met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign and did not disclose those meetings during his confirmation hearing in January before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Trump told the New York Times last week that he believes Sessions\u2019s recusal decision was \u201cvery unfair to the president.\u201d Trump\u2019s latest tweets fueled speculation that he is prodding Sessions to quit. Conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt tweeted Tuesday morning that Anthony Scaramucci, the president\u2019s new communications director, told him, \u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d regarding his reading that Trump\u2019s remarks mean he \u201cwants AG Sessions to resign.\u201d In an interview with Hewitt, Scaramucci described Trump as \u201cobviously frustrated\u201d but said he does not think the president wants to fire Sessions and ventured that they \u201cneed to work this thing out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear the president wants him gone,\u201d Hewitt shot back. Scaramucci replied: \u201cIf there\u2019s this level of tension in the relationship that\u2019s public, you\u2019re probably right. But I don\u2019t want to speak for the president on that.\u201d Later, Scaramucci jokingly asked Hewitt if he was available for the job. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee and a frequent Trump target himself, wrote on Twitter that it is \u201cfully transparent\u201d that Trump \u201cwants to force Sessions to resign so he can appoint someone to curb Mueller probe.\u201d Schiff added: \u201cOnly works if Senate lets it.\u201d He referred to special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, the former FBI director appointed in May to oversee investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and related matters. After coming under criticism from Trump last week, Sessions dismissed the notion that he would quit \u2014 with a caveat. \u201cWe love this job,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.\u201d Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "qid": 870, "docid": "003d15ca-7124-11e7-8839-ec48ec4cae25", "score": 11.227499961853027}, {"content": "Title: Turning away from street protests, Black Lives Matter tries a new tactic in the age of Trump Content: Outside the Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge, where police shot and killed Alton Sterling, a crowd gathered Tuesday night to hold a vigil and protest the Justice Department\u2019s decision not to charge the officer. They held signs and gave speeches. They prayed and cried. It was a vastly different scene from the one that had played repeatedly on cable news after Sterling\u2019s death last July, when activists blocked intersections, riot police arrived in armored vehicles and about 200 demonstrators were arrested. In recent years, policing has been among the nation\u2019s most visible issues as people outraged by use of force and racial disparities in punishment took to the streets under the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d banner. But activists say the movement\u2019s efforts have entered a new phase \u2014 one more focused on policy than protest \u2014 prompted by the election of President Trump. \u201cWhat people are seeing is that there are less demonstrations,\u201d said Alicia Garza, one of three women credited with coining the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag. \u201cA lot of that is that people are channeling their energy into organizing locally, recognizing that in Trump\u2019s America, our communities are under direct attack.\u201d The issue that galvanized the movement hasn\u2019t subsided. So far this year, police have shot and killed 23 unarmed people, a higher rate than in 2016, when 48 unarmed people were killed all year. Both years, about one in three of those people has been black. Activists say they\u2019re no less aware of those statistics than in years past. But like most of the political left, they were stunned by Trump\u2019s electoral victory in November. And in the months since, they\u2019ve grappled with the role of an antiracism movement at a time when political threats to other groups \u2014 immigrants, Muslims and women \u2014 have gained urgency and pushed more progressives into the streets in protest. In interviews, more than half a dozen leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement said that last year\u2019s presidential election prompted renewed focus on supporting other minority groups as well as amassing electoral power to fight an administration that has pledged to roll back Obama-era efforts to reshape policing practice. Those leaders \u2014 who hail from various factions of the decentralized movement of individuals and organizations that have, at times, clashed \u2014 said the reality of Trump\u2019s presidency has forced a reconsideration of strategy. \u201cThere was a lot of regrouping that had to happen within our movement and on the broader left to really think strategically,\u201d said Asha Rosa, the national organizing co-chair for the Black Youth Project 100. The first major convening of young black activists during the Trump presidency came in April, when they met in Memphis for speeches, marches and workshops marking the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cBeyond Vietnam\u201d speech. They were joined by representatives of organized labor, the Fight for $15 minimum-wage effort, and a smattering of immigrant-advocacy and Muslim-rights groups. The Black Lives Matter network is now one of more than 50 groups that have christened themselves The Majority, a coalition of progressives working on social justice issues, including LGBT rights and Islamaphobia. Even before the election, some of the most prominent activists in the Black Lives Matter movement were expanding their focus to broader political efforts. Garza helped develop the Women\u2019s March political platform and is an organizer for the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a labor organization. \u201cWe are also doing a lot of work to build bridges between other movements and communities caught in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a real opportunity for us to build a movement of movements.\u201d DeRay Mckesson, a Baltimore-based activist whose live tweeting from Ferguson, Mo., during the 2014 protests earned him hundreds of thousands of followers, ran for mayor of Baltimore last year and, after that unsuccessful bid, joined newly elected Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez\u2019s transition team. He has spent much of the year rolling out policy platforms and mobilizing tools, including the Resistance Manual and a project called OurStates, a site that helps people combat Republican policies in their state. Garza and Mckesson also have claimed the spoils of relative celebrity. Garza has been a fixture on the paid speakers\u2019 circuit while helping secure funding from major donors for the Black Lives Matter network. Mckesson has been mingling with cultural luminaries and political types, practicing his philosophy that the movement needs to work within the system. Black Lives Matter\u2019s transition from street protests to policy is not unusual, said Stephen Zunes, a University of San Francisco professor who studies social movements. It\u2019s through such work that a movement\u2019s priorities \u2014 like mandatory use of officer body cameras \u2014 can become national standards, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s actually the way effective social movements often work or behave,\u201d Zunes said, pointing to the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations in the wake of the financial crisis as a counterexample. \u201cWhat the Occupy people did not learn, or by and large do, is go do the lobbying, the organizing to make change happen. They wound up fetishizing the \u2018occupy\u2019 part, and then, by and large, it fizzled.\u201d Much of the push for policy change is being driven by local chapters of Black Lives Matter, under the national media\u2019s radar, Garza notes. In Memphis and Atlanta, activists have focused on challenging the \u201cmoney bail\u201d system, their term for the widespread practice of holding people in jail who are unable to pay even small amounts required by courts to assure they will show up for trial. Poor defendants \u2014 who stand to lose jobs, apartments and custody of their children as they sit in jail \u2014 often plead guilty to lesser crimes without seeing a judge or jury. Local Black Lives Matter activists raised more than $33,000 to bail black mothers out of jail just before Mother\u2019s Day, said Mary Hooks, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Atlanta. The organization also is pushing the city council to make possession of a small quantity of marijuana punishable by a $75 ticket rather than arrest, and it is demanding that Atlanta\u2019s mayor examine how the police force has been \u201cmilitarized,\u201d Hooks said. Activists note that these efforts rarely make local news, let alone receive the national attention given to Ferguson protests after the fatal police shooting of a black teenager, Michael Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s not because we\u2019re not organizing,\u201d said Shanelle Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Black Lives Matter Global Network. \u201cI think the media companies, vying for the very little brain space in people\u2019s minds, are reporting on what they think people want to hear about right now. And that\u2019s Trump.\u201d The Trump presidency is challenging the movement\u2019s goals in another way. In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered Justice Department officials to review oversight agreements that the Obama administration put in place for police departments that showed wide racial disparities in policing practices. Since 2009, the agency has investigated 25 law enforcement agencies and entered monitoring and reform agreements with 14 of them. Advocates suspect Sessions plans to walk away from the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to reduce the number of people killed by police and contend with the disproportionate toll such shootings take on black and Latino Americans. During Sessions\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing in January, he described federal investigations into police departments as damaging to officer morale and implied that the Justice Department\u2019s scrutiny of police work had contributed to officer deaths. \u201cThis must not continue,\u201d Sessions told the Senate. Still, the movement\u2019s impact has been visible in some communities. In recent controversial encounters between police and unarmed black people, law enforcement has responded faster and with more regret than seen in years past. In suburban Dallas on Tuesday, an officer was fired three days after he fatally shot a 15-year-old boy sitting in a car. The officer was later charged with murder. In North Charleston, S.C., former officer Michael Slager \u2014 who was charged with fatally shooting Walter Scott in the back after a traffic stop \u2014 pleaded guilty to using excessive force last week. And last month in Grand Rapids, Mich., police released body-camera footage a few weeks after officers held a group of unarmed black boys, ages 12 to 14, at gunpoint. Activists there say the fact that officers were even wearing body cameras was a result of community pressure. In 2015, community groups and city officials released a report on local policing that included a 12-item to-do list that included equipping every officer with a body camera. Elected officials and the city manager have promised to make a priority of the entire plan. \u201cActivism looks like a lot of different things: It can look like voting, it can look like protest, it can look like calling your representatives,\u201d said Aditi Juneja, a law student who works with Campaign Zero. \u201cThe question shouldn\u2019t be, \u2018Will this activism be sustained?\u2019 because for many people the work is very personal and it isn\u2019t going to stop. The question is how it will sustain and how it will continue to manifest.\u201d Ashley Cusick in Baton Rouge contributed to this report. ****", "qid": 870, "docid": "a2acf37a-28fe-11e7-b605-33413c691853", "score": 11.22089958190918}, {"content": "Title: Barred from the boys\u2019 bathroom, a transgender teen sues a Florida school board Content: When Drew Adams began at Allen D. Nease High School in Ponte Vedra, Fla., he was excited for a fresh start with new classmates. The transgender teen, who was born female, transitioned the summer before his freshman year. He was going to school as a boy for the first time. It also meant that he was using the boys\u2019 bathroom. But school officials barred him from the boys\u2019 bathroom a month after school began in 2015, Drew said, after someone anonymously complained about his presence there. When his mother, Erica Kasper, failed to reach a resolution with school officials, she filed a complaint with the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which had successfully pressed other school districts into allowing transgender students to use bathrooms that matched the gender they identify with. The office began investigating but stopped after a federal judge in August 2016 issued an injunction in response to a lawsuit challenging the department\u2019s protections for transgender students. After hearing nothing from federal officials for nearly a year, and after the Trump administration rescinded protections for transgender schoolchildren seeking to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity, Drew and his mother gave up hope. Last week they sued school officials and the St. Johns County School Board, alleging that the school system is violating Drew\u2019s rights by refusing him access to the boys\u2019 bathroom and directing him to use out-of-the-way unisex bathrooms. \u201cForcing me to use a separate restroom \u2026 makes it clear to me that the school district sees me as a lesser person,\u201d said Drew, now 16 and a rising junior, who said he has missed class trekking to the unisex bathrooms. The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, alleges that school officials are violating Title IX, the federal law that bars sex discrimination in public schools, and the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Drew and his mother are represented by Lambda Legal. St. Johns County Superintendent Tim Forson, speaking on behalf of the school district, said in an email: \u201cWe disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the law.\u201d School board chairman Tommy Allen declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying through his executive secretary that he could not answer questions about an ongoing legal issue. Drew\u2019s case comes as LGBT advocates are closely monitoring how the Education Department under President Trump handles civil rights complaints from gay and transgender students. Under President Barack Obama, the department successfully pressed several school districts to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that matched their gender identity, often raising the ire of local officials and others who believe the federal government overstepped its authority. The Obama administration issued guidance in April 2016 directing public schools to give transgender students access to bathrooms that match the gender they identify with. President Trump has proposed cutting the department\u2019s civil rights staff. In February, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Obama-era guidance. Under Trump, the Education Department has also issued a memo saying civil rights investigators could close complaints from transgender students who have been barred from bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The department closed two high-profile cases involving such complaints. An Education Department spokesman said the civil rights office continues to investigate a discrimination complaint made by a transgender person in the St. Johns County district, but the spokesman said he could not identify the individual or the school involved because of privacy laws. After three school counselors met with Drew in September 2015 to tell him he was no longer allowed in the boys\u2019 bathroom, his mother met with school officials, hoping to persuade them to change their minds, according to the lawsuit. But she encountered resistance from administrators. One told her he was concerned a transgender girl would \u201cwave her penis around\u201d in a girls\u2019 bathroom, according to the suit. Originally, Kasper and Drew hoped their civil rights complaint with the Education Department would lead to a resolution. A federal investigator began looking into the case and negotiating with school officials to give Drew access to the bathroom. Kasper and Drew were heartened when the Obama administration issued guidance that extended protections for transgender students. \u201cI had hoped that maybe the OCR would talk to the district and force their hand into making them treat me right,\u201d Drew said. Then, several states sued to overturn the guidance, calling it an overreach of federal authority, and in August a judge issued an injunction halting the guidance, which meant the department also had to halt investigations related to it. The same month, an investigator told Kasper and Drew that Drew\u2019s case was in a holding pattern because of the injunction. They said they have heard nothing from the department since. Now, they said they hope for resolution through a lawsuit. Drew, who is volunteering at a hospital this summer, said he dreams of becoming a psychiatrist specializing in treating transgender patients, \u201ccombining my two loves: my queerness and medicine.\u201d He took three Advanced Placement classes and four honors courses as a sophomore plans to keep up his rigorous academic load next fall.

Health-care legislation languishes without presidential leadership. The Senate fails to pass a measure crafted by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, fails to pass an outright repeal and even fails to pass a proposal to go back to the drawing board. Huge majorities in Congress, declining to bless President Trump\u2019s love affair with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, vote for new sanctions against Russian officials; legislation passes the Senate, 98 to 2, and the House, 419 to 3. The veto-proof rebuke to the president seizes a foreign-policy function from an unreliable commander in chief. As the deadline looms to avoid a default on U.S. debt, Susan Collins (R-Maine), a Senate committee chairman, is heard on a hot mic saying she\u2019s \u201cworried\u201d about the president\u2019s stability and calling his administration\u2019s handling of spending matters \u201cjust incredibly irresponsible.\u201d She says she doubts Trump even knows how the budget process works. Trump, baffling and alarming allies, goes on the attack against his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was an outspoken supporter of Trump\u2019s candidacy. Trump clearly wants Sessions to resign, but Sessions is ignoring him. Sessions\u2019s former colleagues in the Senate back him over his boss \u2014 and they hope Trump isn\u2019t crazy enough to start a crisis by firing Sessions and then special prosecutor Robert Mueller. Meanwhile, the president continues to sow chaos with perpetual distractions. He fires off a tweet Wednesday morning announcing he is banning transgender people from serving in the military. The tweet apparently catches even the Pentagon by surprise and draws rebukes from pro-military Republicans who argue that all able-bodied, patriotic Americans should be allowed to serve. And the ship of state sails on, rudderless. This is what it might look like if there were no president at all: stuff happens, but nothing gets done. Actually, the majority in Congress has great difficulty even doing nothing. McConnell and his team scheduled a vote on repealing Obamacare for 11:30 a.m. Wednesday \u2014 a proposal that was, by all accounts, destined for failure. But when the appointed hour came, Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), sponsor of the repeal measure, requested a quorum call \u2014 a Senate procedure to stall for time. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) rose. \u201cMr. President, I think there was some confusion \u2014\u201d he began. But Enzi objected, Wyden was forbidden to speak, and the quorum call resumed \u2014 for 43 silent minutes. Senators arrived for the scheduled pre-lunch vote. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) went to the clerk\u2019s table to give a thumbs up and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) went to give a thumbs down, and both were told the same thing: \u201cWe\u2019re not voting.\u201d Senators milled about the chamber and huddled in clusters while aides and Senate leaders came and went to resolve the impasse, an arcane dispute about points of order and procedures for amendments. Finally, Enzi spoke: The vote would be postponed for four more hours. The Sisyphean act, all for a proposal that was going nowhere, encapsulated the whole Dada enterprise of health-care legislation. McConnell, thwarted in his quest to round up votes for the House-passed version of Trumpcare, or for his own Trumpcare alternative, or even for a repeal of Obamacare without a replacement, decided instead to risk everything on a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d \u2014 a parliamentary maneuver that allows debate to begin. McConnell won that vote Tuesday by the thinnest possible margin, a 50-50 tie, broken by Vice President Pence. But then McConnell was the proverbial dog that caught the car. Hours later, he brought up his health-care legislation, and it went down, 43 to 57, losing nine of his fellow Republicans and falling 17 votes short of what he needed. On Wednesday came Enzi\u2019s repeal proposal, which wouldn\u2019t have taken effect for two years to buy lawmakers more time to draft an Obamacare replacement. After the four-hour delay, it went down, 45 to 55, with seven Republicans defecting. Senators then voted down, on party lines, a Democratic proposal to send the whole thing back to committee. Republicans, after complaining for years that they had been jammed by Democrats on the passage of Obamacare, brought their alternative forward in a secretive, rushed, Republican-only process without hearings. Far from giving lawmakers time to \u201cread the bill,\u201d GOP Senate leaders had them vote to begin debate without knowing which legislation they would be debating. Soon comes a vote on \u201cskinny repeal,\u201d which, if it became law, would sabotage Obamacare by eliminating individual and employer requirements to provide health insurance. But it won\u2019t become law; it would merely become an excuse for more negotiations that would pit Senate GOP moderates against House GOP conservatives.

The Kansas board argued that local schools are best suited to decide how to handle issues that transgender students confront in school, including which bathrooms they are allowed to use and which name and gender appears on class rosters and other school records. Its vote to push back against the Obama administration\u2019s decree \u2014 which requires schools to allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity \u2014 was unanimous Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe are firm in our belief that decisions about the care, safety and well-being of all students are best made by the local school district based on the needs and desires of the students, parents and communities they serve,\u201d said the statement adopted Tuesday. \u201cIn Kansas, like many other states, our schools have been addressing transgender student needs with sensitivity and success for many years.\u201d The Obama administration\u2019s guidance is not legally binding, but schools and districts that don\u2019t comply can be investigated and can lose federal education funding if they refuse to come into compliance. Its not clear whether the state board\u2019s vote is enough to put Kansas at risk of losing its federal education funding, which amounts to about 9 percent of the state\u2019s K-12 education budget, according to a spokeswoman for the state education department. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning. Obama administration officials and LGBT activists have said that the directive is necessary to ensure that schools are protecting the civil rights of some of their most vulnerable students. Transgender people report high rates of bullying and harassment, as well as depression and attempted suicide. But the directive has sparked a backlash from politicians and activists who say that the administration\u2019s stance \u2014 and particularly its stance on bathroom and locker room access for transgender children \u2014 amounts to a federal overreach that endangers students\u2019 privacy. Not everyone agrees that Kansas schools are effectively serving transgender children. Stephanie Mott, executive director of the Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project, said she regularly receives phone calls, emails and text messages from students who don\u2019t feel comfortable in school because their teachers insist on calling them by the wrong name or won\u2019t allow them to use the restroom that matches their identity. Mott called the board\u2019s vote \u201cextraordinarily sad.\u201d \u201cThe state board of education has no idea what it\u2019s like to be a transgender person in this state, especially a transgender youth in a school that\u2019s not accommodating,\u201d she said. Mott and other activists say that Republican state lawmakers are turning transgender children into a bargaining chip in a long-running fight over school funding, threatening to introduce legislation that would force children to use bathrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificates unless Democrats fall into line with the Republican majority. \u201cThe school board is sitting up there going, \u2018Everything is wonderful in Kansas schools,\u2019 and at the same time we have a legislator who\u2019s going, \u2018I\u2019m going to make it more difficult for all transgender students in the state of Kansas,'\u201d Mott said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge disconnect there.\u201d In an interview Wednesday, Whitmer said that he wants the special session to move quickly and stay focused on funding, and would only introduce the bathroom bill if Democrats try to pass new gun controls or other such unrelated measures. \u201cOnce you put your pet issues on the back burner, I\u2019ll do the same with mine,\u201d he said. Whitmer said he does expect the legislature to consider the bathroom bill during its next regular session.

And it could be another 20 years before one is open again. On the same day that Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions was sworn in as U.S. attorney general, Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley (R) appointed one of the state's most-watched Republican politicians to fill Sessions's now-vacant U.S. Senate seat: Luther Strange. Strange, the sitting Alabama attorney general, has been groomed for this job for decades, insiders say, and if he can win election in 2018, he could hold it for decades to come. But, it's Alabama, so there's always political intrigue afoot. In appointing Strange, 63, to the Senate on Thursday, Bentley has in some ways appointed his political foe. And that has put the embattled governor on the defensive back home. Here's what you need to know about the next senator from Alabama and how it could change the state's politics: After a failed race for lieutenant governor, Strange knocked off the incumbent attorney general in 2010. Shortly after getting elected, Strange helped negotiate a settlement from the 2010 BP oil spill. Strange recused himself from that case because he had taken money from Hubbard's political action committee, but he was not necessarily impartial. \u201cThis is a good day for the rule of law in our state,\u201d Strange said in a statement after Hubbard's conviction. In November, the GOP-dominated state legislature put impeachment proceedings against Bentley on hold because lawmakers said the attorney general's office was conducting a related investigation. Strange has never confirmed the existence of an investigation, though Alabama insiders note that if there is one, his departure does not preclude the attorney general's office from continuing it. Anti-Obamacare? Check. Anti-regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency? Check. Anti-federal-government regulations, period? Check. Pro-coal industry and pro-gun rights? Check and check. As attorney general, Strange seized nearly every opportunity to join lawsuits against the Obama administration \u2014 from federal guidance over opening up bathrooms to transgender students, to stopping refugee resettlement. He also fought politically charged battles at home aimed at broadening gun rights and limiting gambling on Native American reservations. All of this has the convenient effect of helping Strange position himself for a run for higher office, insiders say. \u201cHe took a lot of stances that would make him popular with primary voters,\u201d said Alabama GOP consultant Brent Buchanan. Alabama Republicans describe Strange as someone the GOP political and business establishments can get behind \u2014 and in many cases already have. Strange fits the textbook definition of a traditional Alabama politician: \u201cHe's tall, he's got the good-looking family, he's from the right part of the state (the richest part of Birmingham),\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cHe has got in zero dust-ups publicly.\u201d In other words, he's a safe bet and known quantity for the Republican establishment of Alabama. Another reason insiders are generally happy with Strange's appointment? He's a mix of Sessions \u2014 who is an ace at delivering firebrand messages to the right \u2014 and Alabama's senior senator, Shelby (R), who prefers to work behind the scenes to get things done. Bentley is term-limited, which means there will be an open governor's race in 2018 no matter his legal standing. Everyone had expected Strange to be a top candidate, but now the field opens up. And the likeliest beneficiary of that is the head of the Alabama Senate, Sen. Del Marsh (R), who is widely seen as wanting to run for governor. Suspended state chief justice Roy Moore is another possibility. Strange will have just a year and some change to settle into the Senate and start preparing for his first campaign as senator. He'll face a primary in June 2018 and an election in November. There's a possibility that state Sen. Trip Pittman (R) from the Mobile area could run against Strange. And he could present a formidable challenge: If Strange is the establishment Republican, Pittman would be the Trump-esque Republican in the race. Also, Pittman has a bigger frame than even \u201cBig Luther,\u201d if you can imagine that.

Comstock, Taylor on transgender issue reflect political landscape Content: President Trump\u2019s decision to ban transgender individuals from serving in the military highlights recent votes on a related issue by two Republican members of Congress from Virginia whose districts are being targeted by Democrats in 2018. They took opposite stances on a measure that would have blocked an Obama-era practice requiring the Pentagon to pay for gender transition surgeries and hormone therapy. The \u201cHartzler amendment\u201d \u2014 named after Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), who proposed adding it to the annual defense policy bill \u2014 failed by a vote of 214 to 209. Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) of Northern Virginia was among the 24 Republicans who joined all Democrats in voting against the amendment. \u201cCongresswoman Comstock\u2019s vote on this issue reflected her view that [Defense] Secretary [Jim] Mattis, and the professionals at the Defense Department are best equipped to define these policies,\u201d her spokesman, Jeff Marschner, said in a statement. \u201cThe congresswoman trusts that Secretary Mattis will provide the clarity and details on what is in the best interest of military readiness going forward.\u201d Rep. Scott W. Taylor (R), a freshman from Virginia Beach, voted for the amendment, despite a record of supporting LGBT causes through legislation. Taylor said that Trump\u2019s ban, announced Wednesday via Twitter, is premature because the Defense Department is in the midst of a review of its policies addressing transgender members of the military. \u201cThere are heroic military members willing to put their lives on the line and give the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf, regardless of their gender identity,\u201d he said in a statement. He said he voted for the Hartzler amendment \u201con the basis of individual medical readiness,\u201d meaning that he did not want taxpayers to cover the year-long post-surgery recuperation period. Nationally, Democrats hoping to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on Trump\u2019s low approval ratings in Virginia\u2019s urban regions consider Comstock\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s districts possible pickup opportunities. Multiple Democrats are vying for the nominations to challenge them both. They say Comstock, whose district voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump by 10 points, is out of step with moderate voters in Loudoun County, in the heart of the district. She has at times criticized Trump and voted against the House Republican health-care bill. Trump won by three points in Taylor\u2019s district, which has for brief periods been represented by a Democrat. Trump said in tweets that the government \u201cwill not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\u201d He added: \u201cOur military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.\u201d Taylor, a former Navy SEAL and defense hawk who supports Trump, has backed LGBT rights. In the state General Assembly, he sponsored a bill that would have banned LGBT discrimination in housing. Within two months of joining Congress, he introduced similar federal legislation. Last month he won praise from the Human Rights Campaign as one of two House Republicans \u2014 among 238 \u2014 to support a federal ban on LGBT discrimination. Vivian Wise, a transgender woman and Navy officer who works in off-ship communications and lives in Virginia Beach, said the ban leaves her wondering whether she should search for a new job and place to live. She said she considers Taylor\u2019s vote for the Hartzler amendment an example of \u201cnaked bigotry and a backlash against progress the transgender community has made in recent decades.\u201d \u201cFrankly I wasn\u2019t surprised at all,\u201d she said. \u201cRepresentative Taylor is something of a water carrier for his party. He seems to be someone who will go along with the majority.\u201d James Parrish, executive director of Equality Virginia, said the fact that Republican support helped kill the Hartzler amendment proves advocacy efforts on behalf of the transgender community are working. \u201cThese are patriotic Americans who are putting their lives on the line to protect our country and preserve our freedoms and there should be no question about whether they should have the same benefits that all active duty members of the military and veterans have,\u201d he said. Democrats in Congress and across Virginia criticized the ban. Gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, a former Army combat medic and graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, tweeted: \u201cAnyone who wants to serve our country in the military should be welcomed. They\u2019re patriots and should be treated as such.\u201d Danica Roem (D), a transgender woman who is challenging incumbent Del. Robert G. Marshall (R) for a statehouse seat representing Prince William County, posted a series of tweets, including: \u201cTransgender military members like Logan Ireland & Laila Villanueva have done more to serve & protect America than Donald Trump ever will.\u201d A spokesman for Ed Gillespie, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, said Gillespie does not support barring transgender people from the military but would be open to changing his views if a Pentagon review of the current policy concludes otherwise. Gillespie also opposes taxpayer funding for gender transition surgeries for service members, the spokesman said.

The responses from nominee Betsy DeVos were submitted Monday to the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which voted Tuesday morning to send her confirmation to the full Senate for final approval. In answering a set of questions from Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) on how she would address bullying of LGBT students, DeVos wrote: \u201cEvery child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, thrive, and grow.\u201d That sentence is almost identical to language used by Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division under President Barack Obama, in a news release announcing the administration\u2019s controversial guidance to schools on how to accommodate transgender students. \u201cEvery child deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment that allows them to thrive and grow,\u201d Gupta said in the May 2016 release. Rob Goad, a White House education adviser, said in an email: \u201cThis is character assassination. The secretary designate has long been referencing the need for safe and supportive learning environments, free of discrimination, for all students, so that they can learn, achieve, thrive, grow and lead successful productive lives. To level an accusation against her about these words included in responses to nearly 1,400 questions \u2014 139 alone from the ranking member \u2014 is simply a desperate attempt to discredit Betsy DeVos, who will serve the Department of Education and our nation\u2019s children with distinction if confirmed.\u201d The revelation comes as Democrats are making an all-out push against key Trump nominees \u2014 including DeVos, attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), treasury secretary nominee Steve Mnuchin, and others. But Democrats cannot block those confirmations unless they can persuade a handful of Republicans to break with the new president. DeVos has come under withering scrutiny from Democrats who have raised concerns about her advocacy for school privatization initiatives, her financial ties to the education industry and the seemingly weak grasp of federal civil rights laws she demonstrated at her confirmation hearing this month. Murray made reference to the apparent copying in remarks at the committee vote. \u201cThis nominee is being jammed through with corners being cut and with the minority being brushed aside,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just received responses to hundreds of written questions yesterday, less than 24 hours before this scheduled vote, and with no time to fully review and ask any follow-up questions. Though, I will say, upon initial review, many of the responses look copied and pasted from previous statements or are simple reiterations of the law and no true responses at all.\u201d Murray also appears to have used language from other sources without attribution in at least two questions she asked of DeVos. One question about personnel shortages in special education included six sentences that match verbatim language from a factsheet published by the National Coalition on Personnel Shortages in Special Education and Related Services. Another question, about DeVos\u2019s stance on resolving student complaints about distance-education programs, included several phrases that match language in a 2016 Education Department press release. \u201cSenator Murray and Committee staff work closely with constituents and education advocates to make sure that the people she represents have a voice in this process and have their questions and concerns addressed by the nominees,\u201d said Eli Zupnick, a spokesman for Murray. \u201cAs questions and ideas from advocates and education groups were pulled in by staff for the written questions for the record, a number of lines were included in the final product that did not include proper citation to their original source.\u201d In a set of questions about her views on lesbian, gay and bisexual students, including about whether transgender students should be able to use bathrooms that match their gender identity, DeVos answered: \u201cEvery student deserves to attend school in a safe, supportive environment where they can learn, achieve and thrive and are not discriminated against. Period.\u201d That language is similar to language appearing in an article in a magazine published by ASCD, an organization devoted to education leadership. The article outlines what educators can do to create schools that are supportive of transgender students, and concludes: \u201cYou \u2014 as an educator and an ally \u2014 can dramatically shift the school climate to one that is safe, supportive, and inclusive: a place where all students can learn, achieve, and thrive.\u201d In other instances, answers that DeVos submitted in Murray in her 62-page response used text verbatim from federal statutes and Education Department materials without direct quotation. In one response, to a question about whether she would continue the practice of publishing a list of schools under Title IX civil rights investigations, DeVos said, \u201cOpening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has made a determination about the merits of the complaint.\u201d That language mirrors an Education Department website: \u201cOpening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that OCR has made a determination with regard to the merits of the complaint.\u201d Other responses refer to a requirement that the department\u2019s assistant secretary for civil rights \u201cmake an annual report to the Secretary, the President, and the Congress summarizing the compliance and enforcement activities\u201d of the department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights and that the assistant secretary is authorized \u201cto collect or coordinate the collection of data necessary to ensure compliance with civil rights laws within the jurisdiction\u201d of the civil rights office.

Just days earlier, it appeared that North Carolina could scrap the law after months of criticism. Instead, the status quo remained in place.

A spokeswoman for the city said the initial repeal vote Monday had affected only the part of the ordinance dealing with public accommodations, such as bathrooms, which council members thought would \u201csufficiently [fulfill] the requests of the General Assembly\u201d and lead to H.B. 2\u2019s repeal. In a statement issued Wednesday night after state legislators failed to repeal H.B. 2, the city said officials there are \u201cdisappointed with this unfortunate outcome.\u201d \u201cThe Charlotte City Council acted in good faith to do everything it understood was needed to necessitate the state legislature repealing HB2,\u201d the statement said. When the council repealed part of its ordinance Monday, it stated that the measure would be restored if H.B. 2 were left in place by Dec. 31. That deadline was not included in the city\u2019s repeal Wednesday, a Charlotte spokeswoman said. \u201cThe names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished,\u201d Forest, a supporter of H.B. 2, said in a statement Wednesday morning. Opponents of expanded transgender rights say that allowing explicit protections, particularly in the public sphere, not only breaks with long-standing social mores when it comes to gender and bathrooms but also could open the door to sexual predators gaining access to women\u2019s restrooms. Rights groups, however, say that such arguments are rooted in offensive stereotypes and do not reflect the reality of most transgender people, who have already been using their preferred bathrooms without incident.

The roots of the hostility Goldberg describes are in the second-wave feminism of the 1970s, and I was curious if Armistead Maupin\u2019s \u201cTales of the City\u201d series, about the marvelous transgender landlady Anna Madrigal and her tenants, reflected any of those hostilities. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Maupin\u2019s nine-book opus, which came to a conclusion this year with the publication of \u201cThe Days of Anna Madrigal,\u201d is a magnificent and moving experience for readers. Maupin\u2019s vision of characters as they work through tectonic changes in the American understanding of sexual orientation and gender identity is a tremendous exercise in empathy, and a significant cultural contribution to what seems to be a potentially seismic movement in the movement for transgender rights. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico To the extent that tensions between transgender women and feminism do appear in \u201cTales of the City,\u201d they are exceptionally mild. And the conflict is not over whether trans women carry male privilege into their new lives, but over whether transgender women are reinforcing gender stereotypes that paint women as girlish and helpless. This kind of thinking did show up in Nora Ephron\u2019s review of \u201cConundrum,\u201d Jan Morris\u2019 memoir of her gender transition. \u201cJan Morris is perfectly awful at being a woman,\u201d Ephron wrote. \u201cWhat she has become instead is exactly what James Morris wanted to become those many years ago. A girl. And worse, a forty-seven-year-old girl. And worst of all, a forty-seven-year-old Cosmopolitan girl.\u201d A lighter, much kinder version of that idea shows up in a conversation Mrs. Madrigal has with her daughter Mona in \u201cMore Tales of the City,\u201d when she explains that her chosen name turns out to be an anagram for \u201cA man and a girl.\u201d \u201cGod\u2026it\u2019s so\u2026sexist,\u201d Mona tells her mother. \u201cGirl\u2026You\u2019re a woman!\u201d \u201c _You\u2019re_ a woman, dear. I\u2019m a _girl_. And proud of it,\u201d Mrs. Madrigal replies.\u201dMy own goddamn father\u2026a sexist!\u201d Mona grouses. \u201cMy darling daughter,\u201d Mrs. Madrigal corrects her, \u201ctranssexuals can _never_ be sexists!\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The sort of rigidness about maintaining woman-only spaces with a rigid definition of what it means to be a woman shows up, with different application, in \u201cSignificant Others,\u201d when DeDe and D\u2019or, a lesbian couple go to Wimminwood, a festival that is loosely based on the real-life Michigan Womyn\u2019s Music Festival. First, their young son is deported from their tent to a separate camp for boys. Later, Rose, the head of security takes Booter Manginault, a wealthy businessman (and DeDe\u2019s stepfather) who falls asleep in his Bohemian Grove canoe and accidentally finds himself beached on Wimminwood grounds, prisoner. The sense that Booter is a threat is tangled up with Rose\u2019s objections to his business and Republican politics. \u201cRose says you make instruments of war,\u201d one of Rose\u2019s lieutenants tells him. \u201cI make aluminum honeycomb,\u201d he protests. \u201cShe says you went to Bitburg and laid wreaths on Nazi graves,\u201d the young woman tells him. \u201cThat was a _reconciliation_ gesture,\u201d Booter tries to explain. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But other than these vignettes, anti-transgender and anti-male feminism is marginal to Maupin\u2019s series, as that strain of thought is to contemporary politics. Maupin instead frees himself to focus on a variety of trans experiences, and on the relationship of trans people to the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities they are so often grouped in with. Jake Greenleaf, a young transgender man who comes to work for one of the series\u2019 protagonists, Michael Tolliver, in his gardening business, experiences both the pleasures and limitations of San Francisco as a safe haven. In the Bay area, Jake is not alone, and he is supported in having the surgeries that help bring his body into alignment with his understanding of himself. But even San Francisco is still adjusting to the idea of people like him. \u201cHe had thought that would change once he\u2019d made the leap, but so far, claiming another gender\u2013even the one that came naturally to him\u2013had merely offered new ways to feel alienated, new opportunities for humiliation,\u201d Jake reflects sadly in \u201cMary Anne In Autumn. \u201cA lot of bio guys were just in it for the novelty, losing interest altogether once their curiosity was satisfied. As for other trans guys, they were either cruising the Lone Star for liquored up bio bears or flirting with the femme dykes down at the Lexington Club. They weren\u2019t looking for Jake.\u201d Michael himself is trying to adjust to the emergence of trans men in the gay community. He and Jake initially meet in a bar, where a fellow patron takes smug pleasure in warning Michael that Jake is transgender, just as another man once informed Michael that he was flirting with someone HIV positive. These attitudes strike Michael as evidence that a community that used to pride itself on its liberation has developed its own censorious attitudes about gender and sexual responsibility. But even as Michael tries hard to avoid falling into such attitudes himself, he admits that men like Jake pose a challenge to him. \u201cThe world is changing way too fast for me with its Podcasts and pregnant strippers and macho manginas,\u201d he reflects in \u201cMichael Tolliver Lives.\u201d \u201cNo sooner have i mastered one set of directions than another comes along to replace it. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to keep up with what\u2019s going down. My only solace lies in something Anna once told me: \u2018You don\u2019t have to keep up, dear. You just have to keep open.'\u201d In a tender, absurd twist that is vintage Maupin, Jake eventually develops an erotically-charged friendship with a young Mormon missionary who hopes to rid himself of his attraction to men. \u201c\u2018Hear me out, dude,\u201d the missionary, who does not realize that Jake is transgender, tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the manliest guys I\u2019ve ever met. Not just in appearance but\u2026your manly heart and your compassion. You\u2019re the real thing, dude. You\u2019re man enough for any woman.\u201d Jake\u2019s reaction is both conflicted and sensible: \u201cHe felt flattered, insulted, humiliated and validated all at once.\u201d And Jake comes to value aspects of himself that once made him uncomfortable, achieving a new synthesis in his understanding of his identity. As he prepares for his hysterectomy\u2013a procedure that is much easier for him to obtain than Mrs. Madrigal\u2019s surgeries were in previous decades\u2013 \u201cHe wondered if losing his uterus would eliminate that, and if, in fact, he even wanted it eliminated anymore. He wanted all the man stuff, for sure, but he wouldn\u2019t mind keeping the blushing. It was his heart doing semaphore.\u201d Jake is lucky to have Anna as a mentor, and he ultimately becomes her caretaker in the final years of her life. Among the loveliest parts of the later books in the series are meditations on trans people\u2019s experiences of aging. In Maupin\u2019s \u201cSure of You,\u201d Mrs. Madrigal has a relationship with a wonderful Greek man while on vacation with her daughter Mona, but chooses to return to the United States to attend to the younger people she has considered her children. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent your whole life telling other people to live and be free,\u201d Mona protests. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stop blowing smoke and take a little of your own advice?\u201d Mrs. Madrigal acknowledges that she would enjoy the man\u2019s companionship, but she is old enough to have set her priorities. And she does not need a partner to be complete. In \u201cThe Days of Anna Madrigal,\u201d the last novel in the series, Mrs. Madrigal reflects that \u201cShe had assumed the Mrs. upon her return from Denmark in the 1960s not only to imply a respectable history but also to invent a shadow companion for her daunting new journey. She had married herself, in essence, so she would not be alone in her skin.\u201d In that book, Jake comes up with a plan to honor her at Burning Man for her contributions to the wider trans community. One of his friends, a transgender woman named Lisa, breaks down when she finds out that she is actually going to get an opportunity to meet Mrs. Madrigal: I was reminded of this passage in the novel when reading Sabrina Rubin Erdely\u2019s profile of CeCe MacDonald, a transgender woman who killed a man who attacked her in self-defense. \u201cYou rarely hear of a trans woman just living a long life and then dying of old age,\u201d MacDonald told Erdely. \u201cYou never hear, \u2018She passed on her own, natural causes, old age,\u2019 no, no, no\u2026She\u2019s either _raped_ and killed, she\u2019s jumped and killed, stalked and killed \u2013 or just killed.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Maupin did not capture all transgender experiences: he is writing mostly about two very specific transgender characters the city that is most welcoming to them. But in imagining a transgender pioneer who does not just survive into old age but thrives in it, Maupin gave all of his readers, no matter their gender identities or sexualities, a tremendous vision. Mrs. Madrigal\u2019s lessons about family, womanhood and freedom are a gift, and a call to build a world where men and women like her can offer them up to each other and the rest of us in safety.", "qid": 870, "docid": "08aec56fd1f26d9f0be58786d3e7f03f", "score": 11.09119987487793}, {"content": "Title: Front-runner to lead Justice Department civil rights defended Abercrombie in Supreme Court discrimination case Content: The front-runner to oversee the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division is a former Bush administration official and veteran conservative Washington lawyer who has represented several companies that were sued for discrimination. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recommended to the White House that Eric S. Dreiband head the civil rights division, which oversees the Justice Department\u2019s policies on issues such as voting rights, police brutality and transgender rights. In one of his most high-profile cases, Dreiband represented Abercrombie & Fitch before the Supreme Court two years ago when the clothing retailer was sued for refusing to hire a 17-year-old Muslim woman because she wore a headscarf that conflicted with the company\u2019s dress code. Abercrombie & Fitch said it didn\u2019t have a reason to know that the woman\u2019s headscarf was clothing required by her religion. In its Supreme Court brief, the company argued that people applying for jobs should not be allowed \u201cto remain silent and to assume that the employer recognizes the religious motivations behind their fashion decisions.\u201d The Supreme Court disagreed in an 8-to-1 ruling for the Muslim woman. Dreiband is a partner at Jones Day, which has at least 14 attorneys who have joined the Trump administration. At the firm, he has successfully represented tobacco company R.J. Reynolds in an age discrimination case and Bloomberg in a pregnancy discrimination case. (Dreiband is representing The Washinton Post in an age and race discrimination case in federal court in the District.) Dreiband was also involved in a recent Supreme Court case, representing the Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington, which sued the Obama administration over the contraceptive coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. The law required group health plans and issuers of health insurance to provide coverage for contraceptive methods, but there were exemptions for religious employers. Religious organizations had to certify that they had religious objections to providing the coverage. Dreiband and other Jones Day lawyers, including solicitor general nominee Noel J. Francisco, argued that the law imposed a substantial burden on religious organizations \u2014 and also made religious organizations complicit and violated their constitutional protections. The Supreme Court passed on making a decision in 2016, largely because it was still deadlocked after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. Dreiband, who is from Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Ind., received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University, where he majored in history. An offensive lineman for his college football team, he tried out unsuccessfully for the St. Louis Cardinals NFL team after graduation. He earned a master\u2019s degree in theological studies, with a concentration in ethics and public policy, from Harvard University, and a law degree in 1992 from Northwestern Law School. From 1997 to 2000, he worked for Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and led the investigation and successful prosecution of President Bill Clinton\u2019s former associate attorney general, Webster Hubbell. Under the Bush administration, he served as deputy administrator of the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division and general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Leslie Silverman, Bush-appointed vice chairman of the EEOC, said that Dreiband was \u201cwell respected by the staff.\u201d \u201cHe has incredible integrity, he\u2019s very bright and he really believes in the civil rights laws,\u201d Silverman said. At the EEOC, Dreiband was involved in another a lawsuit with Abercrombie & Fitch \u2014 but this time on the other side. In 2004, the EEOC joined a private class-action discrimination lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch, alleging that the company promoted whites at the expense of minorities. The company agreed to settle the case and was ordered to pay $40 million to black, Hispanic and Asian employees and job applicants. He also represented the commission in a suit against a meat processing plant in Chicago for discriminating against African American and women workers. The case was settled for $2.5 million. Civil rights advocates said they do not know much about Dreiband\u2019s background. Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that \u201cit will be important for the Senate to carefully review his record if he indeed is the nominee because he has been on both sides of civil rights matters.\u201d \u201cHis experience handling some civil rights matters does not answer key questions about his views on voting rights, policing reform and other core aspects of the division\u2019s work,\u201d Clarke said. Dreiband did not respond to requests for an interview. A spokesman for Jones Day also declined to comment. In 2013, Dreiband co-wrote a piece in Forbes magazine opposing \u201cban the box,\u201d an effort by civil rights advocates to prevent employers from asking about an applicant\u2019s criminal record when they apply for a job. Several companies, including Koch Industries, Walmart, and Bed Bath and Beyond have joined the ban-the-box movement in recent years. But Dreiband wrote in his article that \u201cif the government is entitled to have law-abiding workers, then surely private employers are as well.\u201d If nominated and confirmed, Dreiband would take over the division at a time when Sessions has begun to reverse Obama administration policy. In a lawsuit against Texas, the civil rights division dropped its long-standing position that Texas intended to discriminate in its strict voter ID-law \u2014 a position upheld by a federal judge in Texas two months later. In Baltimore, the division tried to delay a hearing on a sweeping police reform agreement while Sessions asked his prosecutors to review all such reform agreements with troubled police forces nationwide. And in February, the division\u2019s civil rights attorneys joined the Education Department in revoking federal guidelines specifying that transgender students have the right to use public school bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. Last month, a group of conservative lawyers wrote a letter to Sessions, urging him to rid the civil rights division of \u201cideological rot.\u201d The lawyers accused President Barack Obama\u2019s civil rights division of serving \u201cpurely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices.\u201d J. Christian Adams, who signed the letter and heads the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, said the head of the civil rights division is \u201cthe most important position\u201d Sessions will fill at the Justice Department. In response, a group of liberal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, People for the American Way and Public Citizen, wrote to Sessions, saying that \u201cthe division\u2019s career staff must not be politicized by the incoming Justice Department political appointee . . . and must be free to pursue the division\u2019s mission without inappropriate political interference.\u201d Julie Tate contributed to this report. _This story has been updated to reflect that Dreiband is representing The Washinton Post in an age and race discrimination case in federal court in the District._", "qid": 870, "docid": "a2682834-304d-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa", "score": 11.055700302124023}, {"content": "Title: Women in the running: Number of female candidates for Va. House has jumped Content: RICHMOND \u2014 Kelly Fowler\u2019s daughter was born the day Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009, but this year\u2019s birthday was a downer. Fowler and her daughter, Tessa Anne, had been enthusiastic Hillary Clinton supporters, and they couldn\u2019t bear to see President Trump sworn in on her big day. So Fowler took her little girl to the Women\u2019s March in Washington to salvage their spirits. And in the process, she decided something about herself: She was going to run for office. Fowler is now seeking to become the Democratic candidate for her House of Delegates race in Virginia Beach, where she will go up against Republican incumbent Ron Villanueva, who also faces a primary challenger, in House District 21. That makes Fowler part of a wave of female candidates in this year\u2019s elections for 100 House seats. With primary elections coming on June 13, 61 women are seeking a seat in the Virginia legislature \u2014 about 30 percent of the field. The overall crop of 206 candidates is far bigger than usual, and the number of women may be a record. The 50 women running as Democrats are the most for that party in at least a decade and probably ever \u2014 up from 27 who filed in 2015, according to the state party. Republicans are fielding 10 female candidates, and one woman is running as an independent. \u201cI think what you\u2019re seeing here is the Trump effect,\u201d said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington and a longtime Virginia election watcher who said he can\u2019t remember seeing so many women on the ballot. \u201cThere are so many people frustrated in Virginia with Trump, and that\u2019s generating a lot more candidates as well as more women candidates than we\u2019ve seen in recent cycles.\u201d In a recent poll by The Washington Post and the Schar School at George Mason University, only 36 percent of Virginia residents said they approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president. Among women, the results were even worse \u2014 29 percent said they approve of Trump and only 17 percent said they strongly approve. Two-thirds of women said they disapprove, and 61 percent strongly disapprove. Partly as a result, women\u2019s issues have featured prominently in this year\u2019s race for the Democratic nomination for governor. Both of the party\u2019s candidates \u2014 Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello \u2014 have campaigned on promising to be a \u201cbrick wall\u201d against attempts by Trump or the Republican-controlled state legislature to roll back access to abortion or otherwise restrict women\u2019s health issues. But it\u2019s the outpouring of interest from female candidates that best captures the spirit of the moment, said Stephanie Schriock, president of the women\u2019s political group Emily\u2019s List. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a real empowerment of women to step up and want their voices heard in all aspects of society, and that particularly means elective office,\u201d Schriock said. \u201cThere are many reasons \u2014 one clearly is the election of Donald Trump and what that means to a lot of women in their gut who say, \u2018Wait a minute, if that can happen, I\u2019ve got to take charge and get involved myself.\u2019 \u201d Emily\u2019s List waded into the Virginia races Tuesday, endorsing Fowler and six other House candidates, including Danica Roem in House District 13 in Prince William County. She would be the first transgender person elected to the General Assembly. All of the seven are Democrats. The national group, which also has endorsed Susan Platt for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor, promises to bring attention and fundraising power to their campaigns. The others on their slate are Hala Ayala in HD51 in Prince William; Jennifer Carroll Foy in HD2 in Prince William; Wendy Gooditis in HD10 in Loudoun; Kathleen Murphy in HD34 in Fairfax; and Cheryl Turpin in HD85 in Virginia Beach. Of the 61 women running for office in the Virginia House primaries, 12 are Democratic incumbents and four are Republican incumbents. Many Virginia incumbents go years without challengers, and as districts have become more polarized, Democrats have sometimes struggled to field challengers in very red parts of the state. Not this year, though: All but 16 House races feature candidates from both parties, and women account for more than half of all challengers seeking seats held by Republicans. At least four contested races feature only women, but that number could rise once the general election candidates are selected. And there were actually five more women candidates who have already been winnowed out in districts that used a nominating process. \u201cThe Trump effect might have been a good thing in the long run,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cEveryone is awake and paying attention and taking a stand.\u201d But even with the surge of interest from women, Virginia still has a long way to go for gender parity in the state legislature. There were 17 women among the 100 members of the House of Delegates in the most recent session. Factoring in the Senate, which is not up for reelection this year and features 10 women among its 40 members, Virginia\u2019s General Assembly is about 19 percent female. That\u2019s below this year\u2019s average of about 25 percent for statehouses across the country, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Vermont, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona all lead the way with legislatures that are about 39 percent women. Of course, women make up more than half of the population they represent.", "qid": 870, "docid": "a4eaeffc-3fd8-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582", "score": 10.981100082397461}, {"content": "Title: A transgender candidate takes on Virginia\u2019s \u2018minister of private parts\u2019 Content: Traffic. Schools. Jobs. Getting to their jobs, so back to traffic. That\u2019s what Northern Virginia voters want to talk about when a transgender woman with a rainbow headscarf and slashing black eyeliner knocks on their door. Which is weird. Because given all the legislation proposed in the Virginia General Assembly on these constituents\u2019 behalf, you would think the conversations would be nothing but bathrooms, abortions and sex when someone such as Danica Roem shows up. Roem, 32, has made history, becoming the first openly transgender candidate to win a state primary in Virginia. Now, the Democratic nominee is trying to unseat her polar opposite in the 13th District: 25-year incumbent Del. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William). And she believes she can win exactly because she has little interest in talking about sex, body parts or gender identity \u2014 the meat and potatoes of Marshall\u2019s public life. In a rapidly developing part of the state that desperately needs a traffic czar, Marshall instead styles himself as Virginia\u2019s self-appointed \u201cMinister of Private Parts.\u201d He belongs to the party of small government, yet his legislative record is all about people\u2019s sexual and reproductive behavior. Over the course of his career, he has questioned the intelligence of women who use long-term contraception, argued that some incest is voluntary, pushed for women to be legally required to have transvaginal ultrasounds before abortions, suggested that children born with disabilities are the punishment for women who have had abortions, worried that U.S. troops would catch sexually transmitted diseases if they had to serve alongside gay men and women, called for transgender service members to be kicked out of the military and authored a vicious transgender bathroom bill that would allow the government to dictate where someone can pee. Marshall\u2019s ironically named Physical Privacy Act was based on his fear that men and boys would pretend to be transgender to infiltrate bathrooms and locker rooms used by women and girls. \u201cSome guys will use anything to make a move on some teenage girls or women,\u201d he said. And here comes his opponent in a district that backed Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in last year\u2019s presidential election: a transgender woman who sings in a metal band, has a boyfriend and doesn\u2019t make it a point to talk about any of it. \u201cTraffic. Jobs. Schools, in that order,\u201d Roem said about her platform and her issues. \u201cAnd equality.\u201d \u201cOf course. I put equality on there because,\u201d and she gestured along the length of her royal blue sheath dress, \u201cthis race will be different.\u201d She doesn\u2019t shy away from her identity. The scarf she wears when she canvasses is a big, fat pride rainbow. The story of her transition and medical treatments is on her Web page. But, unlike her opponent, she doesn\u2019t think Manassas residents stay awake at night worrying about which bathroom she should use. She isn\u2019t running because she\u2019s transgender and wants to fight Marshall\u2019s craziness. No, she is running because of what she learned at work. Roem is a local news reporter. And for about a decade, she has spent thousands of hours at local government hearings and meetings, poring over planning and zoning documents, proposed legislation and bids for public works projects. She\u2019s a policy nerd. You try to get a quick yes or no about an issue, and instead you get the memorized 25-year history of a traffic corridor, with the pinpoint details of costs, dates, traffic studies, estimates, rates and efficiencies. She\u2019s not big into talking points or 140-character sound bites. \u201cWow. I\u2019m impressed, you really know your details,\u201d said Denise Coleman, 28, after she opened her door to Roem\u2019s barrage of details on traffic. Roem wasn\u2019t there to talk about behind-closed-doors morality or to fight a culture war or to get Coleman to understand the two-decade, gut-wrenching journey of a transgender woman. Nope. Roem did a straight-from-memory deep dive into why Coleman\u2019s commute sucks and how it can be fixed. And Coleman loved it. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThis is what matters.\u201d Roem was on a roll. \u201cThink you\u2019d like a yard sign?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell, not really,\u201d Coleman said, looking down at her feet, avoiding Roem\u2019s eyes. \u201cMy mom lives here, and, you know, she\u2019s Catholic.\u201d Roem talked about all the Catholic education she has had \u2014 13 years \u2014 but didn\u2019t push it. She hasn\u2019t been positioning herself as some sort of standard-bearer for LGBT rights. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until that bizarre Trump tweet last week that called for a ban on transgender service members in the military that Roem went on the offensive on the issue. \u201cFor our president, who opted out of serving in the military, to attack transgender people for being unfit to serve . . . is the height of hypocrisy,\u201d Roem told my colleague, Fenit Nirappil. \u201cTransgender military members . . . have done more to serve and protect their country than Donald Trump ever will.\u201d Roem got a $50,000 donation from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele, who chairs the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and was in Washington when Trump issued his military ban. \u201cYou, my dear, are on everyone\u2019s lips across the nation,\u201d said Pam Northam, wife of Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam, when she visited Roem\u2019s headquarters in Manassas for an ice cream social Sunday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m such a fan, I couldn\u2019t wait to meet her,\u201d Northam confessed to me after she and Roem hugged, smiled for the camera and talked about the knots in their stomachs both get before knocking on each door they hit. Before heading out for Sunday evening\u2019s door-knocking \u2014 they\u2019ve hit 16,000 doors so far, and Roem leaves a personal, handwritten note for each constituent she doesn\u2019t get to talk to \u2014 she met with her staff to get a field report. \u201cIs anyone talking about the transgender ban?\u201d Roem asked one of her organizers, Brad Chester. \u201cNot really,\u201d Chester said. \u201cMaybe one person. Power lines, people really wanted to talk about power lines.\u201d And she headed out for another round of discussion about traffic, schools, property values, jobs.

Elected officials from Seattle to San Francisco to New York have ordered their employees to steer clear of the state. Big businesses like American Airlines and Wells Fargo have said they are worried about the law. Small businesses have said they will skip conventions in North Carolina. The NBA even hinted it might move its 2017 All-Star Game, scheduled to take place in Charlotte. And then there\u2019s the federal lawsuit filed against North Carolina by two transgender individuals and an array of civil liberties groups. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But the issue only reached full fiasco level on Tuesday, when, in equally fiery statements, the state\u2019s Republican governor and its Democratic Attorney General lambasted one another. \u201cNot only is this new law a national embarrassment, it will set North Carolina\u2019s economy back,\u201d said Roy Cooper, the AG, who also refused to defend the state against the lawsuit. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about discrimination here,\u201d he said. Shortly after Cooper\u2019s dramatic press conference, Gov. Pat McCrory \u2014 who signed the law March 23 and has staunchly defended it \u2014 accused Cooper of breaking his oath of office. \u201cAs the state\u2019s attorney, he can\u2019t select which laws he will defend and which laws are politically expedient to refuse to defend,\u201d McCrory said in a video statement. One GOP state senator called on Cooper to resign. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Underlying the spat is the fact that Cooper and McCrory will face off in the November election, considered one of the most competitive and crucial gubernatorial races in the country. As criticism of the law intensifies inside and outside North Carolina, it increasingly appears as if the state will have to wait until Election Day to resolve its expanding rift over the issue. The saga began last month when Charlotte, North Carolina\u2019s largest city, passed a sweeping civil rights ordinance. The left-leaning city\u2019s ordinance expanded protections for individuals on the basis of marital status, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression. Among those protections: a guarantee that transgender people would be allowed to use their preferred restroom. Even before Charlotte\u2019s city council had voted 7-4 to pass the ordinance, however, McCrory \u2014 a former mayor of Charlotte \u2014 was promising to override it. \u201cThe only issue I think the state needs to be involved in is the issue regarding locker rooms and restrooms, that\u2019s the one that draws concern that has ramifications beyond city limits,\u201d McCrory said in an email to council members, according to ABC11. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico He wasn\u2019t alone in his opposition. At the time of the vote, more than 12,000 people had signed an online petition concerned the ordinance would encumber small business owners and put women and children at risk in Charlotte bathrooms. But supporters called that argument absurd. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfortunate because it\u2019s a myth,\u201d Devin Lentz, a Raleigh resident and transgender woman, told ABC11. \u201cThe idea that it\u2019s a danger or that it\u2019s something people need to worry about because it poses a threat is, it\u2019s just not true.\u201d Lentz said that the bathroom issue was real, but that the danger was the other way around. \u201cIf you take a transgender woman and force her to go into the men\u2019s room, which appears to be what the governor wants to do, what you\u2019re going to do is put her in danger, she\u2019s much more likely to be assaulted and harassed,\u201d she said. \u201cTransgender people, especially transgender women are assaulted, harassed, raped, murdered at really heartbreaking levels.\u201d McCrory\u2019s call for a state law overriding the Charlotte ordinance had the overwhelming support from his party. The only problem: the legislature wasn\u2019t in session. Moreover, it wasn\u2019t scheduled to reconvene until after the Charlotte ordinance went into effect. So, on March 21, leaders of the Republican-controlled legislature invoked a seldom-used constitutional provision to call themselves into session just two days later. \u201cWe aim to repeal this ordinance before it goes into effect to provide for the privacy and protection of the women and children of our state,\u201d Lt. Gov. Dan Forest and House Speaker Tim Moore said in a joint statement announcing the special one-day session, which cost the state cost $42,000. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Comments on local news websites captured the deep divides in the state. \u201cWe are lucky to have legislators willing to protect taxpayers who have to take a leak in Charlotte,\u201d wrote one man. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t. Transgender people need protection, and they are about to take it away,\u201d responded another person. \u201cTransgender people don\u2019t need protection. They need help to stop pretending they are something they are not and can never ever be no matter what has been added or removed,\u201d chimed in a third. \u201cI hate to break this to you but you are probably already using public restrooms with transgendered people,\u201d replied a fourth person. \u201cAre you really that concerned if someone squats when urinating?\u201d On March 23, a bizarre and frantic day at the Raleigh statehouse, the legislature passed the bill. Although a handful of Democratic representatives voted in favor, Democratic state senators walked out of the chamber in protest. \u201cWe choose not to participate in this farce,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said, according to CBS. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That same night, McCrory signed the bill into law. In doing so, McCrory set himself apart from a handful of Republican governors across the country who have recently vetoed or promised to veto similar measures. On March 1, South Dakota\u2019s Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have been the first in the nation to restrict transgender students\u2019 access to school restrooms and locker rooms. Daugaard said the statewide mandate \u201cdoes not address any pressing issue concerning the school districts of South Dakota.\u201d \u201cInstead of encouraging local solutions, this bill broadly regulates in a manner that invites conflict and litigation, diverting energy and resources from the education of the children of this state,\u201d he continued. On Monday, Georgia\u2019s GOP governor came to a similar conclusion, promising to veto a similar bill. \u201cI have examined the protections that this bill proposes to provide to the faith based community and I can find no examples of any of those circumstances occurring in our state,\u201d announced Nathan Deal. \u201cI do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia.\u201d That leaves North Carolina as the first, and so far only, state to pass such a measure. Local newspapers have rejected the title in disgust. In an editorial ominously titled \u201cMcCrory joins a dark list of Southern governors,\u201d the Charlotte Observer shamed the governor. \u201cThis week, as then, North Carolina needed a leader who understood the damage this law might do \u2014 most importantly to its vulnerable citizens, but also to the face we present to businesses and workers considering our state,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cInstead we got a late-night bill signing Wednesday and some campaign tweets. We got a state newly stained, and a governor joining a sorrowful list of those who decided not to lead us forward, but to bow to the worst in us.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The Daily Tar Heel went further. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cThis bill is wrong beyond repair,\u201d wrote the University of North Carolina\u2019s student paper. \u201cThis law is a chapter in America\u2019s horror story.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the Charlotte mayor who championed the anti-discrimination ordinance blasted the law. The General Assembly is on the wrong side of progress,\u201d said Jennifer Roberts. \u201cIt is on the wrong side of history.\u201d That argument was bolstered by a cascade of city and state officials from across the country, who said they were ordering their employees to avoid nonessential publicly funded travel to North Carolina. \u201cWe are standing united as San Franciscans to condemn North Carolina\u2019s new discriminatory law that turns back the clock on protecting the rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,\u201d said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee in a statement released last Friday. Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo followed suit on Monday. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cIn New York, we believe that all people \u2014 regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation \u2014 deserve the same rights and protections under the law,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement. \u201cFrom Stonewall to marriage equality, our state has been a beacon of hope and equality for the LGBT community, and we will not stand idly by as misguided legislation replicates the discrimination of the past.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Even the White House weighed in, calling the N.C. law \u201cmean-spirited.\u201d That same day, The American Civil Liberties Union, along with LGBT advocacy groups Lambda Legal and Equality North Carolina, filed a federal lawsuit against North Carolina on behalf of two transgender people and a lesbian law school professor. \u201cLawmakers made no attempt to cloak their actions in a veneer of neutrality, instead openly and virulently attacking transgender people, who were falsely portrayed as predatory and dangerous to others,\u201d the lawsuit claims. Cooper, who as AG is one of the defendants on the suit, announced on Tuesday that his office would not defend the state in the suit. He said that he had defended laws that he didn\u2019t agree with in the past, but this time was different. \u201cThis is a unique and different situation, and as attorney general there are often times situations where you have to make choices with different agencies that are conflicted,\u201d he said in his press conference. \u201cHere, this is the right choice.\u201d Cooper said that the law conflicted with his own office\u2019s non-discrimination policies, and that the bathroom restrictions were already hurting the state\u2019s economy. \u201cWe know that businesses here and all over the country have taken a strong stance in opposition to this law,\u201d he said. Republican State Sen. Phil Berger called on Cooper to quit. \u201cHe is telling everybody that it\u2019s more important to him to apply for and work towards the job he wants than the job he has,\u201d Berger said, according to ABC11. \u201cIf he wants to run for governor, he\u2019s perfectly free to do that. But he can\u2019t do that and ignore the job he\u2019s being paid for now.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Gov. McCrory also accused Cooper of playing politics. \u201cSome have called our state an embarrassment. The real embarrassment is politicians not publicly respecting each other\u2019s positions on complex issues,\u201d he said. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cNorth Carolina has been the target of a vicious, nation-wide smear campaign,\u201d McCrory continued. \u201cDisregarding the facts, other politicians, from the White House to mayors and city council members and yes our Attorney General, have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda. Even if it means defying the constitution and their oath of office.\u201d Polls taken before the transgender law turmoil showed the gubernatorial race as neck-and-neck. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It\u2019s unclear how the dueling politicians\u2019 defiant positions have affected the outlook.

The evidence is more than anecdotal. Although hate-motivated violence against LGBT Americans dropped precipitously in 2014, similar violence rose 13 percent for transgender people, according to a report by the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP). *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico According to NCAVP, America\u2019s transgender minority is by far the most at-risk population when it comes to being victims of violence. The reasons are complex but can be traced to lingering stigmas attached by many to transgender people, Sasha Buchert, staff attorney at the Transgender Law Center, told Yahoo Health. Only 18 states have nondiscrimination policies towards trans individuals, meaning that \u201cin 32 states you can be fired for just being who you are,\u201d she said. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That discrimination puts many trans people in a precarious position where they can\u2019t get the documents they need and sometimes turn to more dangerous, off-the-books employment, Buchert told Yahoo. \u201cThese same individuals are then often the targets of the violent hate crimes and murders previously mentioned, made additionally vulnerable for either being sex workers or being perceived to be sex workers,\u201d she said. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Even worse, trans victims, their families or their friends often have to fight law enforcement to recognize their preferred gender. Take the most recent trans death: victim No. 13 this year. Shade Schuler apparently chose to live life as a woman, but Dallas police described her as a man. Supporters took to social media to praise the woman they called Ms. Shade. \u201cRest in power, sweet angel,\u201d one wrote. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But many more expressed their anger at the continued killing of trans women in America. \u201cThis is just so crazy,\u201d wrote another Shade supporter. \u201cIt seems like you can\u2019t go one week without finding out another sister was murdered.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico _Correction: Citing another news source, an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of an activist from the National Center for Transgender Equality.

After a series of attempts to come to an agreement, the Senate voted down a bill to repeal the law and the House adjourned without acting. They are both scheduled to convene next in January. \u201cToday, the public trust has been betrayed once again. Lawmakers sent a clear message: North Carolina remains closed for business,\u201d Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats, who rejected a version of the repeal that would have included a six-month moratorium on cities passing nondiscrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people. They also blamed the governor-elect, Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who had paved the way for repeal by negotiating an agreement with the city of Charlotte to pull back a nondiscrimination ordinance it had enacted earlier this year. \u201cMake no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal\u201d of the bill, Senate Leader Phil Berger (R) said in a statement. \u201cTheir action proves they only wanted a repeal in order to force radical social engineering and shared bathrooms across North Carolina, at the expense of our state\u2019s families, our reputation and our economy.\u201d The half-measure proposed Wednesday did not satisfy gay and transgender rights groups, who pledged to continue to fight a state law that they had criticized as one of the most discriminatory in the nation. \u201cIt is unacceptable. It\u2019s a gimmick. It\u2019s H.B. 2.0,\u201d said Mara Keisling, president of the National Center for Transgender Equality. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay and any legislature that would do that wouldn\u2019t really be doing that for only six months.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, the Charlotte City Council held an emergency meeting to repeal its own ordinance in full, a move meant to spur state lawmakers into action. A spokeswoman for the city said the repeal vote Monday had affected only the part of the ordinance dealing with public accommodations, such as bathrooms, which council members thought would \u201csufficiently [fulfill] the requests of the general assembly\u201d and lead to H.B. 2\u2019s repeal. Some state Republicans were critical of Charlotte for its partial repeal. Dallas Woodhouse, executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party, posted a statement on Facebook saying that Cooper and the Charlotte City Council \u201clied to the public about a full repeal,\u201d and his group went on to call this a \u201cdishonest, disgraceful shame.\u201d Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts (D) pushed back against the party\u2019s statement, saying in an email to The Washington Post that the state GOP \u201cis incorrect and they need to stop playing politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d In a statement Wednesday night, the city of Charlotte said officials there are \u201cdisappointed with this unfortunate outcome.\u201d \u201cThe Charlotte City Council acted in good faith to do everything it understood was needed to necessitate the state legislature repealing HB2,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished,\u201d Forest, a supporter of H.B. 2, said in a statement Wednesday morning. Opponents of expanded transgender rights say that allowing explicit protections, particularly in the public sphere, not only breaks with long-standing social mores when it comes to gender and bathrooms but could open the door to sexual predators gaining access to women\u2019s restrooms. Rights groups, however, contend that such arguments are rooted in offensive stereotypes and do not reflect the reality of most transgender people, who have already been quietly using their preferred bathrooms without incident. After the bathroom bill was signed, musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled shows in North Carolina, while Cirque de Soleil scrapped several performances in the state. The NBA, which has a franchise in Charlotte, moved this season\u2019s All-Star Game from that city because of \u201cthe climate created by\u201d H.B. 2. The NCAA took even more extensive action, relocating the seven championship games set to take place in North Carolina during this season, including two rounds of the lucrative men\u2019s Division I basketball tournament. Big businesses, including Google and Apple, spoke out against the law. PayPal, a California-based online payment firm, and Deutsche Bank, a German financial giant, called off planned expansions in North Carolina.

The daughter of a Hungarian political exile, B\u2019Racz is a woman who is cowed by little. In the face of opposition, she often prevails. She opened Malaprop\u2019s Bookstore and Cafe in 1982, when Asheville was a place well worth driving past, a boarded-up burg of pawn and porn emporiums, slowly withering in a Blue Ridge Mountain valley. \u201cI had no money and no business experience,\u201d she recalls, and yet she helped lead this town\u2019s revival to become the popular tourist and life\u2019s-next-chapter destination it is today. Along the way, she deflected criticism from all quarters: from lesbians for not operating a gay bookstore (she\u2019s gay) and military buffs for omitting military history (\u201cNot my thing\u201d). Malaprop\u2019s has endured protests from Zionists (about Jeff Halper\u2019s \u201cWar Against the People: Israel, the Palestinians and Global Pacification\u201d), evangelical Christians (in response to Reza Aslan\u2019s \u201cZealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d) and, memorably, enraged vegans, who prompted a police presence at a sidewalk event for Fred Thompson\u2019s \u201cBarbecue Nation\u201d \u2014 in North Carolina, where barbecue is a matter of faith. \u201cWe are a place where freedom of speech is honored,\u201d says B\u2019Racz, who views books and her store as \u201cgood medicine,\u201d both for society and for whatever ails you. But nothing prepared her for the economic fallout from the \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d In March, the state legislature passed HB2 \u2014 officially the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act, but known to all as the bathroom bill. It mandates, among other provisions, that transgender individuals use public restrooms corresponding to the gender on their birth certificates. Within days, North Carolina became the place not to visit but to strenuously avoid, and an economic boycott went into full throttle. Bruce Springsteen and Selena Gomez canceled shows, film and television productions relocated, PayPal put its planned expansion into the state on hold, and the NBA is considering a change of venue for the 2017 All-Star Game. Five states and more than a dozen municipalities banned their employees from making nonessential trips to North Carolina. Malaprop\u2019s is the sort of store where readers visit for an hour, settling into the wooden chairs, some of them child-size, scattered among the concrete posts decorated as trees. Named 2000 Bookseller of the Year by Publisher\u2019s Weekly, it\u2019s home to multiple book clubs (like WILD, Women in Lively Discussion) and almost daily events throughout town. In 1999, when B\u2019Racz moved down the block to a space more than double the size, the community volunteered to move boxes of books, forming a bucket brigade to pass them down Haywood Street. Out-of-town visitors are essential to her business. But after HB2, sales slumped in April, and again in May, \u201cat a time when they\u2019re up for other independent bookstores,\u201d says B\u2019Racz. \u201cOur business is off on a day-to-day basis.\u201d Tourists who couldn\u2019t cancel their trips would walk into Malaprop\u2019s and other shops in town and announce that they weren\u2019t spending money. Then the big blow: Even as sales were falling, popular authors Sherman Alexie and Mark Z. Danielewski canceled readings. The Alexie cancellation, tied to the children\u2019s illustrated book \u201cThunder Boy Jr.,\u201d hit especially hard; the schedule included a reading at a local theater and school events, and a projected sale of 500 books. Says B\u2019Racz, \u201cLots of children were denied the chance to get to know him.\u201d Danielewski wrote B\u2019Racz an apologetic note, but Alexie canceled through his publicist and offered no explanation except a tweet: \u201cIn honor and support of the LGBT community, I am cancelling all upcoming events in North Carolina. #RepealHB2.\u201d \u201cI have very little patience with stupidity,\u201d says B\u2019Racz, who\u2019s still furious with Alexie. \u201cThere are other ways of protesting and making an impact.\u201d She wanted to strip the novelist\u2019s books from the shelves, but the staff persuaded her not to, although everyone laments the burden on the bookstore, which is vehemently opposed to HB2. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for what happened,\u201d says manager Linda-Marie Barrett, who has worked at Malaprop\u2019s for 28 years and wrote a New York Times op-ed decrying the law\u2019s effect on the store\u2019s business. \u201cIt took us years to build up our author events and get them to come here.\u201d In LGBT-friendly Asheville, where Bernie Sanders won more primary votes than all the Republican presidential candidates combined, it\u2019s difficult to find anyone who supports HB2, yet almost everyone seems to be affected. Although it draws national attention to a cause, an economic boycott can be punitive to small businesses in a vacation destination like Asheville, where one in seven jobs is tourism-related. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly heartening to see large business and big-name entertainers take a very public stand with the transgender community that feels groundbreaking,\u201d says Zeke Christopoulos, co-founder of the transgender advocacy group Tranzmission and the face of an anti-HB2 web ad. \u201cBut as a banker and activist who deals with a lot of smaller businesses that are reporting diminished income, some as high as 30 percent, [I see] that [it] hurts their vision and their future.\u201d More than $1 million in hotel bookings have been canceled due to HB2, according to the visitors bureau, and business owners such as B\u2019Racz worry about the vital summer season, which is Christmas in terms of sales for this town of 88,000. Filmmaker Erin Derham had $1.1 million in pledged funding yanked by a tech company that didn\u2019t want to do business in North Carolina. \u201cIt was pretty abrupt,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone stopped answering my emails.\u201d Now, she\u2019s making shorts for the tourism board, urging folks to visit. Asheville is a mecca for top buskers (as well as lesser ones), the subject of an earlier film, but Derham says they\u2019ve stayed away so far. \u201cThe money and tourists are not here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re being twice punished,\u201d says Luke Broussard, manager of Early Girl Eatery, known for its biscuits and farm-to-table Southern food. \u201cFirst with the legislation, which was over before we knew it was happening, and now with the boycott.\u201d Store-studded streets like charming Wall and funky, patchouli-scented Lexington, usually thronged with tourists and buskers in June, are relatively empty. On a recent weeknight, Nightbell restaurant, acclaimed for its craft cocktails and waffles topped with duck confit, was deserted. Since 2011, Liz Button, whose family owns Nightbell and the Spanish tapas restaurant C\u00farate, had watched business explode, up 22 percent each year, only to see sales stall in April and dip in May, when visitors usually flock to Asheville. Button, who moved here from New Jersey to launch the business and employs 100 people, is no fan of the boycott. \u201cMost people are appalled. The decision not to come hurts across the board,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody wants to go back to the 1970s and \u201980s, when everything was shuttered.\u201d Although it\u2019s well south of the Mason-Dixon line, Asheville, residents argue, is not what outsiders think of when they think of the South. Consider it a smaller, more affordable Berkeley, they say \u2014 a progressive, diversity-embracing enclave. \u201cYou\u2019re not in North Carolina \u2014 just yet,\u201d Broussard tells tourists who marvel at the town\u2019s River Arts District, food culture and hipster population. \u201cHead 10 miles in any direction.\u201d Yet many parts of the state and the South have also changed. Charlotte passed a nondiscrimination ordinance in February that included protections for the LGBT community. That measure motivated the state General Assembly in Raleigh to pass HB2 a month later. In presidential elections, North Carolina is a tossup: Obama won narrowly in 2008 and Romney barely in 2012.

(She won the Democratic primary and is running unopposed in the general election.) \u201cBut if everyone leaves when they turn 18, as historically many gay residents did, we won\u2019t have equality,\u201d she says. North Carolina is home to 336,000 LGBT residents, according to one survey. Of them, 37,800 are transgender.

It\u2019s slower, for sure,\u201d says SB, who moved to Asheville from Mobile, Ala., in 2001. After the bathroom bill, the shop printed more than 1,000 \u201cDon\u2019t Legislate Hate\u201d T-shirts, distributing them free to the community that has made SB and general manager Bernard Stephens, who identifies as genderqueer, welcome for years.

SB understands that \u201cboycotts quickly raise awareness, but the right response is not to be knee-jerk. Visit North Carolina.

An Education Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The letter was signed by parents from Texas, Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Maine and D.C. They are members of the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Parents for Transgender Equality Council, and many of them have become leading voices in the effort to raise awareness about and advocate for the needs of transgender people. \u201cWe are continuing to fight,\u201d Ron Ford Jr. said Wednesday, the day Trump withdrew the guidance, at a rally in support of transgender children in front of the White House. Ford\u2019s short speech was captured on video and posted to Facebook. \u201cEveryone needs to be protected in school, in their communities. Just because they rescinded the guidance \u2026 doesn\u2019t meant that we all stop. We do not stop.\u201d The Obama-era guidance specified not only that transgender children should be allowed to use bathrooms matching their gender identity, but also how schools should navigate questions about which names and pronouns to use and which athletic team a child should be permitted to join. Many parents of transgender children embraced the guidance, saying that it made them feel as if Washington cared about \u2014 and was willing to protect \u2014 their children. But the guidance also triggered a backlash from parents, activists and elected officials who argued that allowing transgender students access to restrooms matching their identity would violate the privacy and dignity of other students. More than a dozen states sued to block the guidance, and in August, a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction temporarily prohibiting the federal government from enforcing it. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will have to decide whether Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in federally funded schools, protects transgender students. A decision could come as early as this year in a case involving a transgender teen who sued his Virginia school board after he was barred from using the boys\u2019 restroom at school. DeShanna Neal, of Wilmington, Del., said she hopes Trump and his Cabinet secretaries will be willing to listen to parents. Neal began home-schooling her daughter in kindergarten out of fear for her safety in schools that weren\u2019t prepared to address her needs. Her daughter is now 13 and plans to attend high school next year. \u201cI want to sit down with Trump and DeVos and Sessions and say look, when I gave birth to my child, never in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d have to fight for her equal rights. I just assumed she\u2019d have them because she is a human being,\u201d Neal said. Instead, she said, she worries about the discrimination her daughter may face not only because she is transgender, but also because she is black. \u201cI want them to understand that she belongs here. My daughter is a person, she\u2019s an American.

(Working title: \u201cThe Pompadours of 1600 Pennsylvania.\u201d) But even as the cocksure sycophant\u2019s gobsmacking spectacle stole the show, something of real importance took place a bit lower on the radar. At five separate junctures, the sinews of our democracy held against the careening recklessness of this presidency. Consequently, Donald Trump\u2019s worst week proved a particularly fine hour for American democracy: 1. The military says no to Trump on the transgender ban. Well, not directly \u2014 that\u2019s insubordination \u2014 but with rather elegant circumspection. The president tweeted out a total ban on transgender people serving in the military. It came practically out of nowhere. (A House vote to continue funding for sex-change operations may have triggered Trump\u2019s blanket ban.) The military brass, not consulted, were not amused. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, in the middle of a six-month review of the issue, was reportedly appalled. What was done? Nothing. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs simply declared that a tweet is not an order. Until he receives a formal command and develops new guidelines, the tweet will be ignored. In other words, the military told the commander in chief to go jump in a lake. Generally speaking, this is not a healthy state of affairs in a nation of civilian control. It does carry a whiff of insubordination. But under a president so uniquely impulsive and chronically irrational, a certain vigilance, even prickliness, on the part of the military is to be welcomed. The brass framed their inaction as a matter of procedure. But the refusal carried with it a reminder of institutional prerogatives. In this case, the military offered resistance to mere whimsy. Next time, it could be resistance to unlawfulness. 2. The Senate saves Sessions. Trump\u2019s relentless public humiliation of Attorney General Jeff Sessions was clearly intended to get him to resign. He didn\u2019t, in part because of increasing support from Congress. We discount here the solemn praise Sessions garnered from hypocritical Democrats who just weeks ago were denouncing him as an unreconstructed racist. Sessions\u2019 former Republican colleagues came out strongly in his defense and some openly criticized the president\u2019s shabby treatment of his first and most fervent senatorial supporter. Indeed, Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned Trump not to fire Sessions because he wouldn\u2019t get another attorney general \u2014 the committee\u2019s entire 2017 schedule was set and there would be no hearings to approve a new AG. That was a finger to the eye of the president. Every once in a while, the Senate seems to remember that it belongs to a coequal branch. 3. Senate Republicans reject the Obamacare repeal. The causes here are multiple, most having nothing to do with Trump. Republicans are deeply divided on the proper role of government in health care. This division is compounded by the sea change in public opinion as, over seven years, Obamacare has become part of the fabric of American medicine, and health care has come to be seen as a right rather than a commodity. Nonetheless, the stunning Senate rejection of repeal was also a pointed rejection of Trump\u2019s health-care hectoring. And a show of senatorial disdain for Trump craving a personal legislative \u201cwin\u201d on an issue about whose policy choices he knew nothing and cared less. 4. The Boy Scouts protest. In a rebuke not as earthshaking but still telling, the chief executive of the Boy Scouts found it necessary to apologize for the president\u2019s speech last week to their quadrennial jamboree. It was a wildly inappropriate confection, at once whining, self-referential, partisan and political. How do you blow a speech to Boy Scouts? No merit badge for the big guy. 5. The police chiefs chide. In an address to law enforcement officials, Trump gave a wink and a nod to cops roughing up suspects. Several police chiefs subsequently reprimanded Trump for encouraging police brutality \u2014 a mild form, perhaps, but brutality still. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was all a joke. Nonsense. It was an ugly sentiment, expressed coyly enough to be waved away as humor but with the thuggish undertone of a man who, heckled at a campaign rally, once said approvingly that in the old days \u201cguys like that\u201d would \u201cbe carried out on a stretcher.\u201d Whatever your substantive position on the various issues involved above, we should all be grateful that from the generals to the Scouts, from the senators to the cops, the institutions of both political and civil society are holding up well.

Just days earlier, it appeared that North Carolina could scrap the law after months of criticism. Instead, the status quo remained in place. After a series of attempts to come to an agreement, the Senate voted down a bill to repeal the law, and the House adjourned without acting. They are scheduled to convene next in January. \u201cToday, the public trust has been betrayed once again. Lawmakers sent a clear message: North Carolina remains closed for business,\u201d Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. Republicans, meanwhile, blamed Democrats, who rejected a version of the repeal that would have included a six-month moratorium on cities passing nondiscrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people. They also blamed the governor-elect, Attorney General Roy Cooper (D), who had paved the way for repeal by negotiating an agreement with the city of Charlotte to pull back a nondiscrimination ordinance it had enacted earlier this year. \u201cMake no mistake: Roy Cooper and Senate Democrats killed the repeal\u201d of the law, Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger (R) said in a statement. \u201cTheir action proves they only wanted a repeal in order to force radical social engineering and shared bathrooms across North Carolina, at the expense of our state\u2019s families, our reputation and our economy.\u201d Speaking to reporters late Wednesday, Cooper assailed Republicans for the day\u2019s developments. \u201cThe Republican legislative leaders have broken their word to me, and they have broken their trust with the people of North Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was our best chance. It cannot be our last chance.\u201d \u201cLegislative leaders in North Carolina have proven their dishonesty time and time again, and they proved it again today,\u201d Mara Keisling, president of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement Wednesday night. \u201cThey broke their promise to repeal this harmful bill, and then tried to ram through a halfway measure instead \u2014 and failed to do that as well.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, the Charlotte City Council had held an emergency meeting to repeal its ordinance in full, a move meant to spur state lawmakers into action. A spokeswoman for the city said the initial repeal vote Monday had affected only the part of the ordinance dealing with public accommodations, such as bathrooms, which council members thought would \u201csufficiently [fulfill] the requests of the General Assembly\u201d and lead to H.B. 2\u2019s repeal. In a statement issued Wednesday night after state legislators failed to repeal H.B. 2, the city said officials there are \u201cdisappointed with this unfortunate outcome.\u201d \u201cThe Charlotte City Council acted in good faith to do everything it understood was needed to necessitate the state legislature repealing HB2,\u201d the statement said. When the council repealed part of its ordinance Monday, it stated that the measure would be restored if H.B. 2 were left in place by Dec. 31. That deadline was not included in the city\u2019s repeal Wednesday, a Charlotte spokeswoman said. \u201cThe names will change, but the national groups who are pushing this agenda will not stop until their social engineering is accomplished,\u201d Forest, a supporter of H.B. 2, said in a statement Wednesday morning. Opponents of expanded transgender rights say that allowing explicit protections, particularly in the public sphere, not only breaks with long-standing social mores when it comes to gender and bathrooms but also could open the door to sexual predators gaining access to women\u2019s restrooms. Rights groups, however, say that such arguments are rooted in offensive stereotypes and do not reflect the reality of most transgender people, who have already been using their preferred bathrooms without incident. After the bathroom bill was signed, musicians including Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled shows in North Carolina, while Cirque du Soleil scrapped several performances in the state. The NBA moved this season\u2019s All-Star Game, while the NCAA took more extensive action, relocating the seven championship games set to take place in North Carolina this season, including two rounds of the men\u2019s Division I basketball tournament. Businesses including Google and Apple spoke out against the law. PayPal, a California-based online payment firm, and Deutsche Bank, a German financial giant, called off planned expansions in North Carolina. The moves would have brought a combined 650 jobs to North Carolina and been worth millions of dollars to the state, officials said.", "qid": 870, "docid": "aba3bde71773c21f7293483540241206", "score": 10.734199523925781}, {"content": "Title: Trump signals intent to keep hard-line promises with choices for senior national security posts Content: President-elect Donald Trump on Friday signaled his intention to deliver on his hard-line campaign promises on immigration policy, voting rights, policing and domestic surveillance of Muslims and others suspected of terrorist ties by tapping a trio of staunch conservatives for senior national security roles in his administration. Trump announced that he plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) as attorney general and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) as CIA director, while also choosing retired lieutenant general Michael T. Flynn as his White House national security adviser. Trump\u2019s selections were greeted with widespread applause by his core supporters and other Republicans. But Democrats and civil rights advocates denounced Sessions and Flynn for their controversial records, portending a potentially messy Senate confirmation process for Sessions, a 20-year veteran of the chamber. The announcements came as Trump is weighing his choices for two of the Cabinet\u2019s highest- \u00adprofile posts: secretary of state and secretary of defense. He retreated Friday afternoon to his golf club at Bedminster, N.J., where he intends to spend the weekend with working sessions with his staff and visitors, including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Sessions, 69, was Trump\u2019s first endorser in the Senate and quickly became an influential policy adviser to the GOP nominee. He consistently defended Trump, including after an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video showed Trump bragging about grabbing women by their genitals. Sessions argued that Trump\u2019s comments did not describe sexual assault. Sessions has been dogged by accusations of racism throughout his career. In 1986, he was denied a federal judgeship after former colleagues testified before a Senate committee that he joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying he thought they were \u201cokay, until he learned that they smoked marijuana.\u201d The NAACP wrote in a Twitter message that Sessions\u2019s nomination is \u201cdeeply troubling, and supports an old, ugly history where Civil Rights were not regarded as core American values.\u201d Rep. Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.) said in a statement, \u201cIf you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man.\u201d Senate Republican leaders rallied to Sessions\u2019s defense and said they intended to approve his nomination to lead the Justice Department and serve as the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer. In a statement, Trump heaped praise on his nominee, celebrating Sessions\u2019s \u201cworld-class legal mind\u201d and noting his tenure in Alabama as U.S. attorney and state attorney general. \u201cJeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him,\u201d Trump said. Sessions said in a statement that there was \u201cno greater honor\u201d than to lead the Justice Department. \u201cI enthusiastically embrace President-elect Trump\u2019s vision for \u2018one America,\u2019 and his commitment to equal justice under law,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI look forward to fulfilling my duties with an unwavering dedication to fairness and impartiality.\u201d Because of Senate filibuster rule changes, Democrats\u2019 options to derail Sessions\u2019s nomination are limited. To be confirmed, Sessions would need a simple majority in the Republican-controlled chamber. Unlike Sessions and Pompeo, Flynn is appointed and does not require Senate confirmation. Still, Trump\u2019s pick of the three-star general and decorated intelligence officer has ignited controversy. Flynn has made inflammatory and derogatory comments about Muslims, and he traveled to Moscow last year to dine alongside Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a gala celebrating RT, the state-run propaganda television network. Flynn also supported Trump\u2019s call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States. The president elect is also scheduled to meet Saturday with Romney, who was a fierce critic of Trump\u2019s candidacy but who is being discussed as a potential candidate for secretary of state. Other scheduled visitors on Saturday include former D.C. public schools chancellor Michelle Rhee, Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts, retired Marine general James Mattis, who is seen as a plausible defense secretary, and Robert L. Woodson Sr., who heads the Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington. Woodson, who advises House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on poverty issues, said he is being considered for secretary of housing and urban development. If selected, Woodson, who is black, would add diversity to Trump\u2019s team. Meanwhile, Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, is the leading candidate as Trump\u2019s pick for Director of National Intelligence, according to a person familiar with the matter. The DNI oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies. Rogers took up the helm of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command in April 2014 in the wake of disclosures of widespread NSA collection activities that rocked public confidence in the agency. His term was set to expire in the spring, and his future was uncertain. He has had a rocky relationship with Defense Secretary Ash Carter. Rogers\u2019s consideration was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is chairing Trump\u2019s transition, put a positive spin on Trump\u2019s announced appointments and future selections during a brief visit with reporters Friday at Trump Tower in New York. \u201cThe president-elect is a man of action, and we\u2019ve got a great number of men and women with great qualifications who look forward to serving in this administration,\u201d Pence said. \u201cOur agency teams arrived in Washington, D.C., this morning, and I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward.\u201d Trump characterized Flynn, who was one of his most trusted campaign advisers and frequently traveled with him and spoke at rallies, as \u201cone of the country\u2019s foremost experts on military and intelligence matters.\u201d \u201cI am pleased that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn will be by my side as we work to defeat radical Islamic terrorism, navigate geopolitical challenges and keep Americans safe at home and abroad,\u201d Trump said. After meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday evening, Trump continued his outreach to world leaders on Friday by speaking by phone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. During the campaign, Trump had said he might reconsider the United States\u2019 commitment to the alliance. But he and Stoltenberg \u201cunderlined NATO\u2019s enduring importance\u201d during Friday\u2019s call, according to a statement from a NATO spokeswoman. Stoltenberg invited Trump to Brussels for the NATO summit next year. As they have all week, potential administration appointees cycled through Trump Tower on Friday for face-to-face meetings with the president-elect, including Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a potential defense secretary candidate, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee (R), who is under consideration to be U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee swatted away questions from reporters about whether he was seeking a position. \u201cMy job right now is to listen to the president-elect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s his job to make the decisions. . . . The only person giving out jobs in this building is President-elect Donald Trump, not me.\u201d Meantime, the Trump transition named agency landing teams for the departments of Defense, State and Justice, along with the National Security Council, to help smooth the transfer of power in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s inauguration Jan. 20. Teams will begin work in other agencies and departments next week. Trump\u2019s selection of Pompeo to lead the CIA did not spark as much controversy as his choices of Sessions and Flynn. Pompeo, 52, was elected to the House in 2010 as part of the first wave of tea party lawmakers. A U.S. Military Academy and Harvard Law School graduate, he served as an Army cavalry officer before founding an aerospace company and running an oil-field equipment manufacturing firm. He also has worked as an attorney with the Washington mega-firm Williams and Connolly. Pompeo serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and is a close ally of Pence. He backed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) over Trump in the Republican primaries but supported Trump in the general election. A vocal critic of Obama\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran, Pompeo gained prominence through his role in the congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and assailed former secretary of state Hillary Clinton during the committee\u2019s hearings. Trump said of Pompeo: \u201cHe has served our country with honor and spent his life fighting for the security of our citizens. . . . He will be a brilliant and unrelenting leader for our intelligence community to ensure the safety of Americans and our allies.\u201d Senate Democrats have pledged a rigorous confirmation review for all of Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014 especially Sessions. \u201cI know Senator Sessions and we work out in the gym, but the fact that he is a senator does not absolve him from answering tough questions in the confirmation process,\u201d incoming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cGiven some of his past statements and his staunch opposition to immigration reform, I am very concerned about what he would do with the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and want to hear what he has to say.\u201d But some conservatives suggested it would be politically damaging to Democrats if they attempt to block Trump\u2019s nominees, pointing to the fact that a handful of Senate Democrats face reelection in 2018 in states that Trump carried easily. \u201cMr. Trump has a plane and double-digit victories where Senate Democrats are up for reelection,\u201d said Leonard A.

Trump has mocked McConnell and his lieutenants on social media for abandoning the health-care effort.

They want voters to know the party would do more than just investigate Trump and focus on scandals. That focus has left a void in their messaging regarding the Russia investigation. It sometimes leads to a cacophony of voices and ideas shouted into the winds of the Internet every time there\u2019s a new revelation about Trump\u2019s campaign and ties to Russia.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in an interview before Congress left earlier this month for the August recess. \u201cThis is a national emergency, and we\u2019re going to have to lay down our arms on some of these public-policy issues long enough to reassert that there are, in fact, three separate, coequal branches of government and we are a country of laws and not men.\u201d But others suggest that investigations by Mueller and the House and Senate intelligence committees are well underway and that Democrats need patience. \u201cWe\u2019re seriously into it, and I have to say that the Republicans, they\u2019re not obstructing anymore. They are all moving forward and they all understand how serious this is,\u201d said Sen. Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and serves on the intelligence panel. This Democratic dilemma was captured the night that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) posted an excerpt from his new book, \u201cConscience of a Conservative,\u201d criticizing congressional Republican leaders for not forcefully confronting Trump during the 2016 campaign. Three top Democratic strategists reacted completely differently to the Arizona Republican\u2019s criticism of his own party. \u201cBrave and well argued. I hope both sides have his back,\u201d Robby Mook, the 2016 campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned with his actual voting record. Writing a column is a lot easier than voting against TrumpCare,\u201d Guy Cecil, head of the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA, tweeted. Brian Fallon, a top press aide in the Clinton campaign, called the Flake book the equivalent of \u201cjust a bunch\u201d of tweets \u201c[u]ntil it is matched by any real action.\u201d For now, there has been little to no effort by Democrats to define \u201cany real action.\u201d Do they expect Republicans to vote against Trump\u2019s policy positions because of the shadow of the Russia investigation? Do they want to push for impeachment proceedings? Do they want Republicans to join Flake in a chorus of Trump criticism? Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wants Republicans to start backing up their critiques of Trump with legislative action. After Trump tried to implement an entry ban affecting several majority-Muslim nations, Murphy introduced legislation to block the executive order and hoped for bipartisan support, given how many Republicans criticized Trump\u2019s call for such a ban during the presidential campaign. \u201cI heard a lot of Republicans vigorously complain about the Muslim ban, but none of them were willing to move legislation to stop it,\u201d Murphy said. He applauded Republicans for joining Democrats in approving new sanctions against Russia, overwhelmingly passing legislation that also tied Trump\u2019s hands if he tried to waive those penalties. A good first step for Democrats might be pressuring more Republicans to support proposed legislation that would restrict a president\u2019s ability to fire a special counsel, considering two high-profile Republicans are already supporting such an effort. Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) have each joined Democrats to offer bills that would require a panel of judges to sign off on the firing of Mueller or any special counsel. This would limit the president\u2019s and the attorney general\u2019s ability to shut down the investigation. Given Senate Republicans\u2019 current feelings toward Trump, Democrats might be able to get many Republicans to sign on to one or both bills, sending a warning shot at the president. Schatz said those are the sort of actions that he is looking for in Republicans, hoping that more of them would publicly declare that \u201cone of the bright lines\u201d that Trump cannot cross would be firing Sessions or Mueller. Schatz, firmly in his caucus\u2019s liberal wing, dismissed his allies who are critical of Republicans for continuing to vote in a conservative direction. He does not expect Republicans to start opposing conservative legislation or nominees such as Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch just because Trump is president. \u201cThat\u2019s a misunderstanding of who Jeff Flake is; he\u2019s a conservative,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cWe can\u2019t expect them to become Democrats, but we want them to be small-R republicans, and we need them to help the president understand what the boundaries are in a republic.\u201d _Read more fromPaul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ ****", "qid": 870, "docid": "12b1ab92-7ed2-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e", "score": 10.6850004196167}, {"content": "Title: Trump\u2019s bizarre communications strategy: Constantly upstaging his own agenda Content: The first rule of presidential news management is: Don\u2019t get in the way of your own good news. President Trump has ignored the first rule over and over again. On Wednesday, the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president had some great news to share about jobs and the American economy. He announced that Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics company, has agreed to invest up to $10 billion in a new factory in Wisconsin, an initiative that could create as many as 13,000 new jobs. The deal could spur other investment and even affect the 2018 elections. Missed that story? If so, it probably was because Trump created a bigger story earlier in the day. His surprise announcement via Twitter that he was banning transgender people from military service caught almost everyone by surprise, and resulted in an uproar that dominated the news agenda on TV and everywhere else throughout the day. It was more than enough to make everyone forget, or not know in the first place, that the White House had proclaimed this to be \u201cAmerican Heroes Week,\u201d in honor of military personnel and first responders. Trump has a practically unerring ability to get in the way of news that might be favorable to him and his agenda. On the same day the House passed a bill targeting the federal funding of \u201csanctuary\u201d cities and voted in favor of \u201cKate\u2019s Law\u201d to stiffen penalties for unauthorized immigrants, for example, Trump yanked media attention from those two initiatives by tweeting about cable-news personality Mika Brzezinski\u2019s \u201cface-lift\u201d. A White House-sponsored \u201cinfrastructure\u201d theme week and summit in June was quickly pushed aside by Trump\u2019s defiant tweet in response to congressional testimony by his fired FBI director, James B. Comey. \u201cDespite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication . . . and WOW, Comey is a leaker!\u201d he wrote. Trump also clouded his \u201cinfrastructure\u201d message by tweeting criticism of London mayor Saiq Khan following a terrorist attack on the city. Officially, the White House says this is all just part of the daily agenda. Asked at the daily press briefing on Thursday if such self-created controversies were \u201ca distraction\u201d from the president\u2019s agenda, incoming press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders replied: \u201cI think the president is aware that he can walk and chew gum at the same time. This White House takes on a lot of different things, not one.\u201d Nevertheless, this is different, to say the least. Previous presidents and White Houses have stressed \u201cmessage discipline,\u201d the notion of sticking to a few daily themes and talking points about a policy or event. Message discipline supposedly reinforces a message through repetition, and by shutting out irrelevant, extraneous or competing messages. \u201cI think that he is completely lacking in discipline, and so is his team,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for President Obama. \u201cHe his own worst enemy in stepping on the news cycle. . . . If want to drive a message, you need to be disciplined. You need to stay focused and not comment on the rest of the world.\u201d But as long noted, Trump is adept creating his own weapons of mass distraction. It\u2019s been part of his communications strategy since he was a rising developer in New York City. The basic principle: When the news isn\u2019t going your way, change the subject. As questions mounted about his post-election appointments, his business conflicts and his settling of the Trump University fraud case in late November, for example, Trump demanded that the cast of the Broadway show \u201cHamilton\u201d apologize for reading a post-performance speech in the presence of Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect. The tweet generated a day\u2019s worth of headlines and discussions, sweeping aside much of the hubbub about other, more unpleasant topics. Trump\u2019s tweeting of his transgender-military policy was in the same vein, said Larry Parnell, a veteran public-relations practitioner and associate professor at George Washington University in Washington. The transgender policy tweet is \u201cill-timed, it\u2019s not thought out, it\u2019s impulsive, but it serves to create attention to something other than the things that Trump doesn\u2019t want talk about,\u201d namely the investigations into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and his conflict with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Parnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s news management by distraction, in my view.\u201d Trump probably calculated that the Foxconn announcement would be an important story \u2014 it made the front page of many newspapers, including The Washington Post \u2014 but not sufficiently important to obliterate another day of Russia and Sessions, he said. The tweets about the transgender policy took care of that. Besides, the relatively diminished coverage of the Foxconn news gives Trump a marker for future media criticism. \u201cHe can come back and say this company made a $10 billion investment in the U.S. and the press hardly covered it,\u201d said Parnell. The White House has dubbed next week \u201cAmerican Dream Week,\u201d although it hasn\u2019t specified what policies it will be promoting under that banner. But if history is any guide, you probably won\u2019t hear much about it; the president will be making other, bigger news.", "qid": 870, "docid": "29546ed0-72e2-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304", "score": 10.683799743652344}, {"content": "Title: The White House\u2019s thoughtless, cruel and sad rollback of transgender rights Content: _Arne Duncan was U.S. education secretary from 2009 to 2015. Catherine Lhamon, assistant education secretary for civil rights from 2013 until January, is chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights._ This week\u2019s decision by the Trump administration to withdraw guidance to school communities about how to protect transgender students reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal role in protecting the civil rights of students. Worse yet, it confuses states and school districts, and puts real, live children at greater risk of harm. In the 1972 law commonly known as Title IX, Congress said that educational institutions that receive federal funds may not discriminate on the basis of sex, and authorized the Justice and Education departments to enforce those rights. It is categorically false for the Trump administration to say that guidance developed by the Obama administration was devised without \u201cdue regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing education policy.\u201d Before the guidance was issued in May of last year, we listened to transgender and non-transgender students. We listened to educators, parents, advocacy groups, school boards and administrators. We researched the law and the state of medical guidance. We reviewed the many, varied ways that school districts and colleges and universities address issues affecting transgender students. We heard from moms such as Katharine Prescott in San Diego about the pain of losing her transgender son to suicide after he was bullied in school. We heard from transgender students about the pain of not being called by their names, and of having to answer intrusive questions at school about their anatomies. We heard questions about safety in locker rooms and participation on sports teams. We heard from administrators about the difficult choices they had to make about when to recognize a student in transition and how to protect all students\u2019 privacy. We heard from school districts and boards about how to advise their members and the various choices they face. Having listened, the departments shared guidance about how to satisfy the federal nondiscrimination mandate. Students, and their teachers, deserve no less. They face daily choices \u2014 which bathroom line to stand in, what name or pronoun to use, whether to share information with a class, among so many more. They need answers, right now, so students \u2014 all students \u2014 can enjoy their right to nondiscrimination. Students required to attend school every day need to know that they are safe, welcome and respected as learners. Educators and administrators need concrete information about how to safeguard their federal civil rights. Withdrawing guidance, offering no information instead, and noting that the federal government wants to \u201cmore completely consider the legal issues\u201d is a dangerous default to \u201clocal control\u201d politics instead of honoring the letter and the spirit of the law. Leaving these questions to states means some students in some schools will have less protection than students in other schools. What will happen when a transgender student transfers? This decision is thoughtless, cruel and sad and was implemented without serious consideration for the students it affects. While some states and districts will independently choose to protect transgender rights, Congress was crystal clear that this was a federal responsibility when it enacted Title IX 45 years ago. The law says that \u201cno person\u201d shall be subjected to sex discrimination at school. Unless the Trump administration is arguing that transgender students are not people, it must extend these basic protections to all students. News reports suggest that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos initially refused to join Attorney General Jeff Sessions in withdrawing the guidance but ultimately backed down when faced with the alternative of resignation. If that is true, we give her some credit for trying, but this offers no comfort to a nation increasingly divided by background, race and income. If DeVos can\u2019t win on this issue, what would happen if the law-abiding children of undocumented parents, kids who have spent most of their lives in the United States, were deported like common criminals? Would she win if federal education funds targeted to low-income children were instead spent on higher-income children? Would she win if students with disabilities were illegally denied the educational supports they need and deserve? Would she win if students of color continued to be suspended and expelled far out of proportion to their numbers? Would she block schools from discriminating in other nefarious ways? On issues such as standards and curriculum, the federal government rightly defers to states and districts, but when it comes to protecting students, the law is clear: Civil rights are paramount. These are real issues affecting real people and carrying consequences every day for children in classrooms. They deserve better. **Read more:** The Post\u2019s View: The White House just told transgender students they\u2019re on their own Katelyn Burns: Transgender kids are bullied all the time.

Baker, the late Republican senator from Tennessee and GOP Senate leader in the 1970s and 1980s, became a profile in courage when he put country above party during the Watergate investigation, famously asking,\u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d McConnell, who now occupies the high office Baker once held, had a chance Wednesday for his Baker moment. The night before, President Trump had fired FBI Director James Comey, the man overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the election with potential Trump campaign collusion. Even many Republicans were aghast at the clumsy, Nixonian move that was plainly aimed at shutting down the probe. Forty-five of 48 Democrats were at their desks Wednesday morning on the Senate floor, which was gravely silent \u2014 a measure of the gravity of the moment. Several Republicans were there, too. McConnell rose \u2014 and spoke about \u201cHonor Flights\u201d for veterans. He then furnished more complaints about Obamacare. Then, by way of afterthought, he added a few words on the stunning events of Tuesday night. \u201cWhat we have now,\u201d he argued, is \u201cour Democratic colleagues complaining about the removal of an FBI director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized.\u201d McConnell went on to argue that a new investigation \u201ccould only serve to impede the current work being done\u201d to investigate the Russian interference. Right. So calls for a more vigorous investigation would . . . impede the investigation. And people who previously criticized Comey can\u2019t complain about the extremely suspicious manner in which he was fired. By that logic, those who criticized Abraham Lincoln\u2019s military strategy were hypocritical to condemn John Wilkes Booth for shooting him. McConnell\u2019s small-mindedness would be funny if the situation weren\u2019t so grave. This is a serious threat, not to Republicans but to America. A leading adversary successfully intervened in a presidential election \u2014 possibly with the collusion of the victor. And the man leading the investigation, who just last week asked for more resources for the probe, was instead fired by the man he asked (new deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein), quite likely on the president\u2019s instructions. There have been reports that grand-jury subpoenas were ready to fly, and public testimony raised new suspicions of collusion. We also know that Trump refused to take action when told his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was compromised with the Russians \u2014 until the matter blew up publicly. We also know that the firing (and now replacement) of the FBI director is under the auspices of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is supposed to be recused from the Russia probe because of his own Russia contacts. And look at the man McConnell is protecting. Russophile Trump surrounded himself on the campaign with men tied to Russia: Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, Flynn. And on Wednesday morning, the day after firing Comey, Trump gave a new display of his Russia-friendly ways. He sat down in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and banned the U.S. media from the session; the only \u201cmedia\u201d present, apparently, was Tass, the Russian state-owned news agency, which published photos of the meeting. The White House issued a \u201creadout\u201d from the session saying Trump expressed his \u201cdesire to build a better relationship between the United States and Russia.\u201d By killing the probe into its help getting him elected? During Watergate, there were many Republicans who bravely stood up to Nixon. Rep. Lawrence Hogan of Maryland, father of the current governor, Rep. M. Caldwell Butler of Virginia, Attorney General Elliot Richardson, Sens. Hugh Scott (Pa.) and Barry Goldwater (Ariz.) and others earned places of honor in history for that. There are some who have the potential to play that role now. Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said the timing and reasoning of the firing don\u2019t make sense, and he invited Comey to testify. Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) has called for a select committee to investigate and Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.) for an independent commission. Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Bob Corker (Tenn.) and James Lankford (Okla.), and a couple of others, have raised questions. Will they, like their predecessors 40-odd years ago, be able to recognize that Trump\u2019s action Tuesday night and McConnell\u2019s mindless defense of it are more a danger to country than to party? As Democrats thundered about the need for a special prosecutor, Republicans quietly expressed unease and White House officials fabricated facts to justify Trump\u2019s actions, the president took to Twitter. \u201cWhen things calm down,\u201d he wrote, everybody \u201cwill be thanking me.\u201d Sergei Lavrov and the Russians may thank Trump.

Mykel, Shannen, Buttacup, Esha. For years, this spot at North Charles and 22nd streets, near the main train station, has been the hub of Baltimore\u2019s transgender prostitution scene, a nightly choreography of cliches \u2014 heels too high, shorts too short, shirts too tight, wigs too big, makeup too heavy. Now, one of their friends is gone, and another is injured. Mya, on the streets since 2009, was killed and a newcomer, Brittany, was injured when officers opened fire Monday after the pair allegedly crashed into a guard post at the National Security Agency, 28 miles away. In the early moments, the incident had the Washington region on alert, with fears that it could be terrorism or another type of planned attack. But in the end, authorities said the pair were in an SUV stolen from a man who had picked them up the night before. They mistakenly took a restricted exit and panicked when they saw police. Officials identified them by their legal names: Ricky Hall, 27, who went by Mya, and Kevin Fleming, 20, or Brittany. When police initially noted that the two were dressed in women\u2019s clothing, it seemed a strange twist. Later, authorities made a point to say that the garb had not been meant as a disguise. Now, their friends in Baltimore\u2019s historic Old Goucher neighborhood, many with questions about the encounter with law enforcement, are in mourning. Death, they say, comes too often, too young and too easy to a transgender population marginalized by a society that they say forces some to resort to prostitution, or what they call becoming \u201csurvivor sex workers.\u201d \u201cThey are being driven to their deaths,\u201d Bryanna A. Jenkins, 26, who runs a transgender advocacy group, said while on a tour of the neighborhood. \u201cOut here, you can be attacked. You can be raped. You can be arrested for being trans.\u201d Several transgender prostitutes interviewed as they worked Charles Street early Friday described Hall as a sweet jokester who let others stay in her motel room when she had one, enjoyed dressing in skirts and kidded her friends. \u201cA lot of people envied her,\u201d said Mykel Caldwell, 21. But a woman calling herself Buttacup, who is 26 and moved to Baltimore from Fairfax County, said that Hall hit the streets in 2009 and soon became hardened \u2014 \u201cdrugs, bad men, bad decisions.\u201d Buttacup reflected a fatalism that mirrored others who were interviewed, saying: \u201cMya didn\u2019t want to change. She thought she was perfect, and she died.\u201d Authorities had earlier theorized that Hall and Fleming were trying to evade capture because there were drugs in the Ford Escape, which authorities said they stole from the 60-year-old who had taken them to a pay-by-the-hour motel south of the city, in Elkridge, Md. But Maryland court records show that Hall also was facing new limits on her freedom and potentially several years of prison. She had violated terms of her probation four times since an assault conviction in 2012 \u2014 piling up a steady stream of arrests and convictions for punching a woman and stealing her methadone in Old Goucher, shoplifting skirts from stores in the Hampden neighborhood, hitting a jail guard with a stick and soliciting a male undercover police officer for a $40 sex act on Charles Street. Hall had recently been placed in Maryland\u2019s Violence Prevention Initiative, the state\u2019s strictest probation monitoring. She failed to pick up a court-ordered electronic monitoring bracelet that would have required her to live in a transitional housing facility that helps people recover from drug abuse and other problems. A spokesman for the state prison system said officials had requested an arrest warrant for Hall hours before she was killed. Many details of Hall\u2019s background were unclear. Court records show she grew up in Owings Mills, a suburb northwest of Baltimore, and once worked delivering pizzas. Her 78-year-old grandmother is listed as a contact on many official forms; when reached at her two-story brick rowhouse in Northeast Baltimore, she declined to comment. It was not clear whether Hall has other close relatives. A mug shot from Baltimore police shows Hall with groomed eyebrows and heart-shaped tattoos trailing under the right eye, and wearing a disheveled wig. According to court records, Hall lived in a variety of places in Old Goucher, including what is now a vacant rowhouse and a group home for homeless teenagers. The community, roughly 40 square blocks, boasts 1800s Victorian rowhouses and was home to three Baltimore mayors during the 19th century. Plans are in the works to plant 300 trees. Kelly Cross, 36, the head of the community association, said he wants to build on an adjacent arts district that is trying to remake a dangerous corridor by getting Harvard students to set up studios and bring in a private collection of contemporary art. Cross said transgender prostitution has abated in recent years but remains a stubborn problem. Prostitution, he said, used to be the focus of every community meeting. \u201cI decided that my focus would be on trying to change the condition of the neighborhood,\u201d he said, \u201cas opposed to chasing people around from one block to another.\u201d He said the prostitutes \u201care a symptom of a weak neighborhood, a lack of businesses, a lack of economic vitality.\u201d The neighborhood has two methadone clinics, a center for battered children, housing for the homeless. On Thursday, the shelter where Hall once lived had a sign on the front door promoting a job fair: \u201cConvicted felons welcome.\u201d Cross said the services moved in because of the need, but he also said they have a negative impact in that \u201cthey feed off each other. . . . Before you know it, you have this ecosystem of people struggling.\u201d Jenkins, the transgender advocate, said she met Hall briefly about two years ago when she worked with a group passing out condoms and trying to help the prostitutes with housing and legal matters. \u201cMya had a hard life,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cShe just wanted to have a job, a life, a home. Just the simple things.\u201d The hospital where authorities said that Fleming was being treated deny having anyone there by that name, and the FBI did not make the name public and will not discuss a medical condition. Two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation identified Fleming as the injured person. Fleming\u2019s family could not be reached. Amy J. Thoreson, spokeswoman for the Baltimore field office of the FBI, said Friday that no charges had been filed against the second person in the car. On the street early Friday, the women hustled for tricks as cars slowed for drivers to survey the scene. Shannen, one of the women working Charles Street, declined to share her last name. \u201cNone of us want to live like this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we learn lessons in life, and we die.\u201d The women were just as interested in posing questions as answering them. Who claimed Hall\u2019s body? What did her parents say? How many times was she shot? Why did the police have to shoot her? Most of all, they felt isolated from the normal ritual of grief as they mourned together on Charles Street.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the Obama administration had been reviewing the bill \u201cfor several weeks.\u201d \u201cUpon that review it is now clear that the administration strongly supports the Equality Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThat bill is historic legislation that would advance the cause of equality for millions of Americans. \u201cWe look forward to working with Congress to ensure that the legislative process produces a result that balances both the bedrock principles of civil rights . . . with the religious liberty that we hold dear in this country,\u201d Earnest added. Although there is little chance that this Congress will approve the legislation \u2014 which was introduced in July by Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), and Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) \u2014 President Obama\u2019s support elevates the question of whether lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans need greater legal safeguards. Last week, Houston voters rejected an ordinance that would have barred discrimination against gay and transgender people after opponents said it would allow men disguised as women to enter women\u2019s restrooms. The White House\u2019s endorsement of the Equality Act came on the same day that Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to be featured on the cover of an LGBT publication, after he was named Out magazine\u2019s \u201cAlly of the Year\u201d for 2015. In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to legalize same-sex marriage, activists have been pressing for expanded protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity beyond employment discrimination, which had been the focus of past legislation. A bill that would have banned workplace discrimination passed the Senate with bipartisan support in 2013 but did not advance in the House. With Republicans now in control of both chambers of Congress, there is little chance that the Equality Act, which has the support of 37 Democrats and two independents in the Senate and 170 Democrats in the House, will become law before Obama leaves office. Still, the decision by the nation\u2019s first African American president to back the measure is significant. Some leading civil rights groups \u2014 including the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights \u2014 have been slow to endorse the legislation. Although those groups support the idea of a broad LGBT anti-discrimination bill, they have been skeptical about reopening the landmark 1964 law for revisions. Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said in an interview that the civil rights community has \u201csupported the concept of the Equality Act from its very inception.\u201d \u201cIt recognizes, however, there are questions that could benefit from further analysis,\u201d he added. \u201cBefore it moves forward, there\u2019s hope that those can be addressed.\u201d A majority of Americans, including Republicans, say in public surveys that they back civil rights safeguards based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Over the past six months, for example, the Public Religion Research Institute has found overall support at 68 percent or higher. After Earnest\u2019s announcement Tuesday, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement that \u201cthe White House sent a strong message that it\u2019s time to put the politics of discrimination behind us once and for all.\u201d \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that, while LGBT Americans can legally get married, millions remain at risk of being fired or denied services for who they are or who they love because the majority of states still lack explicit, comprehensive non-discrimination protections,\u201d Griffin added. Conservatives argue that the Equality Act would infringe on those Americans who object to homosexuality and being transgender on religious grounds. In July, the conservative Witherspoon Institute published an essay by Andrew T. Walker saying that, if enacted, the bill would \u201cfurther erode religious liberty, transform public opinion on sexuality, and harm the public perception of those who believe in traditional or biblical sexual morality.\u201d The White House announcement comes after media coverage of celebrities such as Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox, as well as a series of lawsuits, has increased the profile of transgender people. Jenner accepted a \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d award from Glamour magazine Monday night; Cox was one of the recipients last year. On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Iowa and lawyers at the Des Moines firm Babich Goldman filed a complaint with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission against Drury Inn for discriminating against a black transgender woman in July. Meagan Taylor and a friend, who also is black and transgender, checked into the hotel in West Des Moines on their way to a funeral and were interrogated by the staff there, according to the complaint. At some point between check-in and the next morning, the ACLU statement says, Drury Inn staff members called the police to report that they suspected Taylor and her friend were prostitutes because they were \u201cmen dressed like women,\u201d and Taylor was arrested and held in solitary confinement. Local police charged Taylor with possessing hormone pills without a copy of the prescription, but those charges were later dropped. \u201cThis ordeal was humiliating, scary and traumatizing,\u201d Taylor said in the complaint. \u201cI realized I was not welcome in a public place simply because of who I am.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "3a05107e-87c8-11e5-9a07-453018f9a0ec", "score": 10.603500366210938}, {"content": "Title: Five myths about Sen. Jeff Sessions Content: __ Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) has been the subject of intense debate ever since Donald Trump nominated him to be attorney general. His critics argue that he could lead a radical rollback of civil rights policies, while supporters defend his record as more moderate. Sorting the truth about Sessions from the hyperbole isn\u2019t easy. Sessions has been called a \u201cthreat to civil rights\u201d and \u201cunfit \u201d for his post, largely because of what critics see as his \u201calarming history of opposing civil rights\u201d and support of policies that reinforce discrimination and produce \u201cracist outcomes.\u201d In reality, he isn\u2019t an outlier among Senate Republicans. Yes, Sessions\u2019s voting record shows that he is a consistent opponent of expansive civil rights legislation. So are many of his colleagues. During the 114th Congress in 2015 and 2016, for instance, the advocacy group Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights tracked 21 key Senate votes; Sessions opposed the group\u2019s position every time, and he did the same in the previous Congress. However, this is not unusual within the Republican Party. In the 114th Congress, Sessions was one of 16 senators, all Republicans, to receive a score of zero, and one of 18 GOP senators in the 113th Congress. And Sessions is no less popular among African American voters than most other Republican lawmakers are. According to the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study conducted by researchers at Harvard University, the average approval rating for Republican senators among their African American constituents was 27 percent. Sessions\u2019s approval rating was 25 percent, the same as for Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.). That\u2019s certainly low, but it doesn\u2019t make Sessions an outlier. The Trump transition team and its allies have tried to argue, on the other hand, that Sessions is a civil rights champion, citing several cases he handled as a U.S. attorney and as Alabama\u2019s attorney general. As a New York Post editorial put it, \u201cSessions desegregated schools and successfully prosecuted the head of the state Ku Klux Klan for murder \u2014 then, as the state\u2019s attorney general, saw the killer executed.\u201d On his radio show, Sean Hannity even went so far as to proclaim that Sessions\u2019s civil rights record is \u201csecond to none .\u201d These claims are exaggerated. Sessions was involved as a U.S. attorney in the investigation of Henry Hays, a Klan member suspected of lynching Michael Donald in Mobile, Ala., in 1981. But as the Atlantic noted, the principal players in the case say that Sessions merely played a \u201csupervisory role.\u201d The case was not prosecuted by Sessions; it was prosecuted in state court, which is where Hays received the death penalty. Sessions had become Alabama\u2019s attorney general by the time Hays appealed his sentence. He opposed the appeal, and Hays was executed in 1997. Perhaps the most significant exaggeration involves Sessions\u2019s role in desegregating Alabama\u2019s schools. There is no record that he ever filed such a case, and he certainly did not participate in \u201c20 to 30\u201d such cases, as he once claimed in 2009. Sessions was involved in a handful of voting rights cases while he was a U.S. attorney. But his role was relatively minor. Much of the opposition to Sessions\u2019s nomination revolves around his record on immigration policy. Reports have predicted that he would lead a crackdown on illegal immigration, perhaps involving mass deportations . Sessions has a long record as a crusader against both legal and illegal immigration, constantly pushing Congress to pursue harsher border security and immigration measures. If he is confirmed, though, his ability to do what his critics fear will be constrained by the federal bureaucracy, local law enforcement officials and even Republicans in Congress. Most federal immigration enforcement falls to another Cabinet agency, the Department of Homeland Security, which contains both U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The attorney general does have important relevant powers: The immigration court system is part of the Justice Department, for example, and Sessions would be able to appoint immigration law judges. In recent years, though, only 25 percent of deportations have been processed through immigration courts. The vast majority have come via DHS and don\u2019t require a court appearance. Only about half of the cases that do go through immigration courts result in a removal. Meanwhile, \u201csanctuary cities\u201d around the country, which don\u2019t enforce federal immigration laws, have promised to resist any attempted crackdown, even if Sessions threatened to cut federal grants to their police departments. It may be impossible to increase deportations dramatically, anyway, no matter what Sessions might prefer. The Obama administration already deported a record number of people, earning President Barack Obama the sardonic title of \u201cdeporter in chief\u201d among immigration advocates. The undocumented population has decreased. And House Speaker Paul Ryan indicated recently that Congress won\u2019t go along with mass deportations of undocumented immigrants who don\u2019t have criminal records. \u201cThe war on drugs is coming back\u201d under Sessions, Slate predicted in November. Similar warnings have appeared in Politico and Newsweek . As a U.S. attorney, Sessions had a reputation for aggressive prosecution of drug offenses. And in the Senate, he has pushed for tougher enforcement of drug laws. Federal drug enforcement may become a higher priority under Sessions than it was under Obama\u2019s attorney generals. But bringing back a full-scale war on drugs \u2014 a la Nancy Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign \u2014 isn\u2019t likely. Critics fear that Sessions would go after the marijuana industry in the states that permit medical marijuana (28 states and the District) or recreational uses (eight states and D.C.). Under the Obama administration, the Justice Department chose not to pursue most individual recreational users in states that had legalized marijuana, instead focusing on preventing distribution to minors or across state lines. During his confirmation hearing, Sessions described the current solution for dealing with inconsistency between state and federal laws, crafted by former attorney general Eric Holder, as \u201ctruly valuable.\u201d He added that more comprehensive enforcement of federal marijuana laws in these states is \u201ca problem of resources for the federal government\u201d \u2014 suggesting that it\u2019s not worth the cost. Sessions could influence other federal drug policies: He would have broad discretion to redirect resources and shape prosecution and sentencing practices in ways that could lead to a significant increase in federal prison sentences for drug offenders. But as USA Today points out, Sessions has \u201creversed course on harsh drug sentence policy\u201d in recent years, working with Democrats to co-sponsor legislation to reduce disparities between punishments for crack and powder cocaine, which led to significantly longer sentences for black drug offenders than for white ones. Sessions\u2019s allies say his record doesn\u2019t show any particular antipathy toward lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. He is \u201ca respecter of the law,\u201d a Washington Examiner column argued. A post on the conservative blog Power Line said Sessions shouldn\u2019t be criticized for attempting to block an LGBT conference at the University of Alabama in 1996, because as the state\u2019s attorney general, he was just enforcing a law against using state funds or facilities for activity that promoted \u201cactions prohibited by sodomy and sexual misconduct laws.\u201d The senator\u2019s record of opposing gay rights, however, is clear. Unlike on the question of racial inequality, where there are some examples of Sessions moderating his positions, there is no evidence that he has softened his opposition to rights for gays and lesbians. He has a long history of opposing every important piece of legislation aimed at expanding such rights. He was one of the most vocal opponents of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include attacks on people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBT people are the most likely to be targets of hate crimes, and as attorney general, Sessions would be in charge of enforcing this law. While he told the Senate that he now sees same-sex marriage as settled law that he will uphold, he co-sponsored the State Marriage Defense Act of 2014, which would have allowed a state\u2019s definitions of \u201cspouse\u201d and \u201cmarriage\u201d to supercede the federal definitions. And he is currently a co-sponsor of the First Amendment Defense Act, which groups like the ACLU say would \u201copen the door to unprecedented taxpayer-funded discrimination against LGBT people\u201d by prohibiting the federal government from taking action against groups that refuse to serve gays and lesbians. **Twitter: @rfording** Five myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

Republican leaders insist that a deal can be struck soon to provide the money federal health officials say is needed to develop a vaccine. They also played down the risk of waiting a little longer, arguing existing money is available for the initial steps needed to help contain the virus while lawmakers resolve the larger funding fight. \u201cThey can get to work on this problem, and there\u2019s money in the pipeline that\u2019s already going out the door right now,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Thursday. But with Democrats hammering Republicans over neglect on a virus that attacks pregnant women, some GOP lawmakers, particularly those in Florida and other warm-weather locales, expressed increasing anxiety about the slowly developing response as the warm weather breeds more mosquitoes. \u201cThe CDC is saying we\u2019re less than a month away from a mosquito [epidemic] in the U.S. I mean, I take that seriously,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), the onetime GOP presidential contender, said this week. \u201cThese are not politicians. These are scientists and doctors that are looking at this issue and telling us, you\u2019ve got a real problem on your hands.\u201d For months officials at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention have been monitoring the outbreak of Zika in South America, particularly in Brazil, where hundreds of thousands of visitors will descend in August for the Summer Olympics and then return to their native countries. Last week, U.S. officials announced that they are monitoring hundreds of pregnant women for Zika signs and that there are growing concerns about a large outbreak in Puerto Rico. In response to the Obama administration\u2019s $1.9 billion Zika request, the Senate approved $1.1 billion in funding earlier this month while the House has passed legislation that would provide $622 million, which would be drawn from money already set aside for Ebola programs. In April, the administration redirected an initial flow of more than $500 million from Ebola funds to begin the battle against Zika as it pressed Congress to act quickly on President Obama\u2019s larger funding request. Democrats do not approve of pulling more money from the leftover Ebola account, because the initial plan two years ago called for any remaining funds to be spent helping nations overseas prepare to fight the deadly disease in the future. In public briefings and private meetings with lawmakers health officials have cited evidence linking Zika to a rare condition causing children to be born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. Hundreds of babies in Brazil have suffered this condition, and the outbreak that has spread to three dozen countries, primarily in the Americas. Instead of racing to fund efforts to thwart a potential health crisis, lawmakers are treating the Zika debate like regular legislation, approving Thursday the establishment of a House-Senate committee to hammer out differences in their competing bills. Democrats have criticized the Republicans for weeks on the slow response, culminating with a media showcase Thursday on the House steps demanding that the traditional Memorial Day recess be eliminated so lawmakers could finish the issue next week. \u201cRepublicans are going to do it again: take a week off and not going to worry about those pesky mosquitoes,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said during a floor speech. But an influential bloc of conservatives remain committed to reining in government spending, demanding cuts from other portions of the budget before allowing increased funds to battle Zika. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a fiscal hawk, called it \u201cweak\u201d policy to just push $1 billion more into the effort without any assurance of the outcome, without some corresponding cuts to other federal programs. \u201cThe big disagreement that we have and the difficulty we deal with is,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cshould every time a billion-dollar or $2 billion project comes along, do we just borrow the money?\u201d Some Republicans also harbor such distrust of Obama \u2014 from executive actions on immigration, transgender issues in schools, overtime rules and other issues \u2014 that they are hesitant to release money to his administration. These conservatives have reservations about how the government spent funds two years ago battling the Ebola outbreak, which was largely considered a success because of its very limited impact in the United States. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a leader of the hard-line conservative House Freedom Caucus, called the Ebola response \u201ccertainly a success\u201d but said that much of the roughly $2.7 billion in those funds was not spent in the most \u201cprudent and logical manner.\u201d That has led conservatives to issue many more questions about how administration officials intend to spend any Zika money. \u201cNot having a real plan, where that\u2019s spent and how it\u2019s spent, is troubling and something that has to be addressed,\u201d Meadows said. Others said there is just not the same level of immediacy and understanding of this virus as there was of Ebola, where thousands of Africans were dying within weeks of contracting it, and Zika moves more slowly and federal officials also have yet to formally announce a single domestic case. Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) cited another, more basic rationale for his inability to win over more support from his colleagues: Washington\u2019s unusually cold, wet spring. \u201cThat actually may have played a role in it,\u201d said Rooney, who supports higher funding levels but suggested the weather pushed mosquitoes to the back of lawmakers\u2019 minds. \u201cNow it\u2019s hot here,\u201d Rooney said Wednesday outside the Capitol as the temperature crested 80 degrees, hoping his colleagues would now see the light. Ryan and his closest allies have grown angry at the Democratic allegations that they are neglecting the issue. \u201cTo say that we are not sympathetic, understanding and balanced on the Zika issue would be wrong,\u201d said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.), chairman of the Rules Committee. Still, some Republicans fear the worst outcome, both in terms of public health and what it could mean for them politically. \u201cObviously in South Florida where I\u2019m from the problem is going to intensify,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cHopefully not to the point where it\u2019s some kind of an epidemic that if we don\u2019t get something done we are culpable for not acting on this.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "d04cf1d5207b50f21c282fb327a9ea20", "score": 10.481800079345703}, {"content": "Title: In executive actions, President Trump vows crackdown on violent crime. Is America as unsafe as he thinks? Content: President Trump signed three executive actions Thursday designed to crack down on violence in America, directing the Department of Justice to form a task force and take other steps to target criminal gangs and reduce violent crime and crime against police. Trump has long held a pessimistic view of how safe people are in the U.S., declaring in his inaugural address that the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d would stop with his presidency. As his new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was sworn in Thursday, Trump said he was signing the executive actions to \u201crestore safety in America.\u201d \u201cFirst, I\u2019m directing Department of Justice & Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people, many other people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSecondly, I\u2019m directing Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime in America. And thirdly, I\u2019m directing the Department of Justice to implement a plan to stop crime and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers.\u201d But Trump has, in the past, misstated crime statistics or not presented them in the proper context, presenting a somewhat bleaker view than perhaps is warranted. He has accurately cited a statistic from the Brennan Center for Justice, which found that, in the largest 30 cities, homicides increased by 14 percent from 2015 to 2016. But in that data set, one outlier city \u2014 Chicago \u2014 was responsible for 43.7 percent of the total increase in homicide rates in 2016. Civil liberties groups criticized the executive orders as responses to a non-existent problem. \u201cPresident Trump intends to build task forces to investigate and stop national trends that don\u2019t exist,\u201d said ACLU Deputy Legal Director Jeffery Robinson. \u201cWe have seen historic lows in the country\u2019s crime rate and a downward trend in killings against police officers since the 1980s. The president not only doesn\u2019t acknowledge these facts about our nation\u2019s safety, he persists in ignoring the all-too-real deaths of Black and brown people at the hands of law enforcement.\u201d Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, Co-Director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s U.S. program, said, \u201cThe executive orders President Trump signed today on criminal justice are premised on a distortion of reality that will ultimately be counterproductive. Smart public safety policies should be based on the realities that communities, law enforcement, and victims face, so that resources are used wisely. Far from soaring, overall crime rates have decreased steadily in recent decades, though homicide rates in several major cities have increased and require thoughtful attention.\u201d Sessions said in his own remarks that America had \u201ca crime problem,\u201d and it was no mere anomaly. \u201cI wish the rise that we are seeing in crime in America today were some sort of aberration or a blip,\u201d he said. \u201cMy best judgment, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years, is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk. We will deploy the talents and abilities of the Department of Justice in the most effective way possible to confront this rise in crime and to protect the people of our country.\u201d Sessions mentioned violent crime in his remarks even before terrorism, indicating just how high a priority it might become in his Justice Department. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame what\u2019s been happening to our great, truly great, law enforcement officers,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to stop, as of today.\u201d Trump has cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate since the campaign trail. Some advocates worry that he is not adequately concerned, though, with police abuses and those killed by police. Some cities in recent years, including Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore and Charlotte, have seen protests and violence erupt after incidents of black men being killed at the hands of law enforcement officers. The Justice Department under President Barack Obama sent mediators to those cities to try to keep the peace. The Obama administration also aggressively investigated the police with systemic reviews of entire departments to address the root cause of conflict between law enforcement and residents. Neither Trump nor his attorney general mentioned such investigations at the swearing-in ceremony. On the White House website, the Trump administration has hinted at a crackdown on protests. \u201cOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter,\u201d the site says. Sessions, though, did note another issue of importance to him: immigration. That is significant, as the Justice Department is in the midst of a heated court battle to defend Trump\u2019s now-frozen executive order barring refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \u201cWe need a lawful system of immigration \u2014 one that serves the interests of the people of the United States,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cThat\u2019s not wrong, that\u2019s not immoral, that\u2019s not indecent.

The concerns prompted Democrats on Saturday to call for delaying the confirmation process, but Republicans signaled they are unlikely to budge on the eve of a slew of hearings in the Senate. The Trump administration-in-waiting faces its first big test in coming days, with as many as seven nominees for Cabinet positions \u2014 many of them already the subject of questions about their qualifications \u2014 scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill. The process begins Tuesday, when Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Trump\u2019s controversial nominee for attorney general, is scheduled to begin two days of hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But the big show is planned for Wednesday, when five hearings are scheduled, bringing a marathon of nationally televised scrutiny to the thin public records and vast wealth of many of Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. Democrats have vowed to cast the hearings as a proxy test of Trump himself, in hopes of discrediting his new government before it begins. They hope to remind the public of the president-elect\u2019s own lack of government experience and reluctance to separate himself from an entanglement of global business interests while he leads the nation. But even Democrats acknowledge that Trump\u2019s slate of Cabinet picks will probably sail through. The packed schedule, similar to those for nominees of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was orchestrated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the Trump team. In addition, Trump has scheduled a news conference Wednesday that will overlap with several hearings, at which he has promised to talk about separating his presidency from his business interests. Whether the schedule holds in the coming days is unclear. McConnell\u2019s office declined to respond to warnings by Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, who said in a letter released Friday the current confirmation calendar is \u201cof great concern to me\u201d because nominees have not completed a required ethics review before their hearings. Shaub added: \u201cI am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process.\u201d Republican aides have disputed that notion, saying that in some cases, nominees of both parties have sat for hearings before the paperwork process was completed. But Democrats struck back Saturday, saying that hearings should be delayed until all paperwork is completed. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said consideration of GOP power broker Betsy DeVos to be education secretary should be postponed until OGE finishes reviewing her background and financial investments for possible conflicts of interest or other ethics concerns. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) condemned what he called a lack of cooperation and communication by the Trump transition and asked for a \u201ctimeout\u201d on consideration of nominees until such basic information as an ethics agreement is available to members of the Senate. \u201cWe should put all of these on hold until the background checks by the FBI and the ethics office reports are completed,\u201d he said in an interview Saturday. The OGE enforces federal ethics rules and reviews potential conflicts of interest for nominees to government posts. Shaub, a lawyer and political appointee of President Obama, took over the office in 2013. He donated a total of $500 to Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, federal elections records show. Ethics experts from both political parties expressed dismay at the possibility that confirmation hearings would proceed before the OGE reviews are completed. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Trevor Potter, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who has served as counsel to several Republican presidential candidates and Cabinet nominees in the past. \u201cThis suggests that there has been a real breakdown between the transition and the Office of Government Ethics.\u201d Much of the attention this week is expected to focus on Sessions and his controversial record on civil rights, and on ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of state, who has never served in the public sector. Tillerson is scheduled to appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wednesday. The health and education panel is set to consider DeVos the same day, while the Senate Intelligence Committee has announced plans to review the nomination of Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.), Trump\u2019s nominee for CIA director. Elaine Chao \u2014 a former secretary of labor who is married to McConnell \u2014 is set to appear before the Commerce Committee to discuss her nomination as transportation secretary. On Tuesday, in addition to Sessions, retired Marine general John Kelly is scheduled to testify at a Homeland Security committee hearing to review his nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, the Trump transition team said Saturday that the president-elect \u201cis putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly.\u201d The statement added that \u201cit is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country. This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president.\u201d McConnell had already vowed Wednesday that \u201call the president-elect\u2019s Cabinet appointments will be confirmed.\u201d He called on Democrats to not delay votes on Trump\u2019s less controversial choices for national security posts, including Kelly and retired Marine general James Mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense. \u201cBasically, they can delay the process. They can\u2019t stop it,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said of his Democratic colleagues. Republicans said they are proceeding quickly in the hope of confirming a handful of Trump picks on Inauguration Day, as happened eight years ago, when seven of Obama\u2019s Cabinet nominees were confirmed unanimously on his first day in office. But Democrats said Obama\u2019s nominations moved quickly because nominees had submitted requisite paperwork by early January. On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Shaub\u2019s warning \u201cmakes crystal-clear that the transition team\u2019s collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these Cabinet nominees before they\u2019ve been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented.\u201d Murray said in an interview last week that Trump \u201cran his campaign telling people he was about jobs and workers. Many of these nominees don\u2019t share that view. Our responsibility is to make sure that we know what we are buying and the country knows what they bought.\u201d Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said: \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with more billionaires than we\u2019ve ever seen in one place in this Trump Cabinet. It creates a special challenge.\u201d Democrats said they plan to focus intently on nominees\u2019 business interests and financial disclosures. Several nominees, including DeVos and other picks not yet scheduled for hearings, will probably be grilled over past statements in support of dismantling portions of the departments they have been tapped to lead. Kelly, Pompeo, Sessions and Tillerson are the furthest along in responding to written questionnaires and divulging personal and financial information, according to Senate aides. But reviews by the FBI and OGE are still underway for most nominees, according to the aides, who are tracking the process but not authorized to speak publicly about details. Sessions\u2019s FBI check is complete, but other nominees have yet to complete all of the paperwork required by committees, because the FBI and OGE reviews continue, the aides said. Many of Trump\u2019s picks are widely unknown on Capitol Hill, prompting his transition team to recruit former GOP senators and the party\u2019s top-flight communications and policy talent to make introductions and assuage concerns among Republicans and Democrats alike. Nominees have been scheduled for more than 60 meet-and-greets with senators of both parties, according to Senate aides. Dress rehearsals to prepare for contentious lines of questioning have been underway for several days. Given Trump\u2019s refusal to release tax returns and other financial information during the presidential campaign, Democrats see his Cabinet choices as a way to revive the issue. But if Trump uses his scheduled news conference to divulge details of his finances amid a flurry of confirmation hearings, it may capture the news cycle and neutralize opposition. While each committee has different disclosure rules for Cabinet picks, just three panels \u2014 Budget, Finance, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \u2014 have the authority to require nominees to release three years of tax returns. Republicans have rebuffed Democratic requests to force all Cabinet nominees to do so. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, recalled that his panel\u2019s long-standing tax disclosure rules unearthed trouble for several of Obama\u2019s Cabinet choices, including former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle, who was forced to withdraw his nomination to serve as secretary of health and human services due to questions about unreported earnings and gifts. With Democrats vowing to pepper Tillerson about his tenure as an oil executive, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, said the former chief executive\u2019s decision to completely cut ties with ExxonMobil was \u201cresponsible.\u201d \u201cIt certainly takes away an issue that we knew had to be taken away,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI mean, my very first conversation with him \u2014 he knew that, Exxon knew that.\u201d Corker added that Tillerson will probably have \u201cone of the cleaner [financial] disclosures because his whole life and his whole net worth\u2019s been in one company.\u201d Some Democrats on the judiciary panel say they have no plans to give Sessions an easy pass, despite his status as a well-liked senator and a former U.S. attorney. Several have vowed to rehash his staunch opposition to immigration reform, his recent support for Trump\u2019s call to require \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and his civil rights record. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 over charges of racial insensitivity and prejudice. \u201cA person\u2019s whole lifetime career should be considered in such an important position,\u201d Blumenthal said in an interview last week. \u201cThis position is not just a government lawyer or another Cabinet position. It is the nation\u2019s chief enforcer of the rule of law, which is the bedrock of our democracy.\u201d Schumer said last week that Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and oversee changes to the Affordable Care Act, will endure heavy scrutiny once his hearing is scheduled. Price is bound to face attacks for his support for privatizing Medicare and over stock he has owned in health insurance, pharmaceutical and biotech companies despite serving on a health-care subcommittee. Schumer and others have called on the House Ethics Committee to begin investigating Price\u2019s stock holdings before his confirmation hearing. Republicans noted that several senators on the health panel have similar stock holdings. Democrats are also targeting Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a fiscal conservative tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget; Andrew Puzder, a restaurant executive set to serve as labor secretary who opposes raising the minimum wage and has made controversial comments about women; Steven Mnuchin, a billionaire former Goldman Sachs partner set to serve as treasury secretary; and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who was picked by Trump to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, which he has sued in the past. Anticipating political combat, Trump\u2019s transition office has tapped incoming White House Communications Director Sean Spicer and Bryan Lanza, a veteran of the Trump campaign, to oversee hearing preparations. They are offering strategic advice and sitting in on practice sessions for nominees, according to R.C. Hammond, a transition spokesman. Party luminaries, including former Texas senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and former Arizona senator Jon Kyl, are also on board to vouch for the nominees, transition officials confirmed. Kyl was spotted shadowing Sessions at the Capitol last week. Ron Bonjean, a longtime Republican operative who has worked for the Senate and House leadership, also joined the transition team last week as an adviser focused on the most politically sensitive nominees. Tillerson and Mnuchin, who some Republicans privately worry could face difficult exchanges with senators from both parties, are being assisted by several former officials from George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Mnuchin\u2019s team includes Tara Bradshaw, a Bush-era spokeswoman at the Treasury Department, and Mary Waters, an official in the Agriculture Department under Bush. Tillerson\u2019s team includes Christian Whiton, who worked at the State Department during the Bush presidency; and Margaret Peterlin, a former Commerce Department official and senior House Republican aide. Collectively, these former senators and administration officials, who come armed with deep familiarity with the arcane nature of the Senate and the complex policies a nominee will tackle, are known as \u201csherpas.\u201d But as one transition official quipped: \u201cThere\u2019s no climbing equipment or walking toward mountains involved.\u201d Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.", "qid": 870, "docid": "e85a97ee-d348-11e6-9cb0-54ab630851e8", "score": 10.443499565124512}, {"content": "Title: \u2018We just want to be accepted.\u2019 At a vigil, transgender people mourn one of their own. Content: Social change in America can seem mighty. And mighty slow. Look at those who are transgender. In the past few years, they have posed on the cover of magazines, starred in TV shows, taken jobs at the White House and won the right to serve openly in the military. One of the country\u2019s highest- paid female chief executives \u2014 Martine Rothblatt \u2014 is a transgender woman. But if you knew Dee Dee Dodds, and you were one of those folks standing in the hot rain at a vigil for her Saturday night and you held hands with others and sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome,\u201d then progress, change, tolerance and acceptance seem mighty far off. \u201cYou can\u2019t help who you are. And we just want to be accepted,\u201d said Janiya Littman, who knew Dodds before she was shot on the Fourth of July and died nine days later. \u201cI am still scared. I\u2019m always looking over my shoulder. Every single day.\u201d While the glitzy, wealthy, high-profile trans world seems to be thriving, the trans world that still lives in the margins \u2014 the place it has existed for decades \u2014 remains an unsteady and frightening place. Deeniquia \u201cDee Dee\u201d Dodds, 22, lived in that place. She worked as a prostitute. And whenever she went out to turn tricks, her family members always said: \u201cBe sure to tell them who you are. What you are,\u201d said Joe Ann Lewis, Dodds\u2019s aunt. And they gave her all of those warnings when she got her purse and extra condoms and went out July 4. It was about 3 a.m. in the 200 block of Division Street NE when someone shot her in the neck and fled. Dodds was on life support until her death Wednesday. Police are still unsure of a motive in Dodds\u2019s shooting, and they are not calling it a hate crime. But as is the case with so many transgender people, she lived and died in the shadowy world where violence and instability are standard fare. And their path there is usually paved with hate, a hate that too often starts at home. \u201cA lot of people around here, they find out someone\u2019s gay or trans or something like that? They turn them out,\u201d said Lewis, who raised Dodds since infancy. That is usually a quick path to homelessness and, eventually, sex work. \u201cI know. When I was 22, that\u2019s what I was doing,\u201d said Earline Budd, 57, a longtime activist in the transgender world who knew Dodds. But it was different for Dodds, who found a loving family that did not necessarily understand the psychology of what was happening and that did not follow studies and trends and the changing debate about the nature of transgender people. They simply loved their little boy Gregory and wanted him to be happy. \u201cGreg was different right away. As a boy, we knew he was different,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cHe wanted girl clothes ever since he was little. I bought him boy clothes, and you know what he did? He cut them all up.\u201d Lewis let him play dress-up at home, but Dodds never stopped talking about being a girl. It was a distraction at home, but it dominated everything in school at St. Coletta of Greater Washington, where Dodds was a special-education student. Eventually, the teachers there let Dodds come to school in girl\u2019s clothing, and the distraction was gone; Dodds\u2019s behavior and class work got better, too, Lewis said. At age 13 or 14, Dodds started asking to be called Dee Dee, because, Lewis said, that\u2019s the sound he made as a baby, \u201cWhaa, dee-dee, whaa, dee-dee.\u201d And when Dodds officially changed his name, he made it Deeniquia, just to be a little fancy, Lewis said. Still, the body and the clothing made it hard for Dodds to have a legitimate job in the business world after finishing school. And that\u2019s the second path that so often steers transgender people into the shadows. \u201cThe most important thing is employment. Being able to work can change everything,\u201d Budd said. She has been fighting workplace discrimination for years. Transgender professors, researchers, teachers, executives and scientists have reported workplace harassment and even being fired, according to the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign. It\u2019s not easy to measure the level of discrimination for job applicants in low-paying fields. And that\u2019s where the push into the margins is usually the final straw. I remember meeting an impeccably dressed, young transgender woman who was on her way to a job interview at a department store in the District. She looked like the ideal saleswoman: fashion savvy, friendly, competent, clothes-obsessed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried so many places. Once they find out who I am, they never hire me.\u201d And this is why a life on the margin remains a stubborn part of being trans. And it\u2019s why nationwide debates such as the one about which restroom transgender people can use are important. More transgender people were killed in 2015 \u2014 21 \u2014 than in any other year on record, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Six have been killed in the District since 2002. It\u2019s not enough to watch Caitlyn Jenner or Laverne Cox on TV. It\u2019s not enough to have offices and officials include the T in all of their logos. It\u2019s not even enough to let transgender children use whatever restroom the child wants. The death of Dee Dee Dodds is proof of that. **Twitter: @petulad** **Read more Petula Dvorak:** \u2018Ghostbusters,\u2019 the bros who hate it and the art of modern misogyny Frigid offices, freezing women, oblivious men: An air-conditioning investigation A home that looks perfect, until bigotry rears its ugly head Men who had guns but weren\u2019t shot by police: Guess what they have in common?", "qid": 870, "docid": "15249212-4cf7-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583", "score": 10.440199851989746}, {"content": "Title: In Sessions hearing, \u2018senatorial courtesy\u2019 is lost in the tumult of Trump Content: He was interrupted, many times, by strident protesters. He was grilled about the 2016 presidential campaign \u2014 everything from cries of \u201clock her up\u201d to Donald Trump boasting about an unwanted sexual advance, on tape. When one senator asked attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions to explain an old quote about criminal sentencing, the Alabama senator bristled. \u201cI think that\u2019s rather unfair, based on our relationship and how we work together,\u201d Sessions told Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cSenatorial courtesy,\u201d the unwritten tradition by which a senator nominated for a Cabinet post typically wins easy confirmation, may be the latest norm lost in the tumult of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory. On Monday night, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) announced plans to become the first senator ever to testify against a colleague. On Tuesday morning, he watched the first few hours of the day of Sessions\u2019s hearings from a seat right behind the committee\u2019s Democrats. \u201cTo remain silent at this time to me is unacceptable,\u201d Booker told The Washington Post. \u201cEven if it means breaking norms on issues of this kind of gravity, I could not have sat well with my own self to remain silent on issues that are the core of our conceptions of justice.\u201d Inside the hearing room, protests broke out at quiet moments. Several in the audience called Sessions and Trump racists or fascists; one simply laughed loudly when Sessions was praised for his character. Outside the room, Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza \u2014 a Hispanic civil rights group \u2014 cheered Booker\u2019s decision to take the unprecedented step of testifying against a fellow senator. \u201cI think everything\u2019s fair right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a senator who has said that in some ways he\u2019s changed since what we saw in 1986, but what we have heard and what he has said hasn\u2019t reflected any changes, particularly as it relates to the Hispanic community and immigrants.\u201d Sessions is not quite the first senator to face stiff opposition from his peers. In 2013, Republicans blistered a former Nebraska senator, Chuck Hagel, on his way to the Pentagon. And in 2001, Democrats nearly blocked the nomination of former Missouri senator John Ashcroft to lead the Justice Department. The last Cabinet nominee to lose a high-profile confirmation battle, in 1989, was former Texas senator John Tower. Sessions, well-liked personally in the Senate, did not arrive at the hearing under any new cloud of scandal. Instead, Democrats and outside groups had spent the months since his nomination raking over the issues that had torpedoed his 1986 bid for a judgeship and his senatorial views of the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights enforcement. On Tuesday, a letter surfaced from the widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., who had urged Congress to block Sessions\u2019s nomination for the judiciary. Senate Democrats, often prefacing their remarks by describing their friendship with the senator, went on to see where Sessions would back away from his record or from Trump. Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), who said that Democrats would not misrepresent Sessions \u2014 \u201ccertainly don\u2019t want to do that to our colleague\u201d \u2014 used much of his time to establish that Sessions\u2019s defenders had overstated his role in prosecuting some voter discrimination cases. Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) asked Sessions repeatedly to reject the idea of a registry or database for Muslims in America. \u201cThis experience is a difficult one, not only because you\u2019re a colleague,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) \u201cI consider you to be a friend.\u201d From there, he asked Sessions if he would appoint special counsels to investigate possible Trump conflicts of interest, and got inconclusive answers. But Booker\u2019s plans, which first surfaced Monday, represented the highest-profile challenge to Sessions. On Monday night, Republicans quickly began circulating clips of the New Jersey senator praising Sessions at a ceremony last year. The two had worked with other lawmakers to ensure that activists who\u2019d marched for voting rights earned the Congressional Gold Medal. \u201cI feel blessed and honored to have partnered with Sen. Sessions in being the Senate sponsors of this important award,\u201d Booker said at the event last February. In an interview, Booker said that he would address his past praise of Sessions in his testimony. \u201cI am really proud to have worked with Jeff Sessions on awarding that medal to those marchers,\u201d he said. \u201cI am really grateful for the collegial relationship that he and I have had, the frank conversation, the decorum with which he had greeted me and I hope that he thinks I have greeted him. I met with him [Monday] with staff there, and that feeling of goodwill was there and he knew I was going to testify.\u201d Current and former senators expressed surprise at Booker\u2019s decision, and at the work Democrats and allied groups were doing to weigh down Sessions with his voting record and quotes. \u201cIt does show the partisan divide in the Senate today,\u201d said former Republican senator Mike DeWine, who is now Ohio\u2019s attorney general. \u201cThat was starting when I was here, we had certainly some of that. It appears to me to have gotten worse. I think it\u2019s sad.\u201d DeWine added that he thought Booker\u2019s testimony would have \u201cno impact\u201d on Sessions\u2019s ultimate confirmation. So did Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who said that Sessions\u2019s surprise announcement that he plans to recuse himself from any Justice Department dealings with former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and her ties to her family\u2019s charitable foundation, \u201cought to give those who had an issue with him some comfort.\u201d Flake had arrived in Washington as a congressman in 2001; DeWine reached the Senate in 1995. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pronounced himself \u201cvery disappointed that Senator Booker has chosen to start his 2020 presidential campaign\u201d with the testimony. \u201cSen. Booker says he feels compelled to speak out because Sen. Sessions wants to keep criminals behind bars, drugs off our streets, and amnesty from becoming law,\u201d Cotton wrote. \u201cSen. Booker is better than that and he knows better.\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), the chamber\u2019s only black Republican senator, announced late Monday that he would be voting to confirm Sessions. He did so after months of consideration that included research of his colleague\u2019s past statements and a visit with Sessions to meet with law enforcement and religious leaders in Charleston, S.C. \u201cI thought it was my responsibility to be painstaking on understanding and appreciating what has been said and what is true\u201d about Sessions, Scott explained. \u201cAnd then, do enough research to come to a conclusion based on people who know him intimately and what they say as well.\u201d Scott said he spoke with Albert Turner Jr., whose parents were prosecuted by Sessions for voter fraud \u2014 an incident that senators cited as a reason to reject Sessions for a federal judgeship in 1986 \u2013 and who has endorsed Sessions for attorney general. Scott said he also spoke with other Alabama Democrats and civil rights leaders who were supporting Sessions despite their decades of work that might seem counter to the Alabama senator\u2019s positions. After that careful study, \u201cI think I have a pretty clear picture of who he is, and with that information it was easy for me to conclude that the reality of Jeff Sessions is different than what people are protesting today,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI like Cory Booker, and I think it\u2019s an unusual, obviously unique \u2014 first time I think it\u2019s been done \u2014 I think we\u2019ll know what this means 20 years looking back.\u201d Booker is set to testify alongside Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon who marched with King through Selma, Ala., in 1965, and Cedric L.

Speaking at a hastily called news conference at the Justice Department, Sessions said he was following the recommendation of department ethics officials after an evaluation of the rules and cases in which he might have a conflict. \u201cThey said that since I had involvement with the campaign, I should not be involved in any campaign investigation,\u201d Sessions said. He added that he concurred with their assessment and would thus recuse himself from any existing or future investigation involving President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. It also represents a departure from Sessions\u2019s previous statements, including one on Monday, when he declined to say whether he would recuse himself. \u201cI would recuse myself on anything I should recuse myself on,\u201d Sessions said then. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d Democrats have been calling for him to do so for weeks; on Thursday, after publication of The Post\u2019s article, some high-level Republicans joined them. At his news conference, Sessions offered a new explanation: that discussions about his recusal had begun before the revelation of his meetings with Kislyak, that he and ethics officials had agreed on Monday to meet for a final time Thursday, and that at that final meeting he had accepted their recommendation. The responsibility to oversee the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation will now be handled by Sessions\u2019s deputy attorney general, the department\u2019s second-highest-ranking official. The acting deputy attorney general is Dana Boente, a longtime federal prosecutor and former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who stepped in when Trump fired Sally Yates in January. Trump\u2019s nominee for deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, is scheduled to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing on March 7. Rosenstein, the former U.S. attorney in Baltimore and the longest-serving U.S. attorney, was the sole holdover from the George W. Bush administration. The revelations about Sessions\u2019s meetings with Kislyak brought new scrutiny to the attorney general\u2019s confirmation hearing in January, when he was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign had communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. He replied: \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d On Thursday, Sessions defended those remarks as \u201chonest and correct as I understood it at the time,\u201d though he also said he would \u201cwrite the Judiciary Committee soon \u2014 today or tomorrow \u2014 to explain this testimony for the record.\u201d His explanation, he said, was that he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Franken\u2019s question, which referred to a breaking news story at the time about contacts between Trump surrogates and Russians. \u201cIt struck me very hard, and that\u2019s what I focused my answer on,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have slowed down and said I did meet one Russian official a couple times, and that would be the ambassador.\u201d Later, in an interview on Fox News, Sessions notably declined to say that he thought Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government favored Trump over Hillary Clinton in the presidential campaign. A declassified report from U.S. intelligence agencies released in January concluded just that, saying, \u201cPutin and the Russian government aspired to help President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.\u201d \u201cDid the campaign believe that the Russian government, the Putin government, favored Trump over Clinton in this race?\u201d Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked. \u201cI have never been told that,\u201d Sessions responded. \u201cDo you think they did?\u201d Carlson said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea, Tucker, you\u2019d have to ask them,\u201d Sessions said. In a statement issued Wednesday night, Sessions said he \u201cnever met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\u201d A spokeswoman confirmed his meetings with Kislyak but said there was nothing misleading about what Sessions said to Congress. The spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said Sessions did not meet with Kislyak as a Trump supporter but, rather, in his capacity as a member of the Armed Services Committee. One meeting was in September; the other in July, when Sessions was approached after an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. A Justice Department official said Wednesday of the September meeting: \u201cThere\u2019s just not strong recollection of what was said.\u201d On Thursday, though, Sessions outlined fairly extensive details of the encounter, which included two senior Sessions staffers. He said he talked with the ambassador about a trip he made to Russia in 1991, terrorism and Ukraine \u2014 a major policy issue, given Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the imposition of U.S. and European Union sanctions on Russia for its actions. At one point, Sessions said, \u201cit got to be a little bit of a testy conversation.\u201d He said the ambassador invited him to lunch, but he did not accept. \u201cMost of these ambassadors are pretty gossipy, and they like to \u2014 this was in the campaign season, but I don\u2019t recall any specific political discussions,\u201d Sessions said. Earlier Thursday, Trump said that he had \u201ctotal\u201d confidence in Sessions. Speaking aboard the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford in Newport News, Va., Trump told reporters that he was not aware of Sessions\u2019s contact with the Russian ambassador. Trump also said that Sessions \u201cprobably\u201d testified truthfully during his confirmation hearing in January before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Asked whether Sessions should recuse himself, Trump added: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Trump issued a statement later Thursday as well: \u201cJeff Sessions is an honest man. He did not say anything wrong. He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional.\u201d Trump added that Democrats are \u201coverplaying their hand\u201d by criticizing Sessions, and he called their attacks a \u201ctotal witch hunt!\u201d Several Republican lawmakers had already called on Sessions to recuse himself \u2014 and some of them applauded him after he did so. Sen. Ben. Sasse (R-Neb.) called it the \u201cright decision.\u201d Democrats, however, were less complimentary. Several of them had begun the day demanding Sessions\u2019s resignation and accusing him of lying under oath during the confirmation hearing. After his announcement that he would recuse himself, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared the decision \u201ctotally inadequate.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said: \u201cAttorney General Sessions is right to recuse himself, but the fact is that he should have done so the moment he was sworn in.\u201d The episode marks the second time in Trump\u2019s nascent administration when the truthfulness of one of its top officials has come under scrutiny. In February, Trump fired his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, after The Post reported he had not fully disclosed his contacts with Russian officials. Sessions\u2019s meetings with Kislyak occurred during the height of concerns about Russian interference in the U.S. election and at a time when Sessions was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as a top Trump surrogate and adviser. The swift response among some Republicans, although more muted than Democrats, signaled increasing concern about the potential political fallout. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) tweeted early Thursday that \u201cAG Sessions should clarify his testimony and recuse himself.\u201d Chaffetz later told reporters: \u201cLet\u2019s let him clarify his statement, and I do think he should recuse himself.\u201d Asked whether his committee would investigate the matter, he said, \u201cThere are things we are looking at.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) defended Sessions, noting that ongoing investigations have found no evidence that \u201can American or a person in the Trump campaign was involved or working with the Russians.\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) shared conflicting views on Sessions during back-to-back television interviews Thursday. Asked whether Sessions should recuse himself, he told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d \u201cI think the trust of the American people \u2014 you recuse yourself in these situations, yes.\u201d But McCarthy later told Fox News: \u201cI\u2019m not calling on him to recuse himself. I was asked on \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 if he needs to recuse himself as going forward. As you just heard, Attorney General Sessions said he would recuse himself going forward \u2014 appropriate, and that\u2019s all my answer was.\u201d Sessions has focused his response to the allegations on the substance of his conversations with Kislyak, which he said did not include talk about the campaign. Many Democrats considered that a direct contradiction of Sessions\u2019s testimony in January, when he told Franken that he had not spoken to Russian officials. But Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who considers Sessions a close friend, said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Jeff Sessions is a liar\u201d and argued that Sessions had not misled the Judiciary Committee \u201cbecause all of the questions were about campaign contacts.\u201d But Sessions \u201cdoes owe it, quite frankly, to all of us to tell us what he talked about\u201d with Kislyak, Graham said. Fallout from Sessions\u2019s statements came as FBI Director James B. Comey made a previously scheduled visit to Capitol Hill to meet with the House Intelligence Committee. But Comey was once again unwilling to confirm whether the FBI is exploring ties between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government, according to Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the committee\u2019s top Democrat. \u201cWe can\u2019t do a complete job unless the director is willing to discuss anything that they are investigating,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAt this point we know less than a fraction of what the FBI knows.\u201d But Rep. Devin Nunes \u00ad(R-Calif.), the committee\u2019s chairman, said Comey was \u201cvery upfront\u201d with lawmakers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more information . . . the FBI and intelligence agencies need to provide to our committees\u201d to aid ongoing congressional investigations, Nunes said. He added that he had \u201cno reason to believe that any information\u201d would be withheld from his committee. Senators who deal regularly with defense, foreign affairs or intelligence matters often meet with foreign officials. But as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sessions was less likely to meet with foreign ambassadors than foreign military leaders. The Post has spoken to all senators who served on the armed services panel in 2016. None of them other than Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one last year, they said. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said he met with Kislyak in 2016, but in the earlier part of the year before the presidential campaign intensified.

The department found that Wilson\u2019s actions \u201cdo not constitute a prosecutable violation\u201d and there \u201cis no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson\u2019s stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety.\u201d _[Read: The DOJ report on the police department in Ferguson] _ In a second report on broader police practices, the Justice Department released seven racist e-mails written by Ferguson police and municipal court officials. A November 2008 e-mail, for instance, stated that President Obama could not be president for very long because \u201cwhat black man holds a steady job for four years.\u201d Another e-mail described Obama as a chimpanzee. An e-mail from 2011 showed a photo of a bare chested group of dancing women apparently in Africa with the caption, \u201cMichelle Obama\u2019s High School Reunion.\u201d The Justice Department did not specifically identify who wrote the e-mails and to whom they were sent, but said they were written by police ad court supervisors who are currently employed by the city. The second report accused the police department in Ferguson, Mo., of racial bias and routinely violating the constitutional rights of black citizens by stopping drivers without reasonable suspicion, making arrests without probable cause and using excessive force, officials said. Federal officials opened their civil rights investigation into the Ferguson police department after the uproar in the St. Louis suburb and across the country over the fatal shooting of Brown last year. A grand jury in St. Louis declined to indict Wilson in November. _[The seven racist e-mails the Justice Department highlighted in its report on Ferguson police] _ Although federal officials will not bring civil rights charges against Wilson, they see their broad civil rights investigation into the troubled Ferguson police department as the way to force significant changes in Ferguson policing. \u201cAs detailed in our report, this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized, and where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents,\u201d said Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. \u201cOur investigation showed that Ferguson police officers routinely violate the Fourth Amendment in stopping people without reasonable suspicion, arresting them without probable cause, and using unreasonable force against them. Now that our investigation has reached its conclusion, it is time for Ferguson\u2019s leaders to take immediate, wholesale and structural corrective action. The report we have issued and the steps we have taken are only the beginning of a necessarily resource-intensive and inclusive process to promote reconciliation, to reduce and eliminate bias, and to bridge gaps and build understanding.\u201d Holder is expected to speak about the reports Wednesday afternoon. In hundreds of interviews and in a broad review of more than 35,000 pages of Ferguson police records and other documents, Justice Department officials found that although African Americans make up 67 percent of the population in Ferguson, they accounted for 93 percent of all arrests between 2012 and 2014. Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown\u2019s family, said the report into police practices confirms \u201cwhat Michael Brown\u2019s family has believed all along, and that is that the tragic killing of their unarmed teenage son was part of a systemic pattern of policing of African American citizens in Ferguson.\u201d _[Read: Department of Justice report on the Michael Brown shooting] _ The findings come as Justice Department officials negotiate a settlement with the police department to change its practices. If they are unable to reach an agreement, the Justice Department could bring a lawsuit, as it has done against law enforcement agencies in other jurisdictions in recent years. A U.S. official said that Ferguson officials have been cooperating. As part of its findings, the Justice Department concluded that African Americans accounted for 85 percent of all drivers stopped by Ferguson police officers and 90 percent of all citations issued. The review concludes that racial bias and a focus on generating revenue over public safety have a profound effect on Ferguson police and court practices and routinely violate the Constitution and federal law. \u201cWe owe it, not just to law enforcement, but to Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner to figure out what\u2019s really going on here so it can be addressed,\u201d said Jeff Roorda, a former Missouri state representative and a spokesman for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, referring to others killed by police officers in Cleveland and New York. \u201cReaching conclusions from statistics about traffic stops I don\u2019t think draws the whole picture.\u201d The Justice review also found a pattern or practice of Ferguson police using unreasonable force against citizens. In 88 percent of the cases in which the department used force, it was against African Americans. In Ferguson court cases, African Americans are 68 percent less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge, according to the Justice review. In 2013, African Americans accounted for 92 percent of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued. Justice investigators also reviewed types of arrests and the treatment of detainees in the city jail by Ferguson police officers. They found that from April to September 2014, 95 percent of people held longer than two days were black. The police department also overwhelmingly charges African Americans with certain petty offenses, the investigation concluded. For example, from 2011 to 2013, African Americans accounted for 95 percent of all \u201cmanner of walking in roadway\u201d charges, 94 percent of all \u201cfailure to comply\u201d charges and 92 percent of all \u201cpeace disturbance\u201d charges, the review found. The shooting of Brown on a Ferguson street on Aug. 9 set off days of often violent clashes between demonstrators and police in the streets of Ferguson. Elected officials, protest organizers and community leaders renewed calls Tuesday for Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson to resign \u2014 some adding that the department should be disbanded \u2014 and said the Justice Department probe should have gone further by investigating other municipal police forces in the area. \u201cI would speculate that the same pattern and practices of Ferguson exist in every other department in St. Louis County,\u201d said Adolphus Pruitt, the president of the St. Louis NAACP, which has filed racial discrimination complaints against county police. _[DOJ report renews outrage in Ferguson] _ He added, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Ferguson police department to disappear.\u201d Justice Department investigators spent about 100 days in Ferguson, observing police and court practices, including four sessions of the Ferguson Municipal Court. They conducted an analysis of police data on stops, searches and arrests, as well as data collected by the court, and met with neighborhood associations and advocacy groups. The investigators also interviewed city, police and court officials, including the Ferguson police chief and his command staff. In the past five years, the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division has opened more than 20 investigations of police departments, more than twice as many as were opened in the previous five. The department has entered into 15 agreements with law enforcement agencies, including consent decrees with nine of them, including the New Orleans and Albuquerque police departments.

What once passed for governing and leadership has become a spectacle of disservice by people who call themselves public servants. The dramatic collapse of Republican efforts to change the Affordable Care Act provides Congress an opportunity to repair itself by returning to something approaching bipartisan lawmaking. It won\u2019t be easily accomplished. The executive branch has been a cauldron of turbulence. Just ask Anthony Scaramucci, the swaggering, newly named White House communications director, who predicted fewer than 48 hours ago what unexpectedly transpired late Friday afternoon: Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, was ousted. The White House today has been a feuding, conniving band of officials vying for the affection of President Trump, who seems to encourage, even revel in, the chaos around him. Trump named John F. Kelly, the Homeland Security secretary, as chief of staff. The president called the retired Marine Corps general \u201ca star.\u201d But can he truly change the culture? Washington hasn\u2019t been working for some time; the breakdown began years ago. The dysfunction in Washington is one reason Trump was elected. But in the past six months, things have turned even worse, with the breakdown reaching new depths this week. For this, the Republicans and the president bear the responsibility. Until Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) cast the decisive vote on the bill for a \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of the ACA, the Senate was operating under procedures never seen before on a piece of major legislation. Legislating is never pretty \u2014 certainly passage of the Affordable Care Act was not \u2014 but there are norms usually respected by both sides. In recent weeks, those norms went out the window as Republicans struggled to fulfill a seven-year promise that is as internally divisive as it is elusive. The effort was transparently cynical as Republicans grasped for something, anything, that might collect the 50 votes needed to keep alive what has proved to be their futile hope of getting rid of Obamacare. The measure from the House was dead on arrival in the Senate. Nothing cooked up behind closed doors under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) worked, either. In desperation, the Republican leaders turned to a vehicle that no serious member of Congress believed could work. Hours before the critical vote, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) correctly branded the skinny repeal for what it was. \u201cThe skinny bill as policy is a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cThe skinny bill as a replacement for Obamacare is a fraud.\u201d Nonetheless, Graham voted for it on the pretext that it would keep the effort alive. McCain had joined Graham in lamenting the skinny bill\u2019s deficiencies, and when the time came, he acted on his words. He had drawn criticism Tuesday when he returned to the Senate for the first time after being diagnosed with brain cancer and cast the deciding vote to begin debate on the bill. Congressional leaders are now left to pick up the pieces of a shattered and demoralizing process. What\u2019s next no one can say. There will be angry words about the maverick from Arizona from some of his colleagues and from conservatives who have never trusted him. The president, who had disparaged McCain in the early days of his candidacy in 2015, has now felt the sting of payback. \u201cFrom the very beginning, it was clear that the fate of the Trump administration lay in the hands of the Senate Republicans,\u201d Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said in an email Friday. \u201cThe Republican senators dutifully but often reluctantly did his bidding, but now they must come to the realization that he is not worthy of the loyalty he demanded.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cWith the debris of the Obamacare repeal effort still in view, the survivors need to regroup and rebuild armed with a set of bipartisan blueprints.\u201d There will be much talk about the need to work toward bipartisanship. There are examples: Congress just sent Trump, with overwhelming support from both parties, a tough sanctions bill aimed at Russia that puts the president on the spot. On health care and perhaps other upcoming issues, Republicans may have to swallow their pride to achieve successes. Democrats, who have had the luxury of claiming they want to work with Republicans without actually having to do so, will have to make good their words. For seven years, Republicans have lived what turned out to be a fiction. They have many complaints about Obamacare. They have words that work in political ads and in their innumerable appearances before the cameras. But they have no solution. They may keep trying, but if they return to the scheming that got them to the moment of spectacular collapse early Friday, they will expose themselves once again to searing criticism. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, things are just as bad, though the departure of Priebus and the arrival of Kelly offers the possibility of a reset moment of the kind that now appears possible for Congress. Since Inauguration Day, the Trump administration has been rife with factionalism, built to be undisciplined by a president who lacks discipline. The boisterous arrival of Scaramucci, a New York financier and Trump loyalist, has managed in a single week to make things so much worse. Scaramucci\u2019s expletive-filled rant to the New Yorker\u2019s Ryan Lizza took all the backroom maneuvering and senior-level backstabbing and put it on full public display. His attacks on Priebus and chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon left little room for reconciliation. His broader threats show a lack of true understanding of how government works. Scaramucci tried to wash away his remarks by claiming that he sometimes uses \u201ccolorful\u201d language and that he will try to do better. What he doesn\u2019t understand is that it was more than the words that shocked; it was the attitude and the posture he struck and has struck since being named to the White House staff. Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, said there are many inadequacies in the executive branch that predate Trump, including some caused by congressional inaction. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to put it all on his plate. These are things that predated him but are getting worse under his tenure,\u201d Stier said. Trump is trying to use the model he followed as a businessman and developer, a model not suited to running the federal government, Stier said. \u201cIt appears as if everything is being run through one small pipe,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump and set of decision-makers are trying to address everything of importance in the federal government themselves. . . . So far, it doesn\u2019t seem to me they are learning the right lessons.\u201d The White House can\u2019t continue to operate this way, at least not in the true interests of the country or even those of Trump\u2019s core supporters. In just a week, the president has made it almost untenable for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to stay in the job, drawing concerns that Trump\u2019s ultimate target is Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel charged with investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia. This was not the fault of the chief of staff. It is illustrative of the problem that now falls into Kelly\u2019s lap. The problem of dysfunction extends to other parts of the executive branch. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke threatened Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska by implying that Murkowski\u2019s vote not to proceed with debate on health care could jeopardize federal support for the state, according to the Alaska Dispatch News. The State Department, by every account, is not functioning well under Secretary Rex Tillerson. The reaction to Trump\u2019s transgender military ban shows that the relationship between the White House and the Defense Department is tense. Politico\u2019s Susan Glasser reported that the national security apparatus under H.R. McMaster is not running smoothly and that Trump is not happy about it. Congress will soon depart for its annual August recess. Trump and Republican lawmakers had hoped to arrive at the summer break with a record of accomplishment, at the least with a significant down payment on the promises of the 2016 campaign. Instead, they face the bleak prospect of knowing that they have failed on their signature pledge on health care, that other legislative business remains unfinished and that the White House faces uncertain days. The president has kept one big promise, which was to disrupt the capital.

Congress has become complicit in these murders by its total, unconscionable deafening silence.\u201d But others put the threat of domestic terrorism front and center in their comments. Sen.

I have conferred with additional sources and they think there is likely a connection with ISIS,\" he said. \"So as we all mourn the senseless loss of life and investigators continue to learn more, we must remain vigilant and remember that if you see something, say something.\u201d Speaking on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d with host Chuck Todd, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) noted that the ensuing public debate would be shaped by what spurred the gunman to act. Law enforcement officials and relatives have identified the suspect, who was killed by police, as 29-year-old Omar Mateen from Fort Pierce, Fla. \u201cIf it is found out that this person was at least [inspired] by ISIS, then it\u2019ll probably be a terrorism debate,\u201d Flake told Todd. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t, it may be a gun debate. But you\u2019re right, it seems to be one or the other. \u201cA lot of us have been talking for quite a while in terms of background checks and tightening background checks, particularly as it pertains to those with mental illness,\u201d Flake said. \u201cAnd I think that that debate can and should go on as well as the debate on how to best protect us against those who were inspired or funded or directed by international terrorists.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), whose record on gun safety legislation came under attack during the Democratic presidential primaries, said later on the same show that the shooting provided yet another reason to revisit current laws. \u201cI believe that in this country we should not be selling automatic weapons, which are designed to kill people,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have got to do everything that we can on top of that to make sure guns do not fall into the hands of people who should not have them, criminals and people who are mentally ill. So, that struggle continues.\u201d", "qid": 870, "docid": "748b786d6383a8f9dd6493fde9a9be78", "score": 10.344399452209473}, {"content": "Title: The standoff between Trump and Sessions escalates Content: The public standoff between the White House and the nation\u2019s senior law enforcement official took another strange turn Tuesday as President Trump escalated his verbal attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was urged by fellow conservatives to stand his ground. Trump was asked at a Rose Garden news conference if he would fire the attorney general, who angered the president by recusing himself from the criminal probe into possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u2019\u2019 said Trump \u2014 a potentially ominous choice of phrase, considering the president used the same expression when talking to FBI Director James B. Comey before he was fired. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the attorney general,\u2019\u2019 Trump said. \u201cIf he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have picked somebody else. It\u2019s a bad thing not just for the president, but also for the presidency. I think it\u2019s unfair to the presidency.\u201d He said he wanted Sessions \u201cto be much tougher on leaks in the intelligence agencies that are leaking like they never have before. . . . You can\u2019t let that happen.\u2019\u2019 It is unheard of for a Cabinet-level official to be subjected to such visceral and public criticism, which has now gone on for a week. But Sessions showed no sign of buckling Tuesday, and in fact his position was bolstered by support from prominent conservatives taking his side in the fight with Trump. In a recent conversation, Sessions\u2019s chief of staff, Jody Hunt, told White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus that the attorney general had no intention of stepping down. Hunt, according to people familiar with the conversation, made it clear to Priebus that Sessions \u201cplans to move forward with his agenda in the department and he has no plans for resigning,\u2019\u2019 according to one person familiar with the exchange. Priebus, for his part, did not say Trump planned to fire Sessions if he did not leave, these people said. Trump\u2019s reluctance to act on his anger and fire Sessions may be based in part on the lack of an immediate plan for a successor at the Justice Department. While Trump has discussed potential candidates to replace Sessions, senior White House officials have not settled on anyone, and may not anytime soon, administration officials said. If Sessions were to be fired without even a temporary replacement lined up, the deputy attorney general who oversees the Russia probe, Rod J. Rosenstein, would assume authority over the entire Justice Department. One Republican close to the White House said a number of senior aides, including newly hired communications director Anthony Scaramucci, have urged Trump to sit down with Sessions and work through their differences. So far, there has been little enthusiasm for that suggestion, the Republican said. One informal adviser to the Trump White House said there is another reason Trump has yet to fire Sessions: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to be seen as firing another law enforcement official.\u2019\u2019 After Trump fired Comey, one unintended consequence was the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as special counsel overseeing the Russia probe. Earlier Tuesday, Trump had tweeted that Sessions was \u201cvery weak\u2019\u2019 on investigating Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u2019\u2019 and had not aggressively hunted those who have leaked intelligence secrets since he has been in office. The president\u2019s insistence that Clinton be investigated runs contrary to his own past statements, and the decision by the Justice Department and the FBI last year to close the investigation into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. Sessions has recused himself from Clinton-related matters, citing his involvement with the presidential campaign as one of Trump\u2019s major advisers. The public humiliation of Sessions at the hands of the president he helped get elected was galling to many conservatives, who see Sessions as the Cabinet official who has most assiduously pursued Trump\u2019s policy goals, from cracking down on illegal immigration to targeting street gangs. Officials said Sessions is due to announce in coming days a number of criminal leak investigations based on news accounts of sensitive intelligence information. And within hours of Trump\u2019s public broadside, the Justice Department announced it would change a police funding program to add new requirements that cities help federal agents find undocumented immigrants to receive grants. On Tuesday, Republicans publicly rallied to Sessions\u2019s defense. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said Sessions \u201cis among the most honorable men in government today \u2026 I have full confidence in Jeff\u2019s ability to perform the duties of his office and, above all, uphold the rule of law.\u2019\u2019 And Breitbart, the conservative website, posted an article saying the president\u2019s public attack on Sessions \u201conly serves to highlight Trump\u2019s own hypocrisy\u201d and it warned that the president\u2019s stance could \u201cfuel concerns from his base [which sees] Sessions as the best hope to fulfill Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\u2019\u2019 Even among Democrats, Trump\u2019s treatment of Sessions raised concerns. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is just terrible. The attorney general did the right thing. The attorney general was nothing but loyal to Donald Trump. He took an oath of office to represent the Constitution, the law and the people.\u2019\u2019 Current and former Justice Department officials said they hope Sessions holds out, refusing to resign as a means of defending the department\u2019s independence. One former Justice Department official said the president\u2019s anger seems to stem from a misunderstanding about how the department actually works. The White House, he said, should not be interfering with criminal investigations. \u201cFor those of us that want this administration to succeed, this is incredibly self-destructive behavior,\u2019\u2019 the official said. Justice Department employees said the president\u2019s comments are damaging the reputation and morale of the department. \u201cIt\u2019s just insanity,\u2019\u2019 said one employee who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Another official said there was still hope in the building that Sessions could survive, and that Trump\u2019s fury might abate. \u201cThis might be the one instance where everyone else just kind of rolls their eyes and moves on,\u2019\u2019 the official said. The surge of support for Sessions is remarkable, considering how isolated he has been within the government. Sessions is viewed warily by many at the FBI for his role in Comey\u2019s firing, and he is increasingly distant from the White House, despite the fact that some of his former Senate staffers serve there. Administration officials said the president and his staff are also upset that Sessions held a news conference last Friday, in which he said he planned to remain on the job. Some in the White House saw that statement as unnecessarily antagonizing the president. \u201cCan you imagine any other president having to go this far to tell someone you need to go?\u2019\u2019 said a person informally advising the White House. \u201cWhen Sessions said he wouldn\u2019t resign, it\u2019s like poking fire. You know who you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Yet within the Justice Department, that reaction was viewed as another indication of how little White House officials appear to understand what the Justice Department does. The news conference had been scheduled a week earlier based on an arrest overseas, and a senior European law enforcement official had flown in to participate. Canceling the news conference, Justice Department officials reasoned at the time, would be a bigger problem than going forward. Sessions tried to keep his answers low-key, they added. Officials at Justice said the standoff is beginning to affect the department\u2019s work. One official said the pace of meetings with senior leaders has slowed, and the dust-up has distracted from some policy goals. At a confirmation hearing Tuesday, Brian Benczkowski, a former Sessions aide and a nominee for assistant attorney general, said he had \u201cevery confidence\u201d that his ex-boss made the right decision to recuse himself on the Russia investigation, and forcefully asserted that Mueller \u2014 whose work he said he did not consider a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d \u2014 would do the right thing. \u201cHe is someone who is widely understood to be a man of integrity, a man of independence, and someone who I believe will conduct his investigation with those characteristics right at the forefront, and I also believe he\u2019ll insist on those same things from the people who work for him,\u201d Benczkowski said.

That, at least, is the story Vallum, a member of the Latin Kings street gang, told sheriff\u2019s deputies in George County, Miss., after 17-year-old Williamson was discovered in a shallow grave last spring. Even as Vallum\u2019s sentencing seemed to close the murder case, however, questions remained about his account of the killing.

At first, however, authorities in Mississippi did not identify Williamson as transgender. She was born Michael Christopher Wilkins and grew up in the small coastal city of Gulf Shores, Ala. At a young age, however, Williamson began to identify as a girl. Williamson was a happy teenager with a habit of flipping the dark hair that hung well below her shoulders. Miller last saw Williamson on June 30 when the teen left the camper to meet someone. \u201cThe last thing she said to me was \u2018Love ya later,\u2019\u201d Miller told the newspaper. The person Williamson met was Vallum. Vallum was a decade older than Williamson and had been a member of the Latin Kings for eight years, according to authorities. He had risen to become the gang\u2019s statewide secretary, in charge of collecting dues from members, and had a large tattoo on his left arm featuring a crown and his street name: King Chaos. How well the two knew each other is disputed. During a June pre-trial hearing, a roommate of Williamson\u2019s testified anonymously that the 17-year-old and Vallum were open with their affection, and the dangers they faced from the Latin Kings, which forbids members from homosexuality. One day, the roommate was sitting on their front porch with the couple when Williamson said she and Vallum would be killed if gang members learned the truth about them. The roommate said Vallum knew Williamson was transgender, and that the two spent several nights a week together, often hanging out in their underwear. They called each other \u201cbaby,\u201d openly expressed their love for one another and had enjoyed an active sex life, she said. Once, Vallum even took her to a Latin Kings beach party, the roommate testified. Vallum, however, told investigators he barely knew Williamson. He claimed the two were kissing when he discovered she was transgender and snapped, blacking out and regaining consciousness only when Williamson was already dead, according to the Sun Herald. The murder weapon, a hammer, was in his hand. After the killing, Vallum put the hammer and a stun gun into a plastic bag and threw it off a bridge, he told George County sheriff\u2019s deputies. On May 30, 2015, likely the day of the killing, Vallum arrived at his father\u2019s house in Lucedale, Miss., near the border with Alabama. Vallum walked in with blood on his shoulders, his brother, Jacob, testified. \u201cI asked him, \u2018What the heck happened?\u2019\u201d Jacob Vallum said, according to the Sun Herald. \u201cWell, it was my life or his,\u201d Josh responded, according to his brother. A friend recalled a similar conversation two days later. When Jacob Vallum walked into Danielle Marie Merrill\u2019s house on June 1, 2015, she asked him what had been going on. He replied that he didn\u2019t have \u201cenough of a buzz to talk about it,\u201d she testified. After grabbing a beer from her fridge, however, he began talking. Vallum said he had buried a body on his father\u2019s property, Merrill testified. Stunned, she asked him to repeat himself. \u201cHe \u2026 said it was either him or the other dude\u201d Merrill said in court, according to the Sun Herald. He also said his victim \u201chad too much information on him and he wasn\u2019t going down.\u201d That same day, Josh Vallum told his father what he had done, according to a police report obtained by the newspaper. The next morning, Vallum\u2019s father accompanied four George County sheriff\u2019s deputies as they searched the woods behind his house. Within an hour, they found Williamson\u2019s body, hastily concealed under some debris. Vallum was arrested the same day and charged with murder. DNA confirmed that the body belonged to Williamson.

Robert G. Marshall (Prince William) fumed at members of a GOP-controlled House subcommittee after they used an unrecorded voice vote to dispatch with his bill. He said their actions were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Marshall had proposed legislation similar to what passed with great controversy in North Carolina last year. His bill would have required people to use the restroom that corresponds with the gender on their original birth certificates. He softened the measure somewhat as the House General Laws subcommittee took it up in an afternoon hearing, proposing an amendment to strike the word \u201coriginal\u201d from the legislation. The amendment would have allowed those who undergo sex-reassignment therapy or surgery and who have their birth certificates changed to reflect that to use the bathroom associated with their gender identity. \u201cIf someone goes through the process of changing their sex \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very smart because such people have very high rates of self-harm. That\u2019s documented, not from me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they go through that, fine. Let them use that bathroom.\u201d Marshall said the purpose of the bill was to protect women and girls from predatory men who might pretend to be transgender to gain access to areas where women are undressed. Dubbing his bill the \u201cPhysical Privacy Act,\u201d Marshall bristled at its more common description as the \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d He said his main concern was not bathrooms, where stalls provide a measure of privacy, but public locker rooms, where women could be forced to undress and shower in full view of men who claim to be transgender. A handful of conservative and liberal activists testified for and against the measure. Then, with no discussion among the subcommittee\u2019s five Republicans and two Democrats, Del. Barry D. Knight (R-Virginia Beach) moved to lay the bill on the table. The action kills the bill unless the subcommittee reverses itself within a week\u2019s time, Marshall said. One member, Del. Thomas C. Wright Jr. (R-Lunenburg), raised a finger in a manner that seemed to indicate he opposed the motion. The vote tally was unrecorded, as is typical for voice votes. Subcommittee members continued with their meeting after the vote and were not immediately available for comment. \u201cThey don\u2019t even want to defend their oath,\u201d Marshall said later. \u201cThat\u2019s disgusting.\u201d Marshall had never expected the bill would become law, at least not under Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), who had vowed to veto it if it got to his desk. But he hoped to pressure Republican leaders to let it get to the floor of the House. One of the most vocal conservatives in the General Assembly, Marshall has often accused Republican leaders of killing his social-issue bills to avoid controversy. _An earlier version of this article erroneously reported that Marshall used the word \u201cdisgusting\u201d to describe the legislators, rather than their actions.

Rosenstein is, by most accounts, about as good a nominee for deputy attorney general as Democrats could hope for. And if the Trump administration gets its way, he could soon be the man handling the most politically charged investigation in the nation. The U.S. attorney for Maryland has sterling bipartisan credentials stretching back to the Clinton administration. The longest-serving U.S. attorney, Rosenstein was unanimously confirmed to his post, based in Baltimore, in 2005 after being nominated by then-President George W. Bush and winning support from the state\u2019s two Democratic senators. He kept the job in 2009 when President Barack Obama arrived, and on Tuesday, after the new Republican administration nominated Rosenstein to the No. 2 post in the Justice Department, Sens. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) happily introduced him to the Judiciary Committee. Yet Rosenstein might receive little Democratic support, and some have signaled that they intend to slow-walk his nomination and stretch out the confirmation process through the rest of the month because they want a special prosecutor to take charge of DOJ\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and Trump associates\u2019 links to the Kremlin. That\u2019s because, in recusing himself from any investigations of President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Attorney General Jeff Sessions handed the case to whoever will be his No. 2 \u2014 meaning Rosenstein, if he is confirmed. The situation has left Democrats wrapped inside their own paradoxical box: The price of their support for a speedy confirmation is Rosenstein promising to appoint a special prosecutor. \u201cIf Mr. Rosenstein is unwilling to commit to naming a special prosecutor, or says that he needs to be confirmed and in his position before he can make an assessment \u2014 that is insufficient,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech Tuesday morning. \u201cThe need for a special prosecutor is clear enough today to make that call.\u201d A little more than an hour after Sessions announced last week that he would recuse himself from any Trump-related cases, Sen. Richard J. Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said he would use \u201cevery possible tool to block\u201d Rosenstein\u2019s confirmation until the nominee committed to naming a special prosecutor. But that is the type of commitment that almost no nominee would ever make. That sort of answer would seem to prejudge a case before someone has reviewed the investigative material. It is typically considered a big no-no for judges and other executive branch nominees to key positions to tip their hands in confirmation hearings, leading to decades of answers by nominees with well-rehearsed lines about upholding the law without taking a formal stand. That\u2019s exactly what Rosenstein did Tuesday, deflecting questions about his view of the case by promising to follow the advice of Justice Department experts. \u201cI would evaluate the facts and the law [and] consider the applicable law,\u201d he told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). He promised to use \u201cmy best judgment\u201d in handling the Russia investigation and vowed to take the \u201cright course of action.\u201d He noted that he has not been allowed to review the case because he has not been confirmed. The standoff over Rosenstein sets up a scenario in which Democrats will continue to demand the appointment of a special prosecutor in a Trump-related Russia inquiry. Yet they will be holding up the confirmation of the one person who might actually make such an appointment. Republicans are in what may be an even stranger position. They have almost uniformly rejected calls for a special prosecutor, saying that an investigation can be dealt with in the normal ranks of the Justice Department and in the congressional intelligence committees. Grassley began the hearing by highlighting Rosenstein\u2019s record handling sensitive cases, including a leak investigation in the Obama administration, and reminded Democrats of how a special prosecutor was not called to direct the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s treatment of classified information when she served as a secretary of state. Yet in calling for Rosenstein\u2019s speedy confirmation, Grassley and Republicans may be demanding the appointment of an official who might disagree with them and decide to set up a more robust, independent investigation of alleged Russian ties to the Trump 2016 campaign. That\u2019s the view of someone who has watched Rosenstein up close. Cardin, a former member of the Judiciary Committee, recommended in 2009 that Obama retain Rosenstein as the state\u2019s top federal prosecutor, telling the panel Tuesday that a broad cross-section of Maryland\u2019s legal community supported him. \u201cThis was a welcomed nomination by President Trump,\u201d Cardin told the panel, recounting the \u201ctotally nonpartisan professional manner\u201d Rosenstein adopted in his investigations. Like his fellow Democrats, Cardin thinks a more vigorous investigation is needed in the Russia case, with an independent commission being his preferred body. Unlike many Democrats, he is willing to support Rosenstein without his public guarantee of calling for such an inquiry. \u201cI think that Mr. Rosenstein is the right person at the right time for deputy attorney general,\u201d Cardin told his colleagues. He predicted that the nominee\u2019s record would lead to decisions that Democrats will applaud. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, agreed that Rosenstein is \u201cwell-qualified\u201d but she highlighted the conflicts within the Justice Department in the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency. After Trump issued his first travel ban, which prevented all refugees as well as visitors from seven Muslim-majority nations, then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates refused to defend the executive order and was fired by Trump. \u201cThis is about the integrity of the process,\u201d Feinstein said, noting that she feared Trump\u2019s West Wing would exert influence over the investigation. \u201cThere is a real danger, I believe, that the Justice Department could become politicized.\u201d Blumenthal and other Democrats pointed to the 1973 confirmation of Elliot Richardson as attorney general, during which he vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to oversee the Watergate investigations. They want a similar pledge from Rosenstein \u2014 and are prepared to delay his confirmation as long as they can. \u201cThis situation is extraordinary,\u201d Blumenthal said, \u201cand he is a professional career prosecutor who knows that there is a need \u2014 who should know, should know \u2014 there is a need for independence and protection from political influence here.\u201d _Read more fromPaul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ ****", "qid": 870, "docid": "ba7841d0-0342-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10", "score": 10.302399635314941}, {"content": "Title: Justice Department releases portion of Sessions security clearance form claiming no contacts with foreign officials Content: The Justice Department on Thursday released a single redacted page from Attorney General Jeff Session\u2019s security clearance form from November that indicated he had not had any contact with a foreign government official in the past seven years. That contradicts his later admission that he had met with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, twice last year. At the time, Sessions was a U.S. senator and an adviser to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. The meetings occurred in July and September. Sessions\u2019s omission may not be a violation of security clearance rules as long as the contacts occurred in his capacity as a lawmaker, U.S. officials say. But other experts say he should have erred on the side of transparency. The watchdog group American Oversight, whose lawsuit forced the disclosure of the form, said that FBI investigators should have been told about the meetings. The group learned Thursday in court that the bureau did not turn up the information on its own. Sessions disclosed the meetings only after The Washington Post inquired for an article published in March. The question on the form, known as an SF86, asks the applicant to say whether he has had \u201cany contact with a foreign government,\u201d such as an embassy or its representatives, inside or outside the United States in the past seven years. Sessions put an \u201cX\u201d in the box marked \u201cNo.\u201d Ian Prior, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement that Sessions\u2019s staff was told by the FBI investigator handling the background check that he need not list meetings with foreign dignitaries in connection with Senate activities. Other U.S. government officials with clearances who have dealt extensively with foreign officials say they, too, have been advised that they don\u2019t need to list contacts with such officials. \u201cIt would be a different matter if [Sessions] was acting in his capacity as a campaign adviser,\u201d said an aide to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), whose office looked into the matter. Sessions met with Kislyak in July during the Republican National Convention and in September in his Senate office. Evan Lesser, an expert in security clearance investigations, said it\u2019s better to report the contacts. \u201cThe lines can be blurry between conversations that you might have with a foreign national that specifically relate to Senate work and something that may be outside that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to list everything.\u201d Sessions, an early Trump supporter who advised the campaign on foreign policy, was nominated in November to be attorney general. The job he was being vetted for \u2014 the highest law enforcement official in the country \u2014 is very sensitive, and any contacts with Russian officials would have been good to disclose, said Lesser, president of ClearanceJobs.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about foreign influence, but could someone hold some sway over you?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s precisely why you\u2019re required to list the entirety of your foreign connections, including meetings and financial ties. It\u2019s really to understand, is there a potential conflict of interest, or could this person be coerced in some kind of way?\u201d Sessions did not disclose his Kislyak meetings during his confirmation hearing in January. His explanation was that he had met with the ambassador as a member of the Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump adviser. Nonetheless, watchdog groups see Sessions\u2019s answer as part of a troubling pattern of Trump associates not disclosing contacts with the Russian government. Last year, Trump officials insisted that the campaign had not had any communication with Russian officials. This week, the New York Times reported that Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr.; son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer whom they thought had information from the Russian government that could help Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cFrom Jeff Sessions to Jared Kushner to Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s closest confidants appear to have collective amnesia about their dealings with the Russian government,\u201d said Austin Evers, the executive director of American Oversight.", "qid": 870, "docid": "b52d607e-67d4-11e7-9928-22d00a47778f", "score": 10.297599792480469}, {"content": "Title: Senate confirms Jeff Sessions as attorney general Content: The Senate on Wednesday confirmed Jeff Sessions as the next attorney general, following a bitter debate in the chamber that saw Republicans formally rebuke Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for the manner in which she criticized her colleague from Alabama. Sessions, a four-term U.S. senator, was the first senator to endorse Trump in February 2016, and his conservative, populist views have shaped many of the administration\u2019s early policies, including on immigration. The vote, 52-47 in favor of confirmation, ran largely down party lines. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) was the only Democrat who supported him. Sessions voted present. Republicans accused Democrats of seeking to undercut Trump by attempting to derail his cabinet choices. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that our Democrat colleagues don\u2019t like the new president and are doing what they can to undermine the new administration,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the Judiciary Committee chairman. He expressed disappointment in colleagues who, he said, suggested Sessions won\u2019t be able to put aside his policy preferences and enforce the law. \u201cThis is especially troubling after he specifically committed to us during his confirmation hearing that, if he\u2019s confirmed, he will follow the law, regardless of whether he supported the statute as a policy matter,\u201d Grassley said. Leading Democrats have argued that Trump\u2019s criticisms of the federal courts over his immigration order makes the need for an attorney general who will be willing to disagree with the president even more urgent. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a president who belittles judges when they don\u2019t agree with him,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a president who is willing to shake the roots of the Constitution and a fundamental premise \u2014 no religious test \u2014 that\u2019s embodied in our Constitution within his first few weeks in office,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe certainly need an attorney general who will stand up to that president \u2026. But [Sessions] is not, if you can say one thing about him, he\u2019s not independent of Donald Trump.\u201d Sessions, 70, advanced out of the judiciary committee last week after a vote along party lines. The hearing took place after then-acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, an Obama administration holdover, had ordered the department\u2019s lawyers not to defend Trump\u2019s immigration order on grounds that she was not convinced it was lawful. Within hours, Trump fired her. In his confirmation hearing last month, Sessions repeatedly vowed to put the law above his personal views. He said he would abide by the Supreme Court decision underpinning abortion rights and a court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage. He said he understood that the waterboarding of terrorism suspects to elicit information is \u201cabsolutely improper and illegal\u201d and, though he voted against it, he would uphold a law banning the government\u2019s bulk collection of phone records. He also declared that he would recuse himself from Justice Department probe of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email practices or her family\u2019s charitable foundation, mindful that his previous comments \u201ccould place my objectivity in question.\u201d But he has repeatedly declined to say whether he would recuse himself from any investigation involving Trump associates and possible links to Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election, saying he would seek the recommendations of department ethics officials and \u201cvalue them significantly\u201d in making a decision. Sessions\u2019 confirmation leaves a vacancy that will be filled by Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican. That term ends in 2018. A measure of the hostility that has permeated the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees was reflected in the rare censure of Warren after she read from a letter written by the late Coretta Scott King in opposition to Sessions\u2019 nomination to the federal bench in 1986. \u201cThe senator has impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama,\u201d said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of Warren, before the Senate voted along party lines to bar the Massachusetts senator from speaking during the remainder of the nomination debate. Sessions, who came of age in the Deep South during the darkest days of the civil rights movement, has struggled to reconcile the charged racial politics of his region with the changing national discourse that has lifted longstanding legal barriers for minorities. His career has long been shadowed by charges that he is racially insensitive, which doomed his bid to become a federal judge. His supporters have pointed to his prosecution as U.S. Attorney of two Ku Klux Klan members for killing a black youth, and his co-sponsoring of legislation to honor civil rights activist Rosa Parks with the Congressional Gold Medal. To underscore the point, Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) on Tuesday went to the floor and put on display an enlarged photograph of a \u201cgovernmental award of excellence\u201d given to Sessions in 2009 by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People\u2019s Alabama chapter--an award that he said Sessions \u201cforgot to tell us about.\u201d The plaque was engraved with the words \u201cfor the outstanding work you do.\u201d Said Graham: \u201cHis biggest crime is, I think, that he\u2019s very conservative. That to me is not a disqualifier, any more than being liberal is a disqualifier.\u201d McConnell on Wednesday said, \u201cIt\u2019s been tough to watch all this good man has been put through in recent weeks. This is a well-qualified colleague with a deep reverence for the law. He believes strongly in the equal application of it to everyone.\u201d But Sessions\u2019 critics point to his record on voting rights, same-sex marriage, gender equality and immigration and say they fear he will work to restrict civil rights. They point to his prosecution of voting rights activists in Alabama in the 1980s that resulted in an acquittal for all three defendants, and which was the basis of King\u2019s letter charging him with attempting to \u201cintimidate and frighten elderly black voters.\u201d He has voted at least twice against comprehensive immigration reform, which was supported by members of his own party. They note he was one of just four senators in 2015 to oppose a Senate resolution affirming that the United States \u201cmust not bar individuals from entering into the United States based on their religion.\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said on the floor that her office had received 114,000 calls and emails regarding Sessions, with more than 98 percent opposed. She quoted from constitutents who \u201cdeeply oppose this president and this nominee\u201d and have hit the streets in protest. One doctor, she said, \u201cmarched because of the thousands of patients I\u2019ve seen in the community, people of color, immigrants from all over the globe, who are terrified about the loss of their rights and the dramatic explosion of racially and culturally-focused hate crimes we\u2019re reading about.\u201d She questioned how Sessions would handle the government\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the election, which could lead to the prosecution of individuals who helped hack the Democratic party in an effort to help Trump win. \u201cIt obviously has the potential to create embarrassment for the president and his people, and to implicate people involved in the campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cCan [Sessions] be independent of the White House?

Content: There has been a lot of chatter about the remarkable degree of condemnation across ideological lines of the failure of a Staten Island grand jury to indict the officer who killed Eric Garner in a forbidden choke-hold. In that context, it will be particularly interesting to see how Republican lawmakers react to the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights investigation into the killing. Some Senate Republicans are now saying that the investigation will become the subject of a line of questioning for Obama\u2019s nominee to be the next Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, who is overseeing the probe. Senator John Cornyn, who is on the Judiciary Committee that will hear Lynch\u2019s confirmation hearing, made a noteworthy statement to that effect: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico At the same time, though, another Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Jeff Sessions, appears to support the Justice Department\u2019s authority to conduct the probe, and may not make it an issue at a confirmation hearing: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee is Chuck Grassley. His office didn\u2019t return an email for comment about Cornyn\u2019s suggestion. Tracking the Republican response to this probe will help shed light on whether there are genuine prospects for bipartisan cooperation on the larger issues that have been raised by the Garner and other killings. After the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, hopes rose for bipartisan action against the problem of police over-militarization, an area where there is already some agreement between the civil liberties left and the libertarian right, and beyond that, drug law sentencing and criminal justice reform, another area of left-right overlap. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico One Democrat points out that Grassley, Sessions, and Cornyn \u2014 all of whom will play a big role in Lynch\u2019s confirmation hearings \u2014 were out front _in opposition_ to bipartisan reforms that would have reduced the sentences of many low level drug offenders, arguing they were soft on crime. That perhaps doesn\u2019t bode well for the Garner killing to help spur bipartisan agreement on broader reforms, particularly among the Senate GOP old guard. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico On this score, Senator Rand Paul could play an interesting role. After the Ferguson shooting, he came out with a remarkable statement in support of action against police militarization, and even acknowledged that it is understandable that African Americans see racial disparities in the criminal justice system. But Paul\u2019s response also demonstrated lingering disagreements among civil liberties progressives and libertarian conservatives over how deeply the inequities of our criminal justice system are rooted in longstanding racial inequality. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And when Democrats, in a bit of clever trolling, invited Paul to join them in supporting a federal probe into the broader civil rights and racial profiling ramifications of the shooting, he did not, to my knowledge, respond. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A Paul spokesman confirms to me that he has not yet taken a position on the Justice Department\u2019s probe into the Garner killing. All of this will be particularly interesting to track once the Lynch confirmation hearings \u2014 and the federal investigation of the Staten Island killing \u2014 get under way.

The majority Republicans could have put the brakes on President Trump and forced the rewriting of his travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. They chose not to. The sloppily executed travel ban, produced under the auspices of attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, has been blocked in part by federal judges, while the acting attorney general, doubting the order\u2019s legality, said she would not defend it. Trump aides reacted with conflicting signals of whether they would honor the court orders and by firing the acting attorney general \u2014 Trump\u2019s own version of Richard Nixon\u2019s Saturday Night Massacre, after just 10 days on the job. Many Republican lawmakers voiced their objections. But given a chance to do something about the offending order, they demurred. The Senate Judiciary Committee met Tuesday morning to vote on the Sessions nomination \u2014 a perfect leverage point to force Trump to revise or withdraw the order. Not one of the Republicans made a peep. One of those on the panel, Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), had called the order \u201cunacceptable\u201d as written. But Flake said nothing of that Tuesday morning in his brief statement calling Sessions \u201ca good man.\u201d Another on the panel, Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), had said in a joint statement with John McCain (R-Ariz.) that the \u201corder was not properly vetted\u201d and that \u201cwe should not turn our backs\u201d on blameless refugees, mostly women and children, who \u201csuffered unspeakable horrors.\u201d But on Tuesday, Graham \u201centhusiastically\u201d saluted the man behind the order. Also on the committee: Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who called the order \u201ctoo broad\u201d and cautioned that it could help terrorist recruiters. Sasse didn\u2019t speak at Tuesday\u2019s meeting. It\u2019s commendable that many Republicans have spoken out against Trump\u2019s travel ban. But the disconnect between what they say and what they do was particularly pronounced Tuesday morning. As The Post\u2019s Philip Rucker and Robert Costa reported, Sessions has been the \u201cintellectual godfather\u201d of Trump\u2019s policies, including the travel restrictions. Key Trump aides Stephen Miller, Rick Dearborn and Stephen K. Bannon have strong ties to Sessions, and Bannon called Sessions \u201cthe clearinghouse for policy.\u201d Roger Stone, a Trump confidant, described Sessions as Trump\u2019s John Mitchell \u2014 the Nixon attorney general who wound up in prison after an earlier constitutional crisis. It\u2019s not much of an exaggeration to describe the current situation as a constitutional crisis \u2014 except in this instance, those in the legislative branch have quickly surrendered the Article I authorities given them in the Constitution. There\u2019s a strong case that Trump\u2019s unilateral action violates federal law, and the cavalier treatment of court orders is worrisome regardless of the outcome. But Senate Republicans have twice blocked attempts by the Democrats to rescind the order \u2014 swallowing their own misgivings along the way. Back in December 2015, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), asked about Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim ban, said, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to follow that suggestion.\u201d He called the proposal \u201ccompletely and totally inconsistent with American values.\u201d Six months later, he was still arguing that \u201ca kind of broad ban is a bad idea.\u201d Now Trump is doing just such a ban in the affected countries, a Muslim ban in all but name, and McConnell is punting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be decided in the courts as to whether or not this has gone too far.\u201d Democrats delayed action on three of Trump\u2019s nominees Tuesday to protest the executive\u2019s caprice, but ultimately only the majority GOP can stop Trump. And the Republicans will never have more bargaining power than they have now, with several of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees unconfirmed. Democrats forced a one-day delay in the vote on Sessions with long-winded speeches on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThis is an administration that needed only one week to find itself on the losing side of an argument in federal court,\u201d Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) said. \u201cNever, ever seen anything like that.\u201d Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) tied the Muslim ban to the internment of U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during World War II, and she praised Republicans such as Sasse, Flake, Graham and Orrin G. Hatch (Utah) for their critical statements. But what about actions? Hatch had previously encouraged Trump to \u201cmove quickly to tailor its policy . . . as narrowly as possible.\u201d But he didn\u2019t press the point Tuesday, instead calling Sessions\u2019s qualifications \u201cunmatched in American history.\u201d Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) had cautioned about the need to remain \u201ca welcoming nation.\u201d But on Tuesday he concentrated on Sessions\u2019s \u201cintegrity.\u201d Mike Lee (R-Utah), also on the panel, had previously raised \u201cquestions\u201d about Trump\u2019s order. But he had no questions Tuesday. Lee praised Sessions\u2019s \u201cdeep commitment to the notion\u201d that \u201claws govern us rather than the will and whim of individual humans.\u201d That was the notion, anyway \u2014 until 10 days ago. **_Twitter: @Milbank_ ** _Read more fromDana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ **Read more on this topic:** Dana Milbank: Republicans are alarmed to discover Trump is doing exactly what he said he would Catherine Rampell: If there were ever a red line for Republicans, Trump crossed it Friday.

Sunday night, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick\u2019s tactic seemed to be working. The House passed a measure that would prohibit transgender students in public and charter schools from using a bathroom that matches their gender identity. Though the legislation is much narrower, it drew comparisons to the contentious North Carolina bill that spurred boycotts and protests, marring the state\u2019s image and ultimately forcing at least the appearance of a retreat. And that\u2019s not all Texas lawmakers did Sunday night. The Senate voted to advance another bill decried by LGBT advocates as discriminatory, a measure that would allow publicly funded foster care providers and adoption agencies to refuse to place children with non-Christian, unmarried or gay parents because of religious objections. It was a frenzied night for Texas Democrats and civil rights groups, who fiercely protested both measures across social media into the early hours of the morning. Equality Texas shared a tweet from one critic who summed up the day in one post: \u201cLet\u2019s just call today discrimination Sunday.\u201d House Republicans advanced the hotly debated \u201cbathroom bill\u201d as an amendment tacked on to a broader, otherwise unrelated public school bill regarding emergency operations plans. The proposal would require a transgender student who \u201cdoes not wish\u201d to use a facility based on \u201cbiological sex\u201d to use single-occupancy restrooms, locker rooms and changing facilities at their schools. It would override policies at some of the state\u2019s school districts that already allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. During Sunday night\u2019s emotional debate, Republican lawmakers said the measure was not intended to discriminate against transgender students but rather to protect the privacy and safety of all students. That\u2019s the same argument that was used by North Carolina and other backers of bathroom and locker room restrictions and rejected by President Obama\u2019s administration, which took aggressive steps to force recalcitrant states into letting transgender students use the facilities of their choice. Democrats called the bill \u201cshameful\u201d and compared it to Jim Crow-era laws that established separate but equal facilities. \u201cWhite. Colored. I was living through that era \u2026 bathrooms divided us then, and it divides us now,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Senfronia Thompson of Houston, a black woman who has served in the House since 1972. \u201cAmerica has long recognized that separate but equal is not equal at all.\u201d The amendment passed 91-50 but still needs final approval by the House, expected as soon as Monday. The amended bill would then be sent to the Senate, where it is expected to sail through easily before being sent to the governor. The last day of the legislative session is May 29. A broader measure that passed easily through the Texas Senate months ago would have barred transgender people from using public restrooms in all government buildings, public schools and colleges and universities. But that proposal went nowhere in the House. A hefty push from Lt. Gov. Patrick (R) made the difference Sunday. While most lieutenant governors around the country have little formal power, Texas\u2019 second-in-command is head of the senate and of the State Budget Board, exercising considerable sway over spending issues and crucial questions of legislative timing, such as when and if bills come to the Senate floor. While the lieutenant governor does not have the authority to call a special session, he can force the governor into calling one by delaying enactment of the state budget past the end of the legislature\u2019s regular session on May 29, which was exactly what he was threatening to do. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has said he wants to sign a bathroom bill into law. House Speaker Joe Straus, a Republican from San Antonio, had firmly opposed the broader bill. that applied to all government buildings, saying it could damage Texas\u2019 economy by provoking boycotts similar to those that hit North Carolina. But after the amended bill limited to schools passed the house Sunday, Straus spoke approvingly of it, saying the measure will \u201callow schools to continue to handle sensitive issues as they have been handling them.\u201d Nothing in federal law explicitly protects the rights of transgender people to use facilities according to their gender identity. The Supreme Court was set to consider whether the law offered some implicit guarantee but after government\u2019s position on transgender student rights changed, the court decided to pass on the subject. It had previously agreed to review the case of Gavin Grimm, a transgender teenager from Virginia fighting for the right to use the boys\u2019 bathroom at his high school. The high court remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, leaving parents of transgender students without the answers they had sought. In late March, North Carolina lawmakers repealed that state\u2019s \u201cbathroom law\u201d in the face of economic pressure in the form of boycotts, including one by the NCAA. In Texas, Rep. Chris Paddie, a Republican from Marshall, sponsored the amendment, calling it an effort to provide \u201cdefinitive guidance\u201d to school districts in regard to restrooms, locker rooms and changing facility safety for \u201call kids.\u201d He said there was \u201cabsolutely no intent\u201d to discriminate, saying the measure makes sure there are \u201creasonable accommodations for all children\u201d who might want to use a single-stall restroom. \u201cThat could be because you\u2019re transgender, that could be because you\u2019re shy,\u201d Paddie said. \u201cMaybe that child, boy or girl, is a victim of bullying.\u201d Rep. Joe Moody, a Democrat from El Paso, was among those who took issue. \u201d \u2026 The bathroom bill is an attack on transgender people,\u201d Moody said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t want to admit that because they are ashamed, and this is shameful.\u201d The Texas Association of School Boards voiced its approval of the measure, calling it a \u201ccommon-sense solution.\u201d \u201cThe language captures in law a solution many districts already use locally, seeking a balance between ensuring privacy and security for all students and respecting the dignity of all students,\u201d the Texas Association of School Boards said in a statement. The Human Rights Campaign urged the state to halt the measure, saying in a statement, \u201cpolicies such as this one, which make classifications on the basis of \u2018biological sex,\u2019 are designed to alienate transgender students from their peers.\u201d \u201cThis shameful amendment is yet another example of Texas lawmakers\u2019 anti-LGBTQ agenda,\u201d said JoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs for the group. \u201cTransgender youth deserve the same dignity and respect as their peers, and this craven attempt to use children as a pawn for cheap political points is disturbing and unconscionable.\u201d Rep. Jason Villalba, a Republican from Dallas, initially tweeted he would be voting against any amendment to the senate bill, saying \u201cdiscrimination is not a Texas value,\u201d and drawing praise from opponents of such a measure. But then he unexpectedly spoke in favor of the amendment during the hearing. He later defended his support on Twitter, calling the proposal an \u201canti-bullying amendment, not a bathroom bill.\u201d But Rep. Eddie Rodriguez, a Democrat, said in an interview with The Post \u201cit\u2019s not innocuous at all.\u201d He argued the measure would keep transgender schoolchildren out of the bathroom they feel most comfortable using and would single them out as different from their peers \u201cover something they can\u2019t control.\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is this doesn\u2019t address the equal protection problem,\u201d he said. \u201cGender neutral facilities period needs to be the solution.\u201d As the House debated the transgender bathroom amendment, the Senate voted on the adoption agency \u201creligious refusal\u201d bill, a measure opponents say uses taxpayer money to discriminate against LGBT people seeking to be foster or adoptive parents.

Republicans were more cautious in their remarks, but there were signs that they could step up calls for an outside investigation of the Trump team\u2019s ties to Russia as a result of the Sessions news. Right now, the probes are being handled by the House and Senate Intelligence panels, and the FBI is investigating possible Russian interference in the election and the Trump team\u2019s possible ties to Kremlin officials.

The House of Delegates voted 82 to 57 on Thursday to give transgender individuals the same protections given to those who might face discrimination based on race, sex, color, creed, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation, age or disability. The Senate has already approved the civil rights legislation, and Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley (D) said he looks forward to signing it into law. The House also approved a $39 billion state budget for the next fiscal year, including a provision that would allow the state to seize property of film production companies that receive more than $10 million in tax credits and then leave the state \u2014 as the Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d has threatened to do. The Senate has approved a similar budget but differences between the two will have to be reconciled. Lawmakers have fought over whether to pass a bill protecting transgender individuals for more than seven years. The battle culminated Thursday in an intense and often emotional debate. After the House vote, the senator and delegates who sponsored the legislation hugged on the chamber floor. \u201cPeople realized that no one should be denied a job, should be thrown out of their home, should be denied a place to eat dinner just for living a life as who they are,\u201d said Sen. Richard S. Madaleno Jr. (D-Montgomery), who has championed the protections. He is gay and is running for reelection against Dana Beyer, a transgender woman. The Fairness for All Marylanders Act of 2014 bans discrimination based on gender identity in employment, housing and public places, which includes hotels, restaurants, theaters and sports venues. It includes an exemption for religious organizations, private clubs and educational institutions. Sixteen other states and the District have enacted similar legislation. More than a dozen delegates \u2014 including some Democrats \u2014 argued against the legislation on Thursday. They called the legislation the \u201cBathroom Bill,\u201d as it would allow a person who was born male to use women\u2019s restrooms if that person identifies as female. Opponents said that practice could endanger women and girls who are using the bathroom. Supporters, however, said transgender people are often ridiculed and sometimes assaulted when they use restrooms assigned to the genders of their birth. The chamber was unruly, with some opponents of the bill cracking jokes about transgender people and Del. Neil Parrott (R-Washington) citing the Bible as he proclaimed that God made men as men and women as women. \u201cWe can pass all the bills we want, but we cannot change nature; politics cannot change nature,\u201d said Del. Emmett C. Burns Jr. (D-Baltimore County). \u201cMy constituents think we have lost our minds.\u201d Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Harford) unsuccessfully proposed an amendment that would have excluded bathroom facilities from the list of public places where discrimination is prohibited, saying, \u201cPlease protect women, protect little girls.\u201d Del. Joseline A. Pena-Melnyk (D-Prince George\u2019s), one of dozens of lawmakers who backed the bill, was tasked with responding to objections. She said she studied for weeks and practiced answers with the help of Del. Luke H. Clippinger (D-Baltimore), the lead sponsor of the original House version of the legislation. While Pena-Melnyk stayed calm through hours of sparring, some of her colleagues grew frustrated, accusing opponents of the bill of lacking tolerance. Several said the struggle of the transgender community for civil protections was comparable to past struggles of African Americans, gays and religious minorities. They did not come close to persuading Del. Kevin Kelly (D-Allegany), who said that if he saw a person whom he thought to be a man follow his 7-year-old daughter into \u201cthe little ladies\u2019 room\u201d at a restaurant, he would confront that person.

Comey on Tuesday, at the recommendation of senior Justice Department officials who said he had treated Hillary Clinton unfairly and in doing so damaged the credibility of the FBI and the Justice Department. The startling development comes as Comey was leading a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether associates of Trump may have coordinated with Russia to interfere with the U.S. presidential election last year. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Comey\u2019s ouster will affect the Russia probe, but Democrats said they were concerned that his ouster could derail the investigation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Comey\u2019s deputy, Andrew McCabe, would be the acting director of the FBI. As a presidential candidate, Trump explicitly criticized Comey and McCabe for their roles in the Clinton probe while at other points praising Comey for his \u201cguts.\u201d \u201cThe president has accepted the recommendation of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general regarding the dismissal of the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters in the White House briefing room. The firing is effective \u201cimmediately,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Trump shot back at Democrats outraged by Comey\u2019s firing, but did not give further details on the White House decision. \u201cThe Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\u201d Trump wrote in a Twitter post. In a separate tweet, Trump said Comey had \u201clost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike.\u201d \u201cWhen things calm down, they will be thanking me!\u201d Trump wrote. Trump also defended his action by claiming Comey would be \u201creplaced by someone who will do a far better job\u201d and restore \u201cthe spirit and prestige of the FBI.\u201d Comey was in Los Angeles on Tuesday on a recruiting trip. Officials said Comey was fired because senior Justice Department officials concluded that he had violated Justice Department principles and procedures last year by publicly discussing the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Democrats have long argued that Comey\u2019s decisions in the months and days before the election hurt Clinton\u2019s standing with voters and affected the outcome, but the president and his closest advisers had argued that Comey went too easy on Clinton and her aides. Just last week, Trump publicly accused Comey of giving Clinton \u201ca free pass for many bad deeds\u2019\u2019 when he decided not to recommend criminal charges in the case. Officials released a Tuesday memo from the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, laying out the rationale behind Comey\u2019s dismissal and attributing it all to his handling of the Clinton case. Officials said Rosenstein began examining Comey\u2019s conduct shortly after being sworn into office two weeks ago. \u201cThe FBI\u2019s reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice,\u201d Rosenstein wrote. \u201cI cannot defend the director\u2019s handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.\u201d But Democrats immediately linked the dismissal to the Russia probe. \u201cThe decision by a President whose campaign associates are under investigation by the FBI for collusion with Russia to fire the man overseeing that investigation, upon the recommendation of an Attorney General who has recused himself from that investigation, raises profound questions about whether the White House is brazenly interfering in a criminal matter,\u201d Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. The House committee is looking into Russian interference in the election. Some Republicans were also concerned. \u201cI am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey\u2019s termination,\u201d said Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also examining Russian meddling. \u201cI have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee.\u201d There were multiple calls by Democrats on Tuesday night for the appointment of a special prosecutor to lead the Russia investigation and take the matter out of the hands of Justice Department leadership. In an attempt to pressure Republicans to join calls for an independent prosecutor, Senate Democrats have been asked by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to be in the Senate chamber at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday when the legislative day begins. In a late-night tweet Tuesday, Trump targeted Schumer. \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer stated recently, \u201cI do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.\u201d Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp,\u201d the president wrote. Trump plans to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday. It will be the first face-to-face contact between the president and a senior official of the Russian government. Rosenstein wrote in the memo that when Comey announced on July 5 that he had decided not to recommend charges in the Clinton case, he did so \u201cwithout the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders. Compounding the error, the director ignored another long-standing principle: we do not hold news conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation . . . we never release it gratuitously . . . It is a textbook example of what federal prosecutors and agents are taught not to do.\u201d Rosenstein was also critical of Comey\u2019s decision to reveal in late October that the Clinton email probe had resumed, and he dismissed the FBI director\u2019s recent defense to Congress that not doing so would have effectively been to \u201cconceal\u201d important information. \u201c \u2018Conceal\u2019 is a loaded term that misstates the issue,\u201d Rosenstein wrote. \u201cWhen federal agents and prosecutors quietly open a criminal investigation, we are not concealing anything; we are simply following the long-standing policy that we refrain from publicizing non-public information. In that context, silence is not concealment.\u201d In a letter to Trump, Sessions said that he agreed Comey had to go. \u201cI have concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI,\u2019\u2019 Sessions wrote. \u201cI must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr. and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI.\u2019\u2019 But in October \u2014 when Sessions was a senator supporting Trump, and Comey revealed less than two weeks before the election that he had reopened the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server \u2014 Sessions applauded the decision in an appearance on Fox Business Network. \u201cHe had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days or not, to come forward with the new information that he has and let the American people know that, too,\u201d Sessions said at the time. Nothing in the Rosenstein memo suggests that the Clinton investigation will be reopened. Tuesday afternoon, White House aide Keith Schiller, who has long served Trump as a bodyguard, visited FBI headquarters to hand-deliver Trump\u2019s dismissal letter to Comey\u2019s office, although the director wasn\u2019t there to receive it, officials said. Trump wrote to Comey: \u201cYou are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.\u2019\u2019 The president added: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.\u2019\u2019 Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Spicer said he did not know what the three occasions were when Comey told Trump that he wasn\u2019t under investigation. Spicer also rejected calls for a special prosecutor. \u201cSpecial prosecutor, for what? On multiple occasions, they said that the president wasn\u2019t under investigation. What are we investigating?\u201d he said. The news of Comey\u2019s firing stunned Washington. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Comey\u2019s decisions \u201chave called into question the trust and political independence of the FBI.\u2019\u2019 The senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (Mich.), however, compared Tuesday\u2019s developments to the Watergate scandal and said the actions \u201creek of a coverup and appear to be part of an ongoing effort by the Trump White House to impede the investigation into Russian ties and interference in our elections.\u2019\u2019 Over the past two years, Comey had assumed an extraordinary role in Washington \u2014 overseeing not one, but two investigations involving presidential candidates. In some ways, that made him more powerful than the Justice Department officials to whom he reported. After Clinton lost to Trump, many Democrats blamed Comey for what they viewed as his unprecedented interference in the election process, but most later came to see him as an independent figure in the Trump administration who would be critical to a fair and thorough investigation of any possible ties between Russia and Trump associates. Several current and former officials said the relationship between the White House and the FBI had been strained for months, in part because administration officials were pressuring Comey to more aggressively pursue leak investigations over disclosures that embarrassed the White House and raised questions about ties with Russia. That pressure was described as conversational challenges to FBI leadership to pursue the source of leaks seen as damaging to the administration, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Although the FBI is investigating disclosures of classified information, the bureau has resisted calls to prioritize leak investigations over the Russia matter, or probe matters that did not involve leaks of classified or otherwise sensitive information, the officials said. \u201cThe administration has been putting pressure on the FBI to focus more on the leaks and weren\u2019t satisfied with the results,\u2019\u2019 said a former senior U.S. official familiar with the matter. A current official said administration figures have been \u201cvery aggressive\u2019\u2019 in pressuring the FBI. The Justice Department inspector general has been investigating how Comey and his top deputy handled the Clinton probe, though that investigation is expected to continue for months. Shortly before the announcement, the FBI notified Congress by letter that Comey had misstated key findings involving the Clinton email investigation during testimony last week, but nothing about that issue suggested it might imperil Comey\u2019s job.

But British police said that Assange still faces arrest for jumping bail if he walks out of diplomatic protection, which he claims is needed to keep him from being extradited to the United States to face charges of disclosing confidential military and diplomatic documents. The Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement that Sweden\u2019s director of public prosecution, Marianne Ny, \u201ctoday decided to discontinue the investigation\u201d into a rape claim against Assange. Assange has disputed the rape allegation. He also argued that he risked being extradited by Sweden to the United States and tried for espionage. He took refuge in the embassy in 2012. Assange\u2019s lawyer, Per Samuelson, said in an emailed statement that Assange had \u201cproved his innocence.\u201d The case was closed, he wrote, \u201cbecause an innocent man proved he was not guilty!\u201d But Swedish officials said the decision only drops the case and is not a ruling on Assange\u2019s guilt or innocence. The attorney for Assange\u2019s accuser said it was a \u201cscandal\u201d that the case was not tried in court. \u201cMy client is shocked, and no closure decision can get her to change that Assange has exposed her to a rape,\u201d said the attorney, Elisabeth Massi Fritz. WikiLeaks said the focus would now shift to Britain. \u201cU.K. refuses to confirm or deny whether it has already received a U.S. extradition warrant for Julian Assange,\u201d the anti-secrecy organization tweeted. The silver-haired activist made a rare appearance on the balcony of the embassy late Friday afternoon with a clenched fist in the air. \u201cToday is an important victory,\u201d he told the throng of journalists camped outside the embassy, a stone\u2019s throw from the Harrods department store. He said that a \u201clegal conflict\u201d with the United States and Britain was continuing, and that a \u201cproper war was just commencing.\u201d \u201cSeven years without charge, while my children grew up without me. That is not something I can forgive. It is not something that I can forget,\u201d he said. The London Metropolitan Police made it clear in a statement that there remains an outstanding arrest warrant for Assange: \u201cWestminster Magistrates\u2019 Court issued a warrant for the arrest of Julian Assange following him failing to surrender to the court on the 29 June 2012. The Metropolitan Police Service is obliged to execute that warrant should he leave the Embassy.\u201d The maximum penalty for breaching bail is up to a year in prison or a fine. The police also recognized that Assange is now \u201cwanted for a much less serious offense\u201d and said they would \u201cprovide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offense.\u201d It remains unclear whether there is a standing U.S. extradition order for Assange. The policy of Britain\u2019s Home Office is to neither confirm nor deny extradition orders until a person has been arrested in relation to an order. Last month, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was stepping up efforts to arrest Assange as part of a broader fight against those who leak secrets into the public domain. President Trump was highly supportive of WikiLeaks during his campaign for office in 2016, when the website released hacked emails from the account of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chief, John Podesta. Trump once told a rally: \u201cWe love WikiLeaks. They revealed a lot.\u201d But when the Associated Press asked Trump last month about making the arrest of Assange a priority, the president said, \u201cI am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it\u2019s okay with me.\u201d In 2015, British police ended a multimillion-pound policing operation that included round-the-clock guarding of the Ecuadoran compound. But they also said that they would beef up their \u201ccovert tactics\u201d and that Assange would be arrested if he left the embassy. In explaining why Sweden was dropping the investigation, Ny told a news conference in Stockholm that \u201call possibilities to advance the investigation have now been exhausted\u201d and that the legal proceedings could continue only if Assange were present in Sweden. But she said that if Assange returns to Sweden before the statute of limitations lapses in 2020, an investigation could be reopened.", "qid": 870, "docid": "c2059d6a-3c79-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69", "score": 10.185199737548828}, {"content": "Title: Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of special counsel serves as olive branch on eve of Senate appearance Content: Deputy Attorney General Rod J.

Barely three weeks after a resounding 94-to-6 confirmation vote, Rosenstein\u2019s previously stellar reputation as a prosecutor\u2019s prosecutor had been thrown into question amid the fallout of President Trump\u2019s abrupt firing last week of James B. Comey as FBI director. Democrats had gone from voicing cautious optimism to some calling for his resignation after Trump\u2019s allies cited a Rosenstein memo as the reason for Comey\u2019s dismissal. Democrats mocked the quality of Rosenstein\u2019s writing and research. They noted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s recusal from the investigation left Rosenstein as the man holding the power to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the Russia case, and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) convened an early Wednesday afternoon huddle of Democrats to plot strategy about how to force Rosenstein\u2019s hand. \u201cRosenstein\u2019s credibility is on a very shaky foundation with many of my colleagues. He needs to be forthright, thorough, responsive to have any hope of restoring the confidence of many of my Democratic colleagues,\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who enthusiastically voted to confirm Rosenstein April 25, said Wednesday. At 6 p.m. Wednesday, Rosenstein gave into those demands and appointed Robert S. Mueller III, the FBI director for 12 years before Comey, as the special counsel to conduct the investigation into Russian meddling and any ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Mueller, who became FBI director a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, guided the bureau into a wartime footing focused on protecting the homeland. In 2011, President Barack Obama asked for and received a 100-to-0 vote to grant a two-year extension of the usual 10-year term granted to FBI directors. Democrats were quick to applaud Rosenstein\u2019s appointment of Mueller, who became a close ally of Comey\u2019s while he served as deputy attorney general in 2003 and 2004. In one dramatic standoff, Mueller, Comey and other senior Justice Department officials threatened to resign en masse over a dispute related to warrantless wiretapping. But Rosenstein will still face tough questions from Democrats and Republicans who want to understand the timeline of events over the past nine days. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a chance to ask him about the scope of Sessions recusal, about the Comey firing, about his memo,\u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said before the Mueller announcement. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said he wants to know if Rosenstein had seen or heard about Comey\u2019s interactions with the president \u2014 which have come to light in notes that the FBI director filed away after each meeting \u2014 before Rosenstein wrote his analysis of Comey\u2019s FBI tenure that was released upon his dismissal. \u201cObviously people are going to want to know if he got that memo before he wrote his memo, if he got his Comey memo before he wrote his Comey memo. That\u2019s the big question,\u201d Flake said. The Mueller appointment was greeted with a deep sigh of relief among Republicans. Each day, with each new revelation, more Republicans came closer to calling for a special counsel but usually with a caveat of \u201cmaybe\u201d the time had come for such a step. They were hesitant to call for such an investigation of a president from their own party, but they were weary from being on the defensive as Trump allegations mounted. Now, with such a respected appointee overseeing the investigation, Republicans have a ready-made defense to shield themselves from inquiries: Bob Mueller is going to get to the bottom of this. Wednesday evening marked the third straight on Capitol Hill where late-breaking news caused whiplash as lawmakers came to the chamber to vote. On Monday, it was The Washington Post\u2019s report that Trump, in an Oval Office meeting last week, provided to Russian diplomats highly classified information gleaned from a then-undisclosed ally about the Islamic State. On Tuesday, it was the New York Times report that in mid-February, after Trump was forced to dismiss his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, over lying to superiors about his contacts with Russia, the president pulled Comey aside and asked him to \u201clet it go\u201d regarding the ongoing investigation of Flynn. That report sent senators into a frenzy during Tuesday\u2019s round of votes, when they could be seen anxiously chatting among themselves. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) saw them too \u2014 and realized she had missed out on something. \u201cWhat now?\u201d she screamed across the chamber. McCaskill walked over and briefed Heitkamp on the latest breaking news. Regardless of the Mueller appointment, senators will want Rosenstein\u2019s assurance that all of Comey\u2019s memos about Trump will be provided to the relevant committees overseeing investigations. \u201cI want to see the evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just read about it. I want to see it.\u201d Rosenstein\u2019s shaky standing is a stunning turnaround. In 2005 President George W. Bush nominated him to be U.S. attorney for Maryland. He won such high praise that the state\u2019s Democrats convinced Obama to keep him on in 2009. During his confirmation hearing, Rosenstein promised to be an independent voice in considering such a move. \u201cI would evaluate the facts and the law [and] consider the applicable law,\u201d he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. But two weeks after Rosenstein\u2019s confirmation, Trump dismissed Comey. His aides cited Rosenstein\u2019s memo as the reason for his firing \u2014 until Trump himself cited the \u201cRussia thing\u201d in an NBC News interview two days later. Rosenstein\u2019s previous supporters now question whether they ever should have supported him. \u201cI have real questions about his judgment,\u201d Coons said, \u201cgiven the memo, the memo that was cited as the reason for the firing FBI Director Jim Comey, and the subsequent shifting White House justification for why the FBI director was fired needs to be more thoroughly explained.\u201d His appointment of Mueller is the first step to winning back their trust. _Read more fromPaul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ ****", "qid": 870, "docid": "eb182dc8-3b23-11e7-8854-21f359183e8c", "score": 10.162199974060059}, {"content": "Title: Joe Manchin\u2019s balancing act on full display during Sessions controversy Content: Thursday\u2019s news cycle, which put Attorney General Jeff Sessions through the wringer, could have also been tough for Sen.

Generally seen to be the most at-risk of the Democrats up for reelection next year, Manchin has voted for most of President Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees \u2014 and he was the one Democrat who voted to confirm Sessions. And early in the morning, progressive protesters rallied at the office of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) to demand that Manchin be removed from his post-election leadership role in the party. But on an extraordinarily busy day, Manchin seemed to skate by. The quick sequence of events demonstrates how he did so. The progressive protest didn\u2019t attract much media attention, and Manchin\u2019s effort to establish relationships with Breitbart reporters \u2014 a focus of the protest \u2014 gave him favorable coverage on the right. \u201cNot only did Senator Manchin vote for the president\u2019s unqualified nominees,\u201d says WeWillReplaceYou co-founder Yong Jung Cho, \u201cbut he joined Republicans in voting against necessary environmental protections for vulnerable West Virginians.\u201d \u201cI voted for him because I did trust him, absolutely,\u201d Manchin says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said, point blank, when it came out about the Mike Flynn investigation, I called Jeff and said, \u2018Jeff, you should recuse yourself \u2014 get the heck out of the way!\u2019 And he said he would take the matter into consideration.

By noon, few people were aware of the protest; readers of mainstream news sites thought that Manchin had become a Sessions critic; and readers of Breitbart believed that he had refused to join the anti-Sessions mob.

His treatment of Sessions is different. Content: Sen. John Cornyn counts Attorney General Jeff Sessions as one of his best friends in Washington, and their wives are even closer, making the couples regular double-date partners. \u201cWe occasionally get together to break bread,\u201d the Senate majority whip said Wednesday. One of those double dates came recently enough that Cornyn (R-Tex.) and Sessions could not avoid the elephant in the room: President Trump\u2019s public taunting of his attorney general, in a manner that suggests he wants Sessions to resign. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk in any great detail about this, but obviously it\u2019s in the news,\u201d Cornyn said, reiterating his strong support of Sessions remaining in office. Cornyn is not alone in rallying to the defense of Sessions, who, despite sometimes having waged lonely battles as one of the chamber\u2019s most staunch conservatives, still has many friends among Senate Republicans. Most have issued statements of support, and several are making private calls to reassure Sessions that they are behind him. But the tension over Trump\u2019s treatment of Sessions goes beyond the senators defending a friend. Unlike any other controversial move that Trump has pondered in his six months as president, Senate Republicans are sending preemptive signals that firing the attorney general or pressuring him to resign would be a terrible move. Some have warned high-level White House officials that it would look as though Trump were making the move solely to shut down an investigation of his campaign and the White House, now overseen by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, while also making clear that they agree with Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from an investigation of the Trump campaign\u2019s connections to Russia. Replacing Sessions would be difficult, and the idea of Trump making a recess appointment during the planned four-week break in August is foolhardy. Democrats can indefinitely stall a resolution to fully adjourn the Senate, having already forced minute-long periods during even shorter breaks to prevent Trump from having the authority to make temporary appointments while the Senate is away. Democrats may have vehemently opposed Sessions\u2019s nomination, but they have no intention of allowing Trump to fire him and name a new attorney general with a recess appointment, and frankly, Republicans do not seem to want to give Trump that power either. Beyond concerns about the controversy that firing Sessions would bring, Senate Republicans say, Trump\u2019s behavior is unseemly toward someone they respect, given that Sessions went out on a limb for the first-time candidate, becoming the first senator to endorse Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI think Sessions deserves to be treated much more fairly. I mean, Jeff was there when no other senator was,\u201d said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (Utah), the longest currently serving Republican in the Senate. Hatch spoke to Sessions last Thursday to declare his support, a message he conveyed to White House officials, and Hatch is trying to set up a call to Trump to deliver the same message. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear in a brief interview Wednesday that his backing of Sessions has gone up the chain of command. Asked if he told Trump of his support, McConnell smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve conveyed that to the public and to others,\u201d he said. The support for Sessions runs deep across the Republican Party. Former senator Jim DeMint (S.C.), a conservative renegade who often clashed with McConnell, praised the attorney general Wednesday during a visit to the Capitol. \u201cOne of the best guys I ever worked with,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope he and the president can work it out.\u201d The question, however, is how Senate Republicans will respond if Trump does force their friend out of the Justice Department \u2014 a move that might be followed by firing Mueller, setting off another crisis at least as big as the ouster of James B. Comey as FBI director in May. Would there be any ramification beyond just expressing dismay? That remains to be seen, but some are warning that the fallout would be devastating to the rest of Trump\u2019s agenda. \u201cI think Jeff Sessions is doing a good job, and I think it would be in\u00adcred\u00adibly disruptive and make it more difficult for the president to accomplish his agenda,\u201d Cornyn told CNN early Wednesday. By lunchtime, Cornyn declined to say what the ramifications would be, instead focusing on the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Sessions had served as an adviser to the Trump campaign, a high-profile surrogate who would travel with him and often introduce him at rallies. He also got caught up in a controversy by not fully revealing during his confirmation process all of his contacts with Russian officials. That made it a by-the-book call to recuse, delegating the investigation to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who then appointed Mueller shortly after he was involved in the Comey firing \u2014 which is now its own piece of the Mueller inquiry. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine any future nominee would have decided the recusal issue any differently from Jeff Sessions,\u201d Cornyn said. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), who was elected along with Sessions in 1996, became visibly angry when discussing Trump\u2019s treatment of his former colleague. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, it\u2019s disconcerting, it\u2019s inexplicable,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you have to tweet with regards to your feelings about people in your own Cabinet.\u201d One fallout from Trump\u2019s treatment of Sessions could be to guarantee that no Senate Republican will again be willing to give up a seat to accept a job with Trump. \u201cThere are some well-qualified individuals, who otherwise would be inclined to serve, who might be discouraged from doing so given the rift that he has had with one of his most loyal supporters,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a moderate who became friends with Sessions as part of the 1996 class. After Comey was fired, Sessions led the recruiting effort to get Cornyn the nomination to run the FBI. Their wives talked about the idea and Cornyn warmed to it, before other Republicans signaled that he would be too political a choice to run the independent investigative body. Now, their double dates take on a different tone when they discuss working for Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fine,\u201d Cornyn said of Sessions. \u201cHe did the right thing, and I think he has the confidence that he did the right thing.\u201d _Read more fromPaul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook._ **** Republicans close ranks around Trump during Comey testimony Echoes of 1973: One longtime Republican lawmaker recalls the challenge of bucking his own party\u2019s president", "qid": 870, "docid": "f3b00a6a-722c-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304", "score": 10.151700019836426}, {"content": "Title: Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later did not disclose Content: Then-Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) spoke twice last year with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump\u2019s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions\u2019s confirmation hearing to become attorney general. One of the meetings was a private conversation between Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that took place in September in the senator\u2019s office, at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race. The previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s alleged role in the 2016 presidential election. As attorney general, Sessions oversees the Justice Department and the FBI, which have been leading investigations into Russian meddling and any links to Trump\u2019s associates. He has so far resisted calls to recuse himself. When Sessions spoke with Kislyak in July and September, the senator was a senior member of the influential Armed Services Committee as well as one of Trump\u2019s top foreign policy advisers. Sessions played a prominent role supporting Trump on the stump after formally joining the campaign in February 2016. At his Jan. 10 Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, Sessions was asked by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) what he would do if he learned of any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of the 2016 campaign. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any of those activities,\u201d he responded. He added: \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d Officials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers\u2019 questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak. \u201cThere was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,\u201d said Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions\u2019s spokeswoman. In January, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Sessions for answers to written questions. \u201cSeveral of the President-elect\u2019s nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\u201d Leahy wrote. Sessions responded with one word: \u201cNo.\u201d In a statement issued Wednesday night, Sessions said he \u201cnever met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. I have no idea what this allegation is about. It is false.\u201d Justice officials said Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept. 8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a Trump campaign surrogate. \u201cHe was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign \u2014 not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee,\u201d Flores said. She added that Sessions last year had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian and German ambassadors, in addition to Kislyak. In the case of the September meeting, one department official who came to the defense of the attorney general said, \u201cThere\u2019s just not strong recollection of what was said.\u201d The Russian ambassador did not respond to requests for comment about his contacts with Sessions. The Washington Post contacted all 26 members of the 2016 Senate Armed Services Committee to see whether any lawmakers besides Sessions met with Kislyak in 2016. Of the 20 lawmakers who responded, every senator, including Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), said they did not meet with the Russian ambassador last year. The other lawmakers on the panel did not respond as of Wednesday evening. \u201cMembers of the committee have not been beating a path to Kislyak\u2019s door,\u201d a senior Senate Armed Services Committee staffer said, citing tensions in relations with Moscow. Besides Sessions, the staffer added, \u201cThere haven\u2019t been a ton of members who are looking to meet with Kislyak for their committee duties.\u201d Last month, The Post reported that Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions with Kislyak during the month before Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Mike Pence, the vice president- elect, and other top Trump officials. Flynn was forced to resign the following week. When asked to comment on Sessions\u2019s contacts with Kislyak, Franken said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday: \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Attorney General Sessions met with the Russian ambassador in the midst of the campaign, then I am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was, at best, misleading.\u201d Franken added: \u201cIt is now clearer than ever that the attorney general cannot, in good faith, oversee an investigation at the Department of Justice and the FBI of the Trump-Russia connection, and he must recuse himself immediately.\u201d Several Democratic members of the House on Wednesday night called on Sessions to resign from his post. \u201cAfter lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement, adding that \u201cSessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country.\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Twitter late Wednesday that \u201cwe need a special counsel to investigate Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia.\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said at a CNN town hall Wednesday night that if the substance of Sessions\u2019s conversations with the Russian ambassador proved to be improper or suspect, he too would join the call for Sessions to recuse himself from the investigation. \u201cIf there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation, it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make that decision about Trump,\u201d Graham said \u2014 although he stressed that Sessions\u2019s contacts with the Russian ambassador could have been \u201cinnocent.\u201d \u201cBut if there\u2019s something there that the FBI thinks is criminal in nature, then for sure you need a special prosecutor. If that day ever comes, I\u2019ll be the first one to say it needs to be somebody other than Jeff.\u201d Current and former U.S. officials say they see Kislyak as a diplomat, not an intelligence operative. But they were not sure to what extent, if any, Kislyak was aware of or involved in the covert Russian election campaign. Steven Hall, former head of Russia operations at the CIA, said that Russia would have been keenly interested in cultivating a relationship with Sessions because of his role on key congressional committees and as an early adviser to Trump. Sessions\u2019s membership on the Armed Services Committee would have made him a priority for the Russian ambassador. \u201cThe fact that he had already placed himself at least ideologically behind Trump would have been an added bonus for Kislyak,\u201d Hall said. Michael McFaul, a Stanford University professor who until 2014 served as U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he was not surprised that Kislyak would seek a meeting with Sessions. \u201cThe weird part is to conceal it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was at the height of all the discussions of what Russia was doing during the election.\u201d Two months before the September meeting, Sessions attended a Heritage Foundation event in July on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention that was attended by about 50 ambassadors. When the event was over, a small group of ambassadors approached Sessions as he was leaving the podium, and Kislyak was among them, the Justice Department official said. Sessions then spoke individually to some of the ambassadors, including Kislyak, the official said. In the informal exchanges, the ambassadors expressed appreciation for his remarks and some of them invited him to events they were sponsoring, said the official, citing a former Sessions staffer who was at the event. Democratic lawmakers, including senior members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have demanded in recent weeks that Sessions recuse himself from the government\u2019s inquiry into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia. Last week, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, became one of the few Republican representatives to state publicly the need for an independent investigation. Sessions\u2019s public position on Russia has evolved over time. In an interview with RealClear World on the sidelines of the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Brussels Forum in March 2015, Sessions said the United States and Europe \u201chave to unify\u201d against Russia. More than a year later, he spoke about fostering a stronger relationship with the Kremlin. In a July 2016 interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Sessions praised Trump\u2019s plan to build better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cDonald Trump is right. We need to figure out a way to end this cycle of hostility that\u2019s putting this country at risk, costing us billions of dollars in defense, and creating hostilities,\u201d Sessions told CNN. Asked whether he viewed Putin as a good or bad leader, Sessions told CNN: \u201cWe have a lot of bad leaders around the world that operate in ways we would never tolerate in the United States. But the question is, can we have a more peaceful, effective relationship with Russia? Utilizing interests that are similar in a realistic way to make this world a safer place and get off this dangerous hostility with Russia? I think it\u2019s possible.\u201d Julie Tate, Robert Costa and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.", "qid": 870, "docid": "77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f", "score": 10.139300346374512}, {"content": "Title: The attack on Jeff Sessions is part of the new McCarthyism Content: Here is what Attorney General Jeff Sessions should have said when he stepped up to the podium and addressed reporters last week at the Justice Department: \u201cAt long last, have you left no sense of decency?\u201d Sessions is the victim of the type of McCarthyite character assassination that the left used to condemn. Remember when accusing people without evidence of coordinating with the Kremlin was frowned upon? No longer, apparently. In fact, what Sessions faced may be worse than McCarthyism. At least McCarthy was right when he claimed that there were Russian spies in the State Department (see Hiss, Alger, among others). On \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this weekend, former Obama director of national intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. declared that the U.S. intelligence community he headed until a few weeks ago had found \u201cno evidence\u201d of any collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence. No evidence. The suggestion that Sessions was colluding with the Russians and tried to cover it up is preposterous. Sessions was asked during his confirmation hearings by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) about allegations contained in an unsubstantiated dossier that \u201cthere was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.\u201d Sessions replied, \u201cSenator Franken, I\u2019m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I\u2019m unable to comment on it.\u201d He was clearly referring to the allegations Franken had just cited of \u201ca continuing exchange of information\u201d between the Russians and Team Trump. His answer was truthful. He was later asked in a written question from Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.): \u201cHave you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government _about the 2016 election,_ either before or after election day?\u201d (emphasis added). Sessions answered \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 which, again, was truthful. In hindsight, he could have clarified that he had met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in his Senate office in his official capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But why would he? A host of Democratic lawmakers \u2014 including then-Sen. Mary Landrieu (La.) and Sens. Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Jack Reed (R.I.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.) \u2014 have also met with Kislyak. That\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s their job. Sessions was not asked about official meetings. Then the Wall Street Journal breathlessly reported that Sessions had in fact met with the Russian ambassador at the GOP convention. \u201cThe Trump administration says Attorney General Jeff Sessions was acting as a then-U.S. senator when he talked to Russia\u2019s ambassador at an event during last year\u2019s Republican National Convention in Cleveland,\u201d the Journal reported, \u201cbut Mr. Sessions paid for convention travel expenses out of his own political funds and he spoke about Donald Trump\u2019s campaign at the event, according to a person at the event and campaign-finance records.\u201d This could be the biggest non-story of a year. To clarify: Then-Sen. Sessions traveled to a political event \u2014 the Republican National Convention \u2014 using campaign money, not taxpayer money, as the law requires. The Russian ambassador was there as one of about 80 ambassadors participating in an official diplomatic program, coordinated with the Obama State Department. He and Sessions met at a public event where Sessions spoke. How, exactly, is this a scandal? Answer: It\u2019s not. But that has not stopped leading Democrats from calling for Sessions\u2019s resignation or leading news organizations to report on the \u201ca parade of new revelations linking the Trump campaign to Russia.\u201d Please. And is it really just pure coincidence that the Sessions story broke just after Trump delivered a widely acclaimed address to Congress? The stench of politics runs high. Sessions has recused himself from any official investigation of the Trump campaign, as he should. As a former Trump campaign official, he rightly concluded he should not be involved in any investigation of the Trump campaign to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. The Senate Intelligence Committee has launched an investigation into whether there was any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, as it should. Americans deserve a careful and dispassionate inquiry so that we can get all the facts. And if any actual evidence emerges of some sort of wrongdoing, those facts should be exposed and those responsible held to account. But if not, then it is entirely possible that Donald Trump\u2019s embrace of Vladimir Putin during the 2016 campaign is nothing more than an example of bad policy judgment (much like his embrace of Syria\u2019s murderous president, Bashar al-Assad). Embracing dictators is wrongheaded, but it is not a crime. As for the witch hunts, some in the media need to take a long, hard look in the mirror.

Content: Four months after the fact, President Trump is still frustrated that his political ally and attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that is haunting the president. But if Trump had been listening to anything Sessions said publicly about how he would handle a Russia investigation involving the president, Trump could have seen this coming. Sessions didn't explicitly promise to recuse himself from any potential FBI Russia investigation in his January confirmation hearing to oversee the Justice Department. But he did promise to seek legal counsel to avoid the conflict of interest of serving on the Trump campaign and then in the Trump administration. And that's exactly what happened. Sessions's recusal also came immediately after The Washington Post revealed that Sessions had met with the Russian ambassador during the campaign and had not disclosed it to the Senate, leading to accusations by Democrats that he was trying to hide something. Several months earlier, at Sessions's confirmation hearing, Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Sessions whether he would recuse himself from any hypothetical investigation into the Trump campaign. At the time, the FBI hadn't publicly confirmed it was investigating whether the Trump campaign helped Russia meddle in the 2016 election.

But at the time \u2014 and in retrospect \u2014 it looks as though Sessions was saying: If there were a Trump-Russia investigation, and if my impartiality were compromised (beyond being a Trump campaign adviser), I'd step away from it. That same day, Sessions had promised to senators that he would recuse himself from any Hillary Clinton email investigation on the basis that he had criticized Clinton on the campaign trail. Sessions had given an opinion on the matter and the attorney general, he said, shouldn't act \u201cin any way that would suggest anything less than political objectivity.\u201d Logic follows \u2014 and Sessions indicated \u2014 that if he did something that revealed an opinion about the president, he would recuse himself from any relevant investigations. In fact, impartial justice was the overriding theme of two days of Sessions's hearing. Senators on both sides of the aisle knew how close Sessions had become to Trump \u2014 he was one of the president's first big-league supporters and closest advisers on the campaign. Sessions set out to assuage Congress's concerns that he'd be some kind of crony for Trump, a candidate who didn't express any real regard for the rule of law during the campaign. \u201cIf a president wants to accomplish a goal that he or she believes in deeply, then you should help them do it in a lawful way,\u201d Sessions said, \u201cbut make clear and object if it's an unlawful action. That helps the president avoid difficulty. It's the ultimate loyalty to him.\u201d If we follow Sessions's public testimony, it doesn't really make sense that Trump was caught off guard by Sessions's recusal. It's clear Sessions had considered the possibility, and he promised to do what was legally and ethically correct, not politically expedient. That leaves us with two other options for why Trump is still so mad about this: It's possible Sessions told Trump something else in private. Or the president is throwing others under the bus \u2014 he tried to discredit many of the officials involved in the Russia investigation in the same New York Times interview \u2014 before the bus hits him.", "qid": 870, "docid": "8a85da2a79fd42b665ec58f06b3b9fbb", "score": 10.086199760437012}, {"content": "Title: How a transgender teen\u2019s cries for help on reddit and Tumblr powered a movement against \u2018conversion therapy\u2019 Content: _\u201cIf you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide and obviously failed to delete this post from my queue.

Born Joshua Ryan Alcorn in Kings Mills, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, Alcorn came from a conservative Christian household, which, she wrote, reacted \u201cextremely negatively\u201d to her decision to come out as transgender. Convinced that she would never be able to transition successfully into a woman, Alcorn committed suicide by walking out into traffic on Interstate 71 in Ohio on Dec. 28. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A message that Alcorn posted on Reddit in November, a month before her death -- titled \u201cIs this considered abuse?\u201d -- shows just how trapped she felt by her situation. Alcorn said her parents denied her request to start treatment to transition to a woman and cut her off from friends and social media. \"The[y] would only let me see biased Christian therapists, who instead of listening to my feelings would try to change me into a straight male who loved God, and I would cry after every session because I felt like it was hopeless and there was no way I would ever become a girl,\" she wrote of her attendance in these sessions, known as \"conversion therapy.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"Please help me, I don't know what I should do and I can't take much more of this,\" she writes at the end of the note. \"I'm stuck.\u201d Her post generated a huge response on Reddit: In more than 100 comments, people variously counseled her to stick it out until she turned 18, seek legal emancipation, or reach out to child services or LGBT organizations for help. \"Stay strong and don't allow yourself to internalize any of their hate. You are good, you are worthy of love, and you can be exactly who you want to be,\" responded Reddit user Alyssa_B. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Alcorn's death has helped power a political movement to ban the type of counseling that she received. And it was a stark and painful reminder that the feelings Alcorn experienced are common among lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender teens, who face harassment, discrimination and a sense of being different in addition to the normal pressures of teenage life. Following her death, the Transgender Human Rights Institute, an advocacy organization, started a petition on the White House Web site in January to call on U.S. government leadership to forbid licensed clinicians from practicing conversion therapy -- a range of mental health practices that seek to change the sexual orientation or gender identities of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people -- on minors. Psychoanalytic and therapeutic treatments for sexual orientation fell out of favor in the medical community after the 1960s, but have continued to receive support from some religious organizations and practitioners that see what they call \"unwanted homosexuality\" as a condition that can be cured or suppressed. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The petition, dubbed \u201cLeelah\u2019s law,\u201d gathered more than 100,000 signatures by April. On Wednesday, the White House responded to the petition, supporting efforts at the state level to ban conversion therapy for minors. \"The overwhelming scientific evidence demonstrates that conversion therapy, especially when it is practiced on young people, is neither medically nor ethically appropriate and can cause substantial harm,\" wrote Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Obama. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Two days after Alcorn's death, mother Carla Alcorn gave an interview to CNN in which she referred to her child as \"Josh\" and said she and her husband didn't support their child being transgender because of religious reason. \"But we told him that we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what.\" *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In many parts of America, conversion therapy is still a divisive issue. California, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. have all banned licensed professionals from using conversion therapy on minors, and 15 other states are considering similar legislation. (Alcorn apparently saw a psychiatrist who prescribed her medication, but it isn't clear whether the Christian therapists she talked about were licensed.) But a ban on conversion therapy for minors failed in the Colorado Senate on Wednesday, and a similar bill failed to pass in New York last year. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In the opposite direction, some states are now considering legislation to protect practitioners of conversion therapy. A bill introduced in Oklahoma would bar state or local governments from restricting or prohibiting same-sex attraction or \u201cgender confusion\u201d counseling, as long as it did not involve electro-shock, ice baths, touch therapy and certain other techniques. The bill died in March without coming to a vote. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The map below shows states considering legislation that would roll back LGBT protections or promote conversion therapy, as of March 24, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Opponents and proponents of conversion therapy are also fighting it out in the courts. In New Jersey, the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit in November 2012 against a gay conversion therapy referral service, called Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing, on behalf of four men who say therapists affiliated with the service subjected them to humiliating treatments. The judge in the case ruled in February that advertising homosexuality as a curable mental disorder would violate the state\u2019s Consumer Fraud Act. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **The fraught history of conversion therapy** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The battle over conversion therapy revolves around the nature of homosexuality, what exactly conversion therapy consists of, and whether it is harmful or coercive when practiced on minors. The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a disorder in 1973, and echoing the broad consensus, the American Psychological Association clearly says that \"both heterosexual behavior and homosexual behavior are normal aspects of human sexuality.\" A slew of medical organizations -- including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the World Health Organization -- have spoken out against conversion therapy. The American Psychoanalytic Association has said there is no evidence that it works, and that it can result in \u201csubstantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging internalized attitudes.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \"The bottom line from a scientific perspective, from our perspective, there is no scientific evidence to support such therapies, that they work or that they\u2019re safe,\" says Clinton Anderson, the director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Concerns Office of the American Psychological Association. But while it fell out of favor with the broader mental health community, conversion therapy began to resurface elsewhere in the late 1980s, in part due to support by conservative religious organizations such as Focus on the Family. Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who is a leading voice against conversion therapy, described its rise as a backlash to the gay rights movement, part of the politics and culture wars that accompanied the push for expanded gay rights and gay marriage. \"Any time a committee,\" Drescher said, \"was considering passing a gay rights law, the hearings would include testimony from so-called ex-gays saying, 'I used to be gay, I\u2019m not anymore. You shouldn\u2019t be giving gay people rights, because they\u2019re not like black people. No one is born gay, and they can change it if they just change their minds.'\" Proponents of conversion therapy reject this political motivation and say they are truly trying to help. \"I was part of Exodus [International, an \"ex-gay\" Christian ministry] in the 80s and 90s ... and the goals of Exodus were to try to provide help for people that wanted it,\" said Jeff Johnston, an issues analyst at Focus on the Family. \"And we were grateful when organizations like Focus on the Family came along and said, yeah, we want to let other people know that there\u2019s help and that people can leave homosexuality if they want.\" Dr. Joseph Nicolosi, a clinical psychologist who developed a type of conversion therapy called reparative therapy, describes his practice as a kind of non-coercive talk therapy. Reparative therapy, which seeks to repair \"the male homosexual's emotional alienation with men,\" engages clients in a dialogue and provides them with education that is \"scientifically grounded,\" says Nicolosi. \"We are not forcing people to change, we are not shaming them, we are not making them feel bad about themselves.\" Critics cite numerous examples of abuse and impropriety. Part of the issue is that what constitutes \"conversion therapy\" is somewhat ill-defined; it encompasses a broad range of practices that draw on behavioral and psychoanalytic therapy, hypnosis, and prayer, among other influences. \u201cConversion therapy involves techniques that people learn on the street,\" says Drescher. \"It\u2019s not really taught in training programs for psychiatrists or psychologists or clinical social workers.\u201d And other accounts show conversion therapy can wander into more unusual territory, from touch therapy to Aboriginal ceremonies to hypnosis. And many individuals have reported abuse. Some conversion therapists employ a form of psychological treatment known as \u201caversion therapy,\u201d for example inducing discomfort, pain, electric shocks, nausea or vomiting while showing the patient homoerotic images. In the case against JONAH in New Jersey, the plaintiffs allege that conversion therapists had them engage in degrading practices, like stripping naked and beating an effigy of one of the plaintiff's mothers. (Defenders of JONAH say the lawsuit is without merit.) *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Mental health professionals are particularly concerned about increasing psychological pressure on LGBT kids, who already have much higher rates of depression, anxiety and suicide compared with heterosexual youth. In a poll by the Pew Research Center, roughly one-third of LGBT respondents said they had been physically threatened or attacked, while 40 percent said they had been rejected by a friend or family member because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A study by San Francisco State University found that LGBT youth who were \"highly rejected\" by their parents or caregivers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity were eight times more likely to have attempted suicide and six times more likely to report high levels of depression than other LGBT youth. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Anderson says the idea of promoting a therapy to change something that is not a disorder \"fundamentally problematic.\" \"We think [it] contributes to the atmosphere in society of stigma that causes prejudice, causes discrimination, causes great distress.\" **An experience with conversion therapy** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Mathew Shurka, a 26-year-old who was raised in Great Neck, a suburb of New York, said he also experienced odd and coercive treatment during his five years of conversion therapy. Between the ages of 16 and 21, Shurka saw four different conversion therapists and went to one conversion therapy camp, called Journey to Manhood. He is now a spokesman for the National Center for Lesbian Rights\u2019 anti-conversion therapy campaign, called #BornPerfect. Shurka says his experience consisted mostly of talk therapy, with a few more disturbing practices. One therapist encouraged him to use masturbation and pornography as a tool to associate with \"the imagery of the female body,\u201d he says. He also prescribed an intense program of male bonding, which involved spending as much time with men and avoiding women in an effort to eschew effeminate behaviors. Unfortunately, this also meant that Shurka avoided contact with his sisters and his mother for three years. \u201cThe goal was to have as little communication with her as possible,\u201d he says of his mother. \u201cIt started to really tear apart my home.\" As he got older, Shurka says that his efforts at male bonding actually made him more popular at school, and he became intimate with a woman. At the time, he saw that as a sign that the therapy was working. But he said his depression and attraction to men was only growing. His grades dropped and he began to contemplate suicide. And every time he got into a sexual situation with a woman, he would have a panic attack. Shurka says the darkest point came when his therapist and his father sought to get him Viagra pills to help him sleep with women. \u201cThis is probably the most traumatizing part, because I\u2019m 18 years old, I was healthy, I was young, I did not have erectile dysfunction, and I\u2019m in this bathroom taking these pills waiting to have sex with a woman in the room next door, just so I can get the approval of my community or my therapist or my father,\u201d he says. \u201cI really felt like I was disabled.\u201d Like other kids who have gone through conversion therapy, Shurka couldn't shake the belief that, because he was still gay, he had failed. After becoming estranged from his father and reuniting with his mother, he enrolled himself back into conversion therapy for several years, before accepting his sexual orientation at 21. **Related stories:** *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico - _Leelah Alcorn's death was tragic, but harassing her parents is not the answer_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico - _The U.S. is still divided on what causes homosexuality_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico - _Map: More than half of states may roll back LGBT rights_ *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "qid": 870, "docid": "d6edfd38e73b0a5108a945ace2d74eb0", "score": 10.074700355529785}, {"content": "Title: Women charged in D.C. assault; Rockville teen drowns in pool Content: Two transgender women were attacked early Saturday in separate incidents in Northeast D.C., police said.

While he has not closely studied the military\u2019s policy, he told the troops, \u201cI come at this kind of question from a fundamental starting point, which is that we want to make our conditions and experience of service as attractive as possible to our best people in our country.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m very open-minded about \u2014 otherwise about what their personal lives and proclivities are, provided they can do what we need them to do for us. That\u2019s the important criteria. Are they going to be excellent service members?\u201d The response caused ripples among gender rights advocates, not only because it came just days after Carter was sworn in but also because it was viewed as just the latest sign that there is renewed momentum to lift the ban, which remained in place even after the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy regarding openly gay troops was lifted in 2011. More than 15,000 transgender men and women serve in the military, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank that studies sexual orientation. While \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was lifted by Congress, the transgender ban is a policy that could be lifted administratively by the Obama administration. Supporters of the transgender ban have said lifting it could hurt unit cohesion and combat readiness. But rights advocates have said it could be lifted without incident, just as \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d was, and have cited studies that have found there would be no harm in letting transgender members serve openly and that lifting the policy would be not be administratively complicated. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that President Obama agreed with Carter\u2019s sentiment that all Americans who are qualified to serve should be able to serve, but he declined to discuss next steps. \u201cWe here at the White House welcome the comments from the secretary of defense,\u201d he told reporters during a briefing. \u201cBut in terms of \u2014 of additional steps the Department of Defense will take to address the matter, I\u2019d refer you to the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d A spokesman for the Pentagon said a review began this month of the military\u2019s health policies, including the transgender policy. The routine review will be completed in 12 to 18 months, he said. The last time a review like this took place was in 2011. Advocates played down the significance of the review, saying the military has conducted this same exercise repeatedly, and time and again officials have left the transgender ban in place. \u201cIt\u2019s just not enough,\u201d said Allyson Robinson, policy director of SPARTA, a group that advocates for transgender service members. \u201cThis is a very specific problem, and it needs to be properly addressed by a process that\u2019s proven effective, and this one has proven exactly the opposite.\u201d Carter\u2019s remarks on Sunday came in response to a question by Jesse M. Ehrenfeld, a Navy lieutenant commander and physician based in Kandahar, about transgender service in austere environments. In an e-mail, Ehrenfeld said he asked the question because he has treated a transgender service member and interacted with others. \u201cI am continually struck by how these individuals, who risk their lives every day to support our mission, live not in fear of the enemy, but rather in fear of being discovered for who they are,\u201d wrote Ehrenfeld, an officer for nearly seven years who lives in Nashville with his partner. Among those present for Carter\u2019s remarks was a transgender service member, according to SPARTA, which did not disclose the service member\u2019s name because coming out could be grounds for dismissal. \u201cI wanted to tell him I\u2019m one of those people serving in silence,\u201d the service member, who holds an enlisted rank, said in a statement issued by the group. \u201cI love my job, I\u2019m supported and respected by the people I serve with, and I want to make the military a career. But until the regs are updated, just speaking up for myself could end it all.\u201d The exchange came after a period in which many thought that efforts to lift the ban had stalled at the Pentagon. Many advocates worried that time could be running out as the end of Obama\u2019s term approached. Dismissal proceedings continued for service members discovered to be transgender. Then in December, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James suggested that the ban may eventually be lifted. Earlier this month, the military announced it would provide hormone treatment to Chelsea Manning, the former Army private in prison for leaking classified documents. And immediately after being sworn in, Carter appointed as his chief of staff Air Force Undersecretary Eric Fanning, who is openly gay. Gay rights advocates have taken these developments to be a positive sign for their cause and urged the military to go further. \u201cWe urge Secretary Carter to put action to his comments by ordering an immediate review of the outdated regulations that prevent transgender service members from serving our nation openly and honestly,\u201d David Stacy, government affairs director at the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement. \u201cOur nation\u2019s transgender service members bravely and heroically serve our nation, and they certainly deserve to be able to be honest about who they are.\u201d Juliet Eilperin contributed to this report.", "qid": 870, "docid": "c056e5b6-bb73-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6", "score": 10.056699752807617}, {"content": "Title: As Trump moves to soften his image, Democrats seek to harden it Content: Is it too late for a Donald Trump makeover? Even as the billionaire real estate mogul took steps this week to soften his brash persona, Democrats ramped up their efforts to tangle Trump in his own words \u2014 rushing to portray him as immature, misogynistic and bigoted. The battle to define the Republican presidential front-runner comes as Trump has sought to professionalize his campaign and persuade party leaders that he is capable of mounting a credible general-election fight. On Thursday, Trump\u2019s chief strategist told a group of Republicans behind closed doors that Trump has been playing a \u201cpart\u201d and is \u201cnow evolving.\u201d But his opponents on the left, looking to weaken him for the fall, are already rolling out reminders of his most undisciplined moments. \u201c#TrumpHatesUs\u201d declares a spot from NARAL Pro-Choice America launching this week in Pennsylvania, which plays audio of some of his most inflammatory comments over portraits of women of varied ages and ethnicities. A new web video from Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Democratic contender Hillary Clinton, labels Trump \u201cdangerously unpresidential,\u201d stringing together footage of him bragging about the size of his hands and mocking Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s water drinking habits. \u201cDonald Trump is going to have a hard time running away from his own words,\u201d said Joel Foster, political director of NARAL Pro-Choice America. The attacks underscore the difficulty that Trump and the Republican Party will have in softening the potential nominee\u2019s rough edges for a general-election campaign, particularly when brazenness is central to the candidate\u2019s appeal to his followers. \u201cOne thing you learn very quickly in political consulting is the fruitlessness of trying to get a candidate to change who he or she fundamentally is at their core,\u201d said Republican strategist Whit Ayres, who did polling for Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign before he dropped out of the race. \u201cSo is the snide, insulting, misogynistic guy we\u2019ve seen really who Donald Trump is? Or is it the disciplined, respectful, unifying Trump we saw for seven minutes after the New York primary? \u201cNone of us can give ourselves a personality transplant,\u201d Ayres added. Well-funded Democratic groups already have developed searing lines of attack about Trump\u2019s character and temperament, seizing on remarks he has made on the campaign trail. The onslaught will begin in earnest if he secures the GOP nomination in early June, when Priorities USA plans to kick off a $125 million television and digital ad campaign contrasting Clinton with her GOP rival. \u201cThe Republicans taught us a very important lesson,\u201d said Guy Cecil, Priorities\u2019 senior strategist. \u201cThey waited month after month before taking on Trump. We\u2019re obviously not going to make that mistake.\u201d The Clinton campaign has increasingly made Trump\u2019s controversial comments about Muslims and other groups the core of its bid for the Democratic nomination and eventually the general election. The strategy was increasingly apparent in advance of this week\u2019s New York primary, when the campaign released three television ads \u2014 including one in Spanish \u2014 aimed at convincing Democratic primary voters that Clinton is willing and able to combat Trump. That\u2019s a message, powered by Trump\u2019s own words, that they intend to carry into November if she clinches the nomination. \u201cI think that Donald Trump\u2019s long campaign filled with divisive, bigoted, intolerant comments have fully formed his image with the American public,\u201d Clinton pollster and senior advisor Joel Benenson. \u201cIn almost every poll I\u2019ve seen in the last two months or so, the vast majority have fewer than 10 percent of the people who are undecided in their opinion about Mr. Trump.\u201d The early attempt to define Trump is similar to a tactic that President Obama and the Priorities group deployed in the spring of 2012, when they launched a series of ads casting Republican Mitt Romney as the enemy of middle-class workers. Trump is in a much more precarious position than Romney was at this point in the race. Trump has a 67 percent unfavorable rating \u2014 the lowest since 1984 of a candidate who went on to be a major party\u2019s nominee, according to a Washington Post-ABC poll released last week. At this point in 2012, Romney was seen unfavorably by 48 percent of the general public \u2014 19 points better than Trump. But Trump is dismissive of the idea that his provocative comments have inflicted permanent political damage. When pressed Thursday by NBC\u2019s Matt Lauer on how he can win over voters offended by his rhetoric about women, Mexicans and Muslims, Trump essentially shrugged. \u201cI did some things and I\u2019ve said some things in fun,\u201d said the former reality television star, comparing his comments to language he used on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d \u201cA lot of that was entertainment,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI think that women will be big fans.\u201d Trump also promised that his tone would soon shift. \u201cAt the right time, I will be so presidential, you will be so bored,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will say, \u2018Can he have a little bit more energy?\u2019 But I know when to be presidential.\u201d In coming weeks, Trump is expected to put a new focus on inclusiveness, touting the number of women and Latinos who have worked for Trump properties, according to a campaign official who requested anonymity to discuss internal plans. Some are likely to show up on the campaign trail for him as surrogates. On Thursday, Trump also took a stand against a controversial law in North Carolina that requires transgender people to use restrooms that match the gender on their birth certificates. He called the measure unnecessary and noted the economic fallout that the state has suffered since it was announced, putting himself at odds with the party\u2019s conservative base. \u201cYou leave it the way it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble.\u201d Even so, advisers acknowledge that the central part of Trump\u2019s appeal is his outspokenness, and he is unlikely to ratchet that down. For every example this week of a mellow, conciliatory Trump, there was another moment in which he reverted to his bellicose form. In a restrained victory speech in New York Tuesday night, he referred respectfully to chief rival Ted Cruz as \u201cSenator Cruz.\u201d But by Wednesday, at his first campaign stop in Indianapolis, his reference to \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d \u2014 a crowd favorite \u2014 was back. Later in Berlin, Md., he went aggressively after \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d Clinton and accused her of criminal and ethical wrongdoings, suggesting he would launch an investigation into unspecified crimes if he became president. Behind the scenes, a team of political veterans is working on Trump\u2019s behalf to convince state party chairmen and other GOP officials that he is maturing as a candidate and that his expanding campaign team is up to task of leading the party into the fall election. Trump\u2019s newly empowered top aide, Paul Manafort, and political director Rick Wiley held private meetings Thursday with party officials gathered at a luxury resort in Hollywood, Fla., for a Republican National Committee meeting. Helping Manafort and Wiley woo party elites was Bill Palatucci, an RNC member and longtime confidant of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Manafort told RNC members in a closed-door briefing that his candidate has been playing a \u201cpart\u201d on the campaign trail but is starting to pivot toward presenting a more businesslike and presidential \u201cpersona.\u201d \u201cHe gets it,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cThe part that he\u2019s been playing is now evolving into the part that you\u2019ve been expecting. The negatives will come down, the image is going to change, but \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 is still going to be \u2018Crooked Hillary.\u2019 \u201d The courting by Trump\u2019s advisers came after Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich visited the RNC conclave on Thursday to make the case for their own candidacies in private huddles and more formal briefings. Cruz told reporters that Trump was a \u201cniche candidate\u201d who is incapable of winning support from a majority of Republicans, let alone defeat the Democratic nominee in a general election. \u201cTo be a strong and effective candidate, you\u2019ve got to put together a majority,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHe can\u2019t earn a majority.\u201d His campaign manager, Jeff Roe, used even stronger language, saying that a Trump nomination would be disastrous for Republican candidates down the ballot in November. That message is now central to Cruz\u2019s argument as he tries to convince voters that he is a stronger choice. A new web ad released by his campaign Thursday depicted a fictional meeting of Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides strategizing against Trump.

They aim to dock with an orbiting space lab and remain aboard for 30 days, a crucial step in China\u2019s plans to operate its own space station by 2022 and part of a much broader space program that has ambitions to put astronauts back on the moon and land an unmanned rover on Mars. State-run China Central Television (CCTV) showed the Shenzhou 11 spacecraft taking off from a launch center on the edge of the Gobi Desert in northern China at 7:30 a.m., carried by a Long March 2F rocket. The astronauts were seen on board saluting seconds before takeoff. They will dock with the Tiangong-2 lab in two days and conduct scientific experiments, testing computers as well as propulsion and life-support systems, CCTV reported. After the launch was declared a success, Defense Minister Fan Changlong read a congratulatory message from President Xi Jinping that called for China\u2019s astronauts to explore space \u201cmore deeply and more broadly.\u201d Xi also encouraged them to \u201cconstantly break new ground for the manned space program, so that Chinese people will take bigger steps and march further in [their] space probe, to make new contributions to the building of China into a space power.\u201d The astronauts are Jing Haipeng, who will turn 50 during the trip and is flying his third mission, and Chen Dong, 37. \u201cIt is any astronaut\u2019s dream and pursuit to be able to perform many space missions,\u201d Jing said Sunday, according to the state-run Xinhua News Agency. China is spending heavily on a space program that aims to catch up with the United States and Russia, both established space powers, and outpace Asian rivals India and Japan. As in all those countries, the space program in China is a source of great national pride. China was excluded from participation in the International Space Station, largely because of U.S. concerns that its space program had a strong military component. Instead, it aims to build its own space station and hopes that other countries also will launch missions there. It insists that its motives are peaceful. \u201cShenzhou 11 is a new beginning. It marks the imminent end to the exploratory stage of China\u2019s manned space program,\u201d said Zhang Yulin, deputy commander in chief of China\u2019s manned space program and deputy chief of the armament development department of the Central Military Commission. Zhang said China hopes to carry out regular space missions after 2020, sending astronauts, engineers and even tourists into space several times a year, Xinhua reported. It will be the only country operating a space station after the International Space Station is retired in 2024. China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, and 10 years later it landed the Jade Rabbit rover on the moon \u2014 the first \u201csoft landing\u201d there in nearly four decades \u2014 although the rover later developed technical problems. It aims to land a rover on the far side of the moon by 2018 and send an unmanned vehicle to Mars by 2020, emulating the U.S. Viking landers in 1976. Ultimately, it hopes to land an astronaut on the moon by about 2025, more than five decades after American Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon. The current mission, lasting 33 days, is more than twice the length of China\u2019s last manned mission, in 2013, which spanned 15 days.

State television showed scientists in white and pale-blue coats applauding, shaking hands and congratulating each other after the craft, Chang\u2019e 3, landed safely at 9:12 p.m. local time. It also showed photographs of the moon\u2019s surface beamed back from the craft. The landing marked a significant advance in China\u2019s space program and a step toward its ambitions of one day following the United States in mounting a manned lunar mission. On Sunday, a six-wheeled rover named Yutu, or Jade Rabbit, is scheduled to emerge from the landing vehicle and begin a three-month-long mission to explore the moon\u2019s surface. The moon lander, which weighs more than a ton, landed in the right eye of the lunar feature dubbed the Man in the Moon, in a large and relatively flat volcanic crater known as the Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows. Its rockets shut off when it was about four yards above the surface, and the craft fell the remaining distance. The landing craft, which is designed to remain in place and operate for a year, carries a telescope that will survey space from the moon\u2019s surface and an ultraviolet camera that will observe the Earth and the plasmasphere surrounding it. The rover, which will roam around for three months, will not only analyze the topsoil in a previously unexplored region of the moon but also will collect through its radar system information about the lunar surface to a depth of 100 yards. Dean Cheng, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said the radar system, in particular, would yield useful data. \u201cChina has said that to be a global power, you do have to contribute to the global pool of scientific knowledge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moon, for all that it is our closest celestial neighbor, is rather unexplored. . . . China is, in fact, contributing to the pool of lunar knowledge.\u201d The rover will be powered by solar panels during the lunar day, and atomic energy storage batteries will keep it warm and prevent its electronic systems from freezing during the lunar night, which lasts the equivalent of two weeks on Earth and can see temperatures as low as 180 degrees below zero Celsius, the equivalent of 292 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. \u201cCompared to the last century\u2019s space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, mankind\u2019s current return to the moon is more based on curiosity and exploration of the unknown universe,\u201d Sun Huixian, the project\u2019s deputy chief engineer told the official Xinhua News Agency. \u201cChina\u2019s lunar program is an important component of mankind\u2019s activities to explore the peaceful use of space.\u201d The lander and the rover are named for a Chinese myth about a woman named Chang\u2019e who swallowed magic pills and took her pet rabbit, Yutu, to the moon, where she has lived as a goddess ever since. \u201cThough people have discovered that the moon is bleached and desolate, it doesn\u2019t change its splendid role in Chinese traditional culture,\u201d Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Beijing\u2019s Peking University, told Xinhua. China hopes to mount another mission to the moon in 2017 that would collect rock and soil samples. It also hopes to launch a space station by about 2023 and eventually, perhaps, establish lunar bases and send missions into deep space. Its space program has the advantage of consistent funding and top-level political support, and the successful moon landing will ensure that continues, Cheng said. \u201cThis was a big step,\u201d said Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. \u201cIt makes [a manned mission] far more feasible.\u201d China\u2019s space program has established itself as a significant player globally, Johnson-Freese said. \u201cIt wants to work with developed countries to show it is a major space nation,\u201d she said, adding that China\u2019s program has also encouraged other countries, such as India, to invest more in space exploration to show they are not falling behind in the technological race. The program is a source of deep national pride and was widely celebrated Saturday by users of the weibo microblogging sites. \u201cAt this moment my eyes are full of tears, I\u2019m proud of my motherland, I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Chinese,\u201d wrote Huanranbingshi2000.

The 286-page National Research Council report, the culmination of an 18-month, $3.2 million investigation mandated by Congress, says that to continue on the present course under budgets that don\u2019t keep pace with inflation \u201cis to invite failure, disillusionment, and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the United States does best.\u201d The report makes a case for sending astronauts back to the moon. That had been a key element of NASA\u2019s strategy under President George W. Bush. But President Obama and his advisers explicitly opposed another moon landing (\u201cI just have to say pretty bluntly here: We\u2019ve been there before,\u201d Obama said in a speech on space policy in 2010). A major argument against returning to the moon was that it didn\u2019t pencil out \u2014 that there wasn\u2019t nearly enough money dedicated to the program. Now the NRC\u2019s Committee on Human Spaceflight has come to the same conclusion about the Obama administration\u2019s vision for NASA. If the goal is a human landing on Mars, the current strategy won\u2019t work. \u201cAbsent a very fundamental change in the nation\u2019s way of doing business, it is not realistic to believe that we can achieve the consensus goal of reaching Mars,\u201d Mitch Daniels, the former Indiana governor and co-chair of the committee, said Wednesday morning in an interview. A 2009 committee appointed by Obama urged NASA to keep its options open while investing in spaceflight technology and letting the commercial sector handle routine trips to low Earth orbit. But the NRC reviewers argue that NASA and its international partners should focus on the \u201chorizon goal\u201d of Mars and do whatever it takes to get there, step by step, avoiding changes in strategic direction. NASA officials, aware that critics see the agency as adrift, say they have already been moving in the direction advocated by the NRC. Their strategy targets Mars, just as the NRC report now demands, they say. \u201cAll this work will eventually enable astronaut missions to Mars,\u201d NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a recent NASA white paper. \u201cNASA\u2019s been doing some work, and has been doing some thinking over the last six months, that is in alignment with what the NRC says the top-level goals are,\u201d said Greg Williams, a NASA deputy associate administrator. But Williams was cool to the suggestion of a return to the moon, saying the airless moon offers little help in developing the kind of descent and landing techniques needed on Mars, which has a thin, troublesome atmosphere. The NRC committee probed the philosophical question of why we send people into space to begin with. The committee concluded that the purely practical, economic benefits of human spaceflight do not justify the costs but that the aspirational nature of the endeavor may make it worth the effort. The report says the United States should pursue international collaborations that would include China \u2014 currently treated as a space rival and not as a potential partner. The report cites three potential pathways to Mars, two involving a return to the moon. A lunar landing and habitat would help develop technologies that could later be used on a Mars mission, the report says. The third pathway is essentially the one that the Obama administration has chosen, which includes the Asteroid Redirect Mission. The plan, still being studied, would use a robotic spacecraft to grab a small asteroid that is orbiting the sun and passing close to the Earth and then tug the asteroid to a new orbit around the moon. Astronauts would then go to the rock and take samples. The mission architecture would take advantage of big- ticket NASA projects already underway. Most notably, it would provide a destination for the Orion capsule being developed by NASA in tandem with a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System (SLS). The asteroid mission has been politically controversial \u2014 Republicans in Congress unsuccessfully tried last year to forbid NASA to do it \u2014 and it has technical challenges, not the least of which is the difficulty identifying an asteroid that could plausibly be captured by a robotic spacecraft. The NRC report is not bullish on the idea. The report says the mission involves the creation of a large number of \u201cdead end\u201d technologies that don\u2019t get the United States closer to a Mars landing. The committee raised a safety issue. The current schedule calls for an unmanned SLS launch in 2017, followed by a mission with a crew in 2021. The committee feared that launch teams could become rusty with long lags between missions. The program \u201ccannot provide the flight frequency required to maintain competence and safety,\u201d the report states. NASA official Williams said Wednesday that the cadence of launches will speed up after 2021. The committee did not delve deeply into what the private sector, operating commercially, might accomplish independently of the government. There are many space buffs, including SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who have said they want to land on Mars. But committee member John Sommerer said Wednesday that it is unrealistic to expect a commercial company to spend the money and take on the risk necessary to achieve human exploration on the Martian surface. \u201cYou need to develop a very substantial armamentarium of really high-tech stuff to get humans on Mars,\u201d he said. \u201cMars is very hard.\u201d John Logsdon, professor emeritus of George Washington University\u2019s Space Policy Institute, said the report has a familiar ring to it. \u201cThey go through all this negative analysis and still conclude we ought to go to Mars. No one ever says, \u2018Let\u2019s lower our ambitions.\u2019 It\u2019s always, \u2018Increase the budget,\u2019 not \u2018Lower ambitions,\u2019 \u201d he said.

Moreover, every nation\u2019s government has also been responsible for any \u201cnon-governmental entities\u201d (i.e. corporations or citizens) that wanted to do so. And, as if that weren\u2019t clear enough, the so- called \u201cMoon Treaty\u201d of 1979 (signed by nine nations, but not the United States) clearly states that private ownership of the moon is forbidden. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But fast-forward 50 years, and we\u2019re suddenly having a serious discussion about returning to the moon. Eighteen entrants are still alive in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, which will award a $20 million grand prize to any team that develops a robotic device capable of landing on the moon, crawling 500 meters on, above or below the moon\u2019s surface and sending back HDTV \u201cmooncasts\u201d for people on Earth to watch. If all goes according to plan, we could even see a winning Google Lunar X Prize mission to the moon before the Dec. 31, 2016 deadline. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It\u2019s not just U.S. innovators who are getting involved \u2013 competitors from Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Spain, Germany, Hungary, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, China, Romania and Russia are also coming up with their own plans for moon missions. In short, we\u2019re coming up against an international space law scenario that everyone\u2019s been dreading: \u201cA private launch system based on the Isle of Man, launching somebody into orbit who would then be transferred to L1 on a tug that was run out of Dubai, and then to a lander operated by somebody in Australia.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico To make sure that the United States gets first dibs on whatever\u2019s out there \u2013 maybe helium-3 or valuable rare earth elements \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of discussion already about how to create the right legal framework to get around that pesky 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty. The best option for now is the claim that a \u201cloophole\u201d exists whereby sovereign ownership rights to the moon might be banned, but private ownership rights are not banned. (Remember, we never signed the 1979 Moon Treaty. Ha! Instant loophole.) According to one piece of proposed legislation known as the Space Settlement Prize Act, the first private venture to establish a moon base would be able to claim up to 600,000 square miles of the moon\u2019s surface. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Other arguments have made the case that the commercial exploration of the moon should follow the logic of the Law of the Sea Treaty, which can be basically described as \u201cfinder\u2019s keepers\u201d when it comes to activities such as mineral extraction. And, last but not least, there\u2019s the \u201cWell, China is going to do it anyway, so we should do it first\u201d argument for selectively opting out of the parts of the UN Outer Space Treaty that would block U.S. commercial enterprises from freely commercializing the moon. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So that\u2019s why the FAA ruling on the moon is so clever \u2013 it bends the ball around the 1967 Outer Space Treaty by clearly stating that the U.S. government must still approve whatever a company brings to the moon and whatever it does on the moon. It pays homage to the 1979 \u201cMoon Treaty\u201d by stating that the ruling does not imply \u201cownership of the moon.\u201d It dives into the Law of the Sea Treaty by establishing a provision for mining and exploration rights, provided some base of operation has already been established on the moon\u2019s surface. And it keeps America\u2019s legal options open to take on China at a later date by suggesting that the \u201cnational regulatory framework is ill-equipped to enable the U.S. government to fulfill its obligations\u201d under the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So what exactly did the FAA give Bigelow? A \u201clanding spot\u201d on the moon? The right to set up an inflatable habitat on the moon? Pre-approval for a future moon payload? If you\u2019re not a space law expert, it\u2019s hard to tell. Maybe Robert Bigelow, the founder of Bigelow Aerospace, put it best when he told Reuters: \u201cIt just means that somebody else isn\u2019t licensed to land on top of you or land on top of where exploration and prospecting activities are going on, which may be quite a distance from the lunar station.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So here\u2019s the deal: Companies are going to the moon, and they don\u2019t want to come back empty-handed. They are not getting much money from the government, so they need to make every moon visit commercially viable. The easiest way to do that is by making some aspect of moon exploration relatively routine, while letting NASA figure out all the hard stuff \u2013 such as how to get to Mars.

And that could be the real reason for Bigelow Aerospace to get the FAA to make the ruling. Imagine setting up a vast number of Bigelow\u2019s inflatable habitats on the moon\u2019s surface and getting access to all the surrounding mineral, mining and exploration rights.

The FAA, in a carefully worded policy statement, has essentially outlined a scenario by which a U.S.-based company \u2013 Bigelow Aerospace \u2013 could stake future claims to lunar property. That could be huge. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For nearly 50 years, ever since the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty (signed by over 100 nations, including the United States), there has been unanimous international agreement that no nation could stake a sovereign claim to the moon for any reason. Moreover, every nation\u2019s government has also been responsible for any \u201cnon-governmental entities\u201d (i.e. corporations or citizens) that wanted to do so. And, as if that weren\u2019t clear enough, the so- called \u201cMoon Treaty\u201d of 1979 (signed by nine nations, but not the United States) clearly states that private ownership of the moon is forbidden. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But fast-forward 50 years, and we\u2019re suddenly having a serious discussion about returning to the moon. Eighteen entrants are still alive in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, which will award a $20 million grand prize to any team that develops a robotic device capable of landing on the moon, crawling 500 meters on, above or below the moon\u2019s surface and sending back HDTV \u201cmooncasts\u201d for people on Earth to watch. If all goes according to plan, we could even see a winning Google Lunar X Prize mission to the moon before the Dec. 31, 2016 deadline. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico It\u2019s not just U.S. innovators who are getting involved \u2013 competitors from Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Spain, Germany, Hungary, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, China, Romania and Russia are also coming up with their own plans for moon missions. In short, we\u2019re coming up against an international space law scenario that everyone\u2019s been dreading: \u201cA private launch system based on the Isle of Man, launching somebody into orbit who would then be transferred to L1 on a tug that was run out of Dubai, and then to a lander operated by somebody in Australia.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico To make sure that the United States gets first dibs on whatever\u2019s out there \u2013 maybe helium-3 or valuable rare earth elements \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of discussion already about how to create the right legal framework to get around that pesky 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty. The best option for now is the claim that a \u201cloophole\u201d exists whereby sovereign ownership rights to the moon might be banned, but private ownership rights are not banned. (Remember, we never signed the 1979 Moon Treaty. Ha! Instant loophole.) According to one piece of proposed legislation known as the Space Settlement Prize Act, the first private venture to establish a moon base would be able to claim up to 600,000 square miles of the moon\u2019s surface. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Other arguments have made the case that the commercial exploration of the moon should follow the logic of the Law of the Sea Treaty, which can be basically described as \u201cfinder\u2019s keepers\u201d when it comes to activities such as mineral extraction. And, last but not least, there\u2019s the \u201cWell, China is going to do it anyway, so we should do it first\u201d argument for selectively opting out of the parts of the UN Outer Space Treaty that would block U.S. commercial enterprises from freely commercializing the moon. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So that\u2019s why the FAA ruling on the moon is so clever \u2013 it bends the ball around the 1967 Outer Space Treaty by clearly stating that the U.S. government must still approve whatever a company brings to the moon and whatever it does on the moon. It pays homage to the 1979 \u201cMoon Treaty\u201d by stating that the ruling does not imply \u201cownership of the moon.\u201d It dives into the Law of the Sea Treaty by establishing a provision for mining and exploration rights, provided some base of operation has already been established on the moon\u2019s surface. And it keeps America\u2019s legal options open to take on China at a later date by suggesting that the \u201cnational regulatory framework is ill-equipped to enable the U.S. government to fulfill its obligations\u201d under the 1967 UN Outer Space Treaty. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So what exactly did the FAA give Bigelow? A \u201clanding spot\u201d on the moon? The right to set up an inflatable habitat on the moon? Pre-approval for a future moon payload? If you\u2019re not a space law expert, it\u2019s hard to tell. Maybe Robert Bigelow, the founder of Bigelow Aerospace, put it best when he told Reuters: \u201cIt just means that somebody else isn\u2019t licensed to land on top of you or land on top of where exploration and prospecting activities are going on, which may be quite a distance from the lunar station.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico So here\u2019s the deal: Companies are going to the moon, and they don\u2019t want to come back empty-handed. They are not getting much money from the government, so they need to make every moon visit commercially viable. The easiest way to do that is by making some aspect of moon exploration relatively routine, while letting NASA figure out all the hard stuff \u2013 such as how to get to Mars.

Neufeld is a curator at the National Air and Space Museum and the author of \u201cVon Braun.\u201d\u201d _ Thanks to the New Horizons probe, which began its exploration of Pluto last month, scientists and the public can anticipate ever more exciting pictures and data about the dwarf planet. It will be the first encounter with a member of the Kuiper Belt of icy objects beyond Neptune. Yet the scheduled July 14 flyby will be of not one object but at least six: Pluto, Charon (a satellite half the size of Pluto) and four small moons \u2014 and who knows what else in orbit around their common center. Many wonders and insights about the origins and evolution of the solar system await. But this encounter may also mark the beginning of the end of a golden period of U.S. planetary exploration, particularly of our solar system\u2019s outer reaches. If marvelous things are found at Pluto, when would the next mission follow up? We can hope that New Horizons\u2019 flight past a small Kuiper Belt object in 2019 will be funded, but beyond that there is nothing. No spacecraft are planned to investigate Uranus or Neptune, which were visited only once each, by Voyager 2 in the 1980s. When the magnificent Cassini orbiter around Saturn runs out of propellant and crashes into that planet in 2017, that will be the end of data from the ringed planet and its astounding moons. Only mighty Jupiter will be favored, with the Juno spacecraft set to go into orbit in 2016. Following that, the next Jupiter missions are a European one not scheduled to reach it until 2030, and NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper, which will take about that long, assuming that it is funded. It was a hopeful sign that in the fiscal 2015 omnibus bill, Congress increased the study money for the Clipper \u2014 which will focus on Europa, Jupiter\u2019s icy moon with a possible life- bearing, subsurface ocean \u2014 from $15 million to $100 million. That makes the project a real possibility for the 2020s, but the Obama administration still needs to give it formal approval. Once before, in the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, the United States faltered in its commitment to exploring the solar system, one of the greatest scientific and technological achievements. The result was a long gap in missions, disguised only by the two Voyagers\u2019 magnificent encounters with the outer planets, and those probes launched in 1977. If we are to continue exploring our home system, Congress and the president need to commit to new funding. While the human spaceflight program falters from uncertainty and lack of convincing purpose, we know that planetary exploration provides enormous returns for the dollars invested. **Read more on this topic:** Dana Milbank: NASA\u2019s goal of a manned Mars mission doesn\u2019t match budget reality Eric Sterner: Five myths about NASA Michael D.

Plainclothes police were waiting for us at the platform in Lhasa. They ushered us to a nearby police station, where they spent an hour going through our belongings. They were thrilled to find in my backpack a \u201cprobe hound,\u201d as we call it in Chinese \u2014 a little electronic device that can detect wireless eavesdropping. They asked me why I, a writer, was carrying it. I told them I needed to know whether my home in Lhasa was being monitored. They confiscated the device. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke was visiting Lhasa. My wife and I had not planned our trip to coincide with Locke\u2019s, but domestic security officials, taking no chances, held us under house arrest. Woeser is a soft- spoken person with a gentle nature, but she does have a record of speaking truth to power on the topic of Tibet. In March, she was honored with the U.S. secretary of state\u2019s International Women of Courage Award. Chinese authorities, it seemed, wanted to ensure that Locke heard no voice that might spoil the perfect image of Tibet they had arranged for his controlled itinerary. And that meant they needed to keep Woeser at a distance. We were released after Locke departed, but plainclothes police followed us. One of our friends, noticing them, tried to take a photo, and they, noticing him, smashed his camera. Anyone who dared to speak with us got a threatening \u201cvisit\u201d from domestic security. And I was \u201cinvited\u201d to the police station for more interrogation about that probe hound. So I told them the full story. In the 1960s, Woeser\u2019s father, now deceased, had taken a large number of photos in Lhasa. Woeser thought it would be an interesting project \u2014 artistically, if nothing else \u2014 to revisit the same spots and take photos, half a century later, from the same angles. To make the project as nearly perfect as possible, she found her father\u2019s camera and bought film for it. Within a few days, she had taken 19 rolls of photos. When a young friend who was headed back to coastal China came to say goodbye, Woeser asked her to carry the film and get it developed. The friend agreed. The next day at airport security, agents \u201cdiscovered\u201d in her luggage a knife she had never seen before. The \u201cdiscovery\u201d triggered an \u201cenhanced examination\u201d of her belongings, which the police took away and then returned to her just as she was boarding the plane. She checked on the film. The boxes were the same but not the contents. Woeser had given her 19 rolls of exposed Fuji 120 film; the boxes now contained 15 rolls of unexposed Kodak 135 film. That led Woeser to suspect that listening devices had been planted in our home. Her request to her friend had been made orally and to her alone. No one else had been involved; no telephone or Internet communications were used. That was why I was carrying the probe hound. We wanted to know whether our home was bugged. I told all this to the police and then asked them to return the probe hound. They refused. It was \u201ccounterespionage equipment,\u201d I was told. Citizens have no right to own such a device. These things happened as the Edward Snowden revelations were attracting the world\u2019s attention. The Chinese government seemed gratified, even pleased. _Look! The United States is no better than China, so let\u2019s all just stop the mutual carping._ But let\u2019s not jump to conclusions. How comparable are the cases? Is it conceivable that the United States would tell a citizen that he has no right to a probe hound? In China, the government can enter any space of any citizen anytime it wants. It is the \u201ccounterespionage\u201d of citizens that is prohibited. **Read more from PostOpinions:** Jim Sciutto: China\u2019s blackout of U.S. media can no longer be ignored Perry Link: America\u2019s outdated view of China Xiao Qiang and Perry Link: Striving for freedom in the Chinese New Year", "qid": 871, "docid": "39d247ec-eb36-11e2-a301-ea5a8116d211", "score": 11.341099739074707}, {"content": "Title: U.S. starts \u2018swiftly\u2019 installing controversial antimissile battery in South Korea Content: SEOUL \u2014 The U.S. military started installing a controversial antimissile defense system in South Korea overnight Tuesday, triggering protests and sparking criticism that it was rushing to get the battery in place before the likely election of a president who opposes it. The sudden and unannounced move came only six days after the U.S. military command in South Korea secured the land to deploy the system, known as the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. Moon Jae-in, a liberal candidate who has a strong lead in polls ahead of a May 9 presidential election, has promised to review South Korea\u2019s decision to host the antimissile battery. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in Seoul that THAAD deployment has been rushed based on the timetable of South Korea\u2019s presidential election rather than North Korea\u2019s threats,\u201d said John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cTo some extent, the acceleration of THAAD deployment has \u2018worked,\u2019 limiting the next South Korean leader\u2019s room for maneuver,\u201d Delury said. \u201cBut there\u2019s the danger of a backlash among the South Korean public feeling like a pawn in the game of \u2018America First.\u2019 \u201d In Washington, Adm. Harry Harris, head of the Pacific Command, acknowledged Wednesday that China has attempted to pressure the government in Seoul not to deploy THAAD, and he criticized that effort. \u201cI find it preposterous that China would try to influence South Korea to not get a weapons system that\u2019s completely defensive against the very country that\u2019s allied with China,\u201d Harris said in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. The U.S. military command here in Seoul said the moves were in line with its announcement in July that THAAD would be deployed as soon as possible. \u201cLast night\u2019s action was necessary to swiftly deliver an additional layer of defense to South Korea against the growing North Korean missile threat,\u201d said Elise Van Pool, a spokeswoman for the command. The timing was due to public safety, she said. \u201cThe movement of the equipment entailed large convoys,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the interest of public safety and to ensure minimal impact on the local community, this movement was conducted at night.\u201d South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry said the two countries have been working \u201cto secure the swift operational capability of the THAAD system against North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile threat.\u201d \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s military plans to secure full capability of the THAAD system operation within the year,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. A spokesman for Moon, the Democratic Party of Korea\u2019s candidate for president, criticized the sudden moves overnight. \u201cMoon Jae-in has been consistent in his position on the THAAD deployment: that it must be decided by the next administration after enough public discussion and by national consensus,\u201d Park Kwang-on said in a statement. \u201cAny deployment that completely ignores appropriate processes must be suspended now, and the final decision should be made after consultation between South Korea and the U.S.,\u201d he said. Moon has a 10-point lead over his closest rival in the most recent polls, and political scientists expect him to be South Korea\u2019s next president, barring any dramatic developments. After equivocating for years, the South Korean government \u2014 led by then-President Park Geun-hye \u2014 decided in July to allow the deployment of the system to guard against the North Korean threat. Each THAAD battery includes at least six truck-mounted launchers that carry up to eight missiles each. They are designed to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles like the ones that North Korea has been launching at a steady clip. North Korea has bolstered the case for the system by test-firing dozens of missiles over the past year, all of them capable of hitting South Korea. Wednesday\u2019s moves to install the battery come at a particularly tense time on the Korean Peninsula. The United States is moving warships to the region while North Korea is vowing to counter any American strike. Beijing has vehemently protested the deployment, apparently concerned that the system\u2019s powerful radar could be used to keep tabs on China, and it has imposed painful economic boycotts on South Korean companies in response. \u201cThe deployment of THAAD in South Korea will destroy the strategic balance in the region and bring about a further increase in tensions,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, told reporters Wednesday in Beijing. \u201cThe Chinese side strongly urges the U.S. and South Korea to cancel the deployment and withdraw the equipment.\u201d Residents in the Seongju area, where the battery will be deployed, have also been protesting, worried that the system\u2019s presence will make them a target for North Korea\u2019s missiles. According to local reports, six trailers carrying the X-band radar, mobile launchers and other parts of the system were seen entering the site about midnight. A group of residents protested the move and tried to stop the equipment from being taken onto the site, clashing with police, the Yonhap News Agency reported from Seongju, in the southeast of South Korea. They waved placards saying \u201cNo THAAD, No War\u201d and \u201cHey, U.S.! Are you friends or occupying troops?\u201d \u201cPolice let THAAD equipment pass through [protesters] by repressing them,\u201d Kang Hyun-wook, a religious leader who was leading the protest, told Yonhap. \u201cThe THAAD deployment is illegal and should be nullified.\u201d Dan Lamothe in Washington and Yoonjung Seo in Seoul contributed to this report.", "qid": 871, "docid": "3efe2fba-2a2a-11e7-86b7-5d31b5fdc114", "score": 10.817000389099121}, {"content": "Title: South Korea says North may be preparing for new rocket launch Content: SEOUL \u2014 Fresh satellite images show increasing activity at North Korea\u2019s launch site, an indication that it could be ready to fire a long-range rocket within several weeks, South Korean officials said Tuesday. \u201cThere is a high possibility\u201d of a launch in December or January, a senior military official told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. The assessment followed the release of an image Monday by DigitalGlobe, which provides satellite imagery to the U.S. government. The image showed people, trucks and fuel tanks at the Sohae launch site, in North Korea\u2019s northwestern corner. The activity, DigitalGlobe said on its Web site, is consistent with preparations in the weeks before Pyongyang\u2019s attempt to launch a long-range missile in April. The family-run police state has said nothing about imminent plans for a launch, and security analysts cautioned that Pyongyang might not go through with a move that would rile its lone benefactor, China, whose Communist Party is breaking in new leadership. But a North Korean delegate told a U.N. General Assembly meeting two weeks ago that the North would expand its space development program and \u201cgo through with launches of working satellites of all kinds essential for the economic development of the country.\u201d North Korea has claimed that previous rocket launches were used to place satellites into orbit. Washington and its allies in East Asia, however, say that such launches are de facto long-range missile tests, because they rely on the same technology. The North is banned under U.N. security resolutions from using \u201cballistic missile technology.\u201d If the North does proceed with a launch, timing will be crucial: It could become either a factor in South Korea\u2019s Dec. 19 presidential election or the first major test for the new leader. For now, North Korea lags far behind the economy as a top concern for South Korean voters. Although both presidential contenders favor a softer approach to the North, liberal candidate Moon Jae-in wants to restore the joint economic projects that were scrapped under the current president, Lee Myung-bak. Moon also has said he will seek summit talks next year. North Korea has tried and failed three times to send a satellite into orbit, most recently on April 13, when the Unha-3 rocket fell apart shortly after launch. The launch had been intended as the showcase moment of a weekend celebrating the 100th birthday of deceased national founder Kim Il Sung. The North is gearing up for another anniversary Dec. 17, which marks one year since the death of Kim Jong Il, who is Kim Il Sung\u2019s son and the father of current supreme leader Kim Jong Eun. **More world news coverage:** \\- Arafat\u2019s remains exhumed for poison probe \\- S.

Here\u2019s how he can respond. Content: Even though his nation continues to live in deep poverty, Kim has been obsessed with enhancing his nuclear weapons arsenal and wants the nation to be recognized as an official nuclear state. Regardless of how South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and the broader international community react to Pyongyang\u2019s ICBM test, Kim has chosen conflict with the rest of the world. Kim\u2019s unprecedented belligerence comes as a surprise to South Korea\u2019s newly inaugurated president, Moon Jae-in. Ushered into office on May 10 following the impeachment of President Park Geun-hye, Moon has long held the belief that greater engagement is the preferred path to lowering inter-Korean tensions. After his election, members of Moon\u2019s Democratic Party declared that a new era in South-North relations was just around the corner. Now, the ICBM missile test has already presented the new president with his first major national security crisis. How he responds is going to define the trajectory of his policy toward North Korea for the rest of his five-year term. Moon now cannot return to the so-called Sunshine Policy of the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations, a policy that advocated sustained dialogue and often ignored the plight of human rights violations in North Korea in the hopes of preventing a nuclearized North Korea. Moon is attending his first Group of 20 summit this week and will hold sideline meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping, among other world leaders. Moon has to show the world that South Korea will not be cowed by North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear threat. He has to affirm to the international community that he can help forge a solid South Korea-U.S. alliance together with a strengthened U.S.-ROK-Japanese security triangle. A holistic response to North Korea\u2019s ICBM capabilities will be the bedrock of his policy toward the North. No one wants another fratricidal war on the Korean Peninsula. But North Korea has become an existential threat to South Korea, the United States and Japan. Deterrence assets must be enhanced. Moreover, secondary sanctions against companies and banks that conduct business with North Korea should be implemented. Finding and closing Kim\u2019s illicit bank accounts in China and Europe, and turning off hard-cash transfers to North Korea from North Korean laborers who are forced to work in inhumane conditions in China, Russia and even the Middle East, will also help. Fundamentally, a successful strategy on North Korea requires a unified stance vis-\u00e0-vis China by the United States, South Korea, Japan and key European states such as Germany, France and Britain \u2014 the latter two being permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. China has been a beneficiary of a belligerent North Korea, using it as a buffer against the United States and its core allies in East Asia.

A failed Russian Mars probe stranded above Earth since November will plunge to its doom this weekend, likely on Sunday. Experts expect the 11 tons of fuel on board to explode high in the atmosphere as friction eats through the craft\u2019s aluminum tanks. But predicting when and where space objects will fall is tricky. Solar flares and other \u201cspace weather\u201d expand and contract Earth\u2019s atmosphere, altering the drag on falling objects. That means the spacecraft, called Phobos-Grunt, could plummet back to Earth over North America, South America, Europe, Asia or even Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to say where the thing is going to fall down,\u201d Heiner Klinkrad, head of the orbital debris office at the European Space Agency in Darmstadt, Germany, said in an interview Friday. Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, expects 500 pounds of the nearly 15-ton craft to survive reentry, with the rest incinerating. The agency\u2019s latest prediction shows it crashing into the Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of South America. But that prediction can change \u2014 and most likely will. As the craft drops lower and lower, its path will become more certain. By late Saturday, Klinkrad said, the ESA will begin crossing out large areas of the world that will not be hit. The ESA\u2019s latest predictions peg the plunge for Sunday morning, Eastern time. But reentry could occur as early as Saturday night or as late as Monday morning, Klinkrad said. The U.S. Strategic Command, the wing of the military tasked with tracking space debris, is also eyeing Sunday and Monday for the uncontrolled reentry. \u201cUnfortunately, we are not 100 percent definite until we don\u2019t see it anymore\u201d on radar screens, said Rodney Ellison, a spokesman for Strategic Command at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha. A joint statement issued Friday by NASA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency said the agencies are \u201cclosely monitoring the situation and are taking all necessary precautions and preparations to be ready to support our federal, state and local partners in the unlikely event that there are impacts to the United States.\u201d The statement urged anyone who finds space debris to contact local law enforcement. Shortly after the Nov. 8 launch of Phobos-Grunt, a booster rocket failed to fire, stranding the probe. Repeated efforts by Roscomos and the ESA to control the craft were unsuccessful. The craft has been slowly dropping, and by Friday, it was just 115 miles high and descending more rapidly as the wispy upper atmosphere tugged on it. Klinkrad said he and his staff will be \u201cworking day and night\u201d to refine the craft\u2019s reentry point. If Phobos-Grunt appears headed for land, the ESA will issue bulletins to its member states informing them of the risk. But odds are high that any debris will plow harmlessly into the ocean. \u201cIn 50 years of modern spaceflight, we have not had one serious injury due to reentering space objects,\u201d Klinkrad said. A few U.S. scientists find themselves in the awkward position of hoping the hardest part of the craft will hit land \u2014 but not hurt anybody, of course. A cone-shaped capsule aboard Phobos-Grunt was designed to survive a fiery reentry. It holds a hardened, hockey-puck-size disk that the Planetary Society filled with hardy microbes and tiny animals called tardigrades, or water bears, to see if the critters might survive the rigors of a 34-month trip to Mars and back. \u201cIf the probe should come in over land, it\u2019s possible the return capsule could survive and be recovered,\u201d said David Warmflash, a scientist who helped design the Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, often called the LIFE experiment.The impending crash adds to concerns about the possible dangers of space debris. Last year, about 70 tons of space junk plummeted to Earth, including NASA\u2019s school bus-size UARS satellite. During the UARS death watch in September, NASA estimated a 1-in-3,200 chance that the satellite could land on somebody. It didn\u2019t. Instead, UARS broke up over the northern Pacific Ocean. The problem of space junk has drawn increasing international attention. In 2007, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space adopted new guidelines for space-faring countries to minimize the dangers of space junk. NASA now designs its satellites with thrusters that can point defunct craft toward the ocean or boost them into orbits so high they will never come back down, said agency spokeswoman Beth Dickey. The Phobos-Grunt mission was supposed to be a technological triumph for Russia. The $163 million craft was to travel to one of the moons of Mars, collect a soil sample (\u201cGrunt\u201d is Russian for \u201cground\u201d) and return the sample to Earth in a hardened capsule. Such a return of a sample from Mars or its moons has never been attempted. It would have been a watershed moment for Russia. Instead, Phobos-Grunt has become a searing embarrassment. The high-profile blunder has spurred Russian space officials to offer increasingly bizarre theories to explain the problem. In an interview published in the Russian newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday, the director of the Russian space agency, Vladimir Popovkin, implied that an anti-satellite weapon may have damaged Phobos-Grunt. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to accuse anybody, but there are very powerful devices that can influence spacecraft now,\u201d Popovkin said. \u201cThe possibility they were used cannot be ruled out.\u201d Other Russian space experts said the cause of the failure was likely much more Earth-bound. \u201cMy strong belief is there are systemic problems in the industry which build spacecraft,\u201d said Anatoly Zak, a Russian space historian and journalist who publishes the Web site RussianSpaceWeb.com. \u201cBefore the launch, I said the chances of mission success were nearly zero.\u201d", "qid": 871, "docid": "98a3a9b2-3e05-11e1-861f-2c3eff5ce2df", "score": 10.646300315856934}, {"content": "Title: Space revolution hatching in a New Zealand paddock Content: The next revolution in space will be launching next year from a field on New Zealand\u2019s South Island. The launch base is New Zealand\u2019s first, and the Rocket Lab spacecraft will be powered by a 3-D-printed engine \u2014 another first. Los Angeles-based Rocket Lab, one of a growing number of businesses aiming to slash the cost of getting into space, is specializing in small satellites. Its 52-foot-tall carbon-cased rocket, being assembled in a small hangar near Auckland Airport, will weigh just 2,600 pounds; with fuel and payload, it will be only about a third the weight of SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 1, which in 2008 became the first privately developed launch vehicle to go into orbit. The remote launch site is no accident. \u201cOne advantage of New Zealand being this little island nation in the middle of nowhere is that\u2019s the perfect place to launch a rocket,\u201d said Rocket Lab\u2019s chief executive, Peter Beck. Ships and planes need rerouting every time a rocket is launched, which limits opportunities in crowded U.S. skies, but New Zealand, with a population of 4 million, has only Antarctica to its south. Rocket Lab, with an investment from Lockheed Martin, is aiming for up to one launch a week as of 2018 at a cost of just under $5 million each \u2014 a tenth of typical launch prices now \u2014 vastly increasing business access to space. Trying to clear its launch backlog, NASA has awarded contracts totaling $17.1 million to Rocket Lab, Firefly Space Systems and Virgin Galactic to launch tiny satellites into orbit beginning in 2017. Rocket Lab recently signed a deal with Silicon Valley-based Moon Express to send a rocket to the moon in 2017 in a bid to win Google\u2019s $20 million Lunar X prize for the first company to send a probe that broadcasts images from the moon. Moon Express has already contracted for five launches with Rocket Lab and plans to send robotic spacecraft continually to the moon for exploration and commercial development of natural resources such as platinum. Bob Richards, chief executive of Moon Express, accepts that there will be glitches and a steep learning curve, but he says that companies such as his are shaping the future as the low-cost launch brings to businesses what used to require the resources of a superpower. \u201cThe emergence of commercial space today will have the same impact as the emergence of commercial aviation did in the early 1900s,\u201d he said. The bread and butter of new launch companies will be small satellites, as players such as Google, Virgin and Samsung plan to carry communications infrastructure and gather data from low-Earth orbit. \u201cWe\u2019re not about building a rocket; we\u2019re about enabling the small-satellite revolution,\u201d Beck said. Three ventures to provide low-cost Internet service from the top of the Himalayas to the middle of the Sahara Desert are being planned by One Web, Samsung and SpaceX, with support from Google. These alone will require 6,000 new satellites in the next four years, Rocket Lab predicts. The Satellite Industry Association says just over 200 satellites were launched in 2014, nearly double the previous year. Not everyone believes there will be enough demand to support the growing number of launch companies. \u201cThe market can\u2019t sustain that many,\u201d said Daniel Lim, vice president of disruptive innovations at TriSept, a space services provider. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a thinning-out of the herd.\u201d Others say a $5 million launch cost is still too high, when companies that can tolerate long waiting lists and don\u2019t need control over timing or trajectory can ride-share on a larger rocket to launch a nano-satellite for $40,000. But space start-ups have been proving popular with investors. \u201cInvestor dollars are increasing their flow,\u201d said Sean Casey, head of Silicon Valley Space Center, a business accelerator for space start-ups. \u201cVenture capitalists are looking for a return on investment and the possibilities of disruptive technologies.\u201d The largest 100 new space companies received more than $2 billion in investment in 2015, around four times more than in 2009, according to data from New Space Global. That is still dwarfed by NASA\u2019s $17.6 billion annual budget, but many say small companies offer options and a risk appetite that government agencies cannot. Sandy Tirtey, a hypersonic engineer who leads the vehicle team at Rocket Lab, used to work for the European Space Agency but lost patience with the red tape required to make small design changes. \u201cI had enough of all these processes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending all day feeding paperwork; we\u2019re spending all day solving problems.\u201d ** \u2014 Reuters **", "qid": 871, "docid": "8895a4fc-8259-11e5-9afb-0c971f713d0c", "score": 10.599300384521484}, {"content": "Title: For once, Trump is right about Obama Content: Every once in a while, as often as a blue moon or a politician forgoing the use of the word \u201cfrankly,\u201d I utter a soft \u201cRight on\u201d in response to something President Trump has done or tweeted. This occurred recently when he took Barack Obama to task for his weak \u2014 and tardy \u2014 response to Russia\u2019s meddling in the U.S. election. For a moment there, Trump forgot that Vladimir Putin can do no wrong. But for that rare moment, the president was absolutely right. The Obama administration\u2019s response to Russian meddling was ineffective and oddly torpid. It was also secretive. For the longest time, only some in the U.S. intelligence community and a few people in the Obama White House knew what the Kremlin was up to. Most of Congress, not to mention the American people, were kept in the dark. Why? After all, it was our election. Of course, Trump had his own harebrained take on what happened and who might have benefited. Somehow, Obama\u2019s weak response to the Russians was supposed to benefit Hillary Clinton. If anything, Putin had become a virtual Trump volunteer, all but chanting \u201cLock her up, lock her up,\u201d in the safe space created by thick Kremlin walls. Putin had come to hate Clinton for her statements questioning the legitimacy of his own election. One does not question Putin\u2019s legitimacy. He has that in common with Trump. Russian meddling in the 2016 election has produced a very rare bipartisan approach to a foreign policy challenge, combining incompetence (Obama) with chaotic indifference (Trump) so that Putin has been allowed to mess with our election with close to impunity. Oh, two Russian rest houses in Maryland and New York were closed, some intelligence operatives operating under diplomatic cover were given the boot, and additional sanctions were imposed, but mostly this caper was widely successful. It may not be true that Russia managed to fiddle with the vote; Moscow did, however, mess with Clinton\u2019s head, employing WikiLeaks to keep her off-balance. The Obama administration\u2019s response to Russian meddling was entirely characteristic of a president who was respected by many but feared by few. When Obama finally approached Putin at a summit in Hangzhou, China, and reportedly told him he\u2019d \u201cbetter stop or else,\u201d Putin essentially blew him off. He demanded proof. As Putin no doubt knew, red lines with Obama were opportunities for further study. But Obama is no longer president. Some of the tougher penalties Obama ordered up but never used are on Trump\u2019s desk. Yet the new president continued to dismiss the unanimous finding of the entire U.S. intelligence community that Russia meddled in the election. Trump variously called the whole thing \u201ca hoax\u201d and said that maybe it wasn\u2019t the Russians but \u201csome guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d (Chris Christie? Tony Soprano?) Actually, it was some guy at home in the Kremlin. The question is: What is Trump going to do about it? And the further question is: Why does the answer appear to be nothing? Can it be that he actually thinks the story was concocted by all 17 intelligence agencies? Can it be that he is somehow so indebted to Putin that his hands are tied and his mouth muzzled? And what could so compromise the president of the United States? Does he owe rubles to the Russians? Did the Russians catch Trump on tape reading a history book? He would, of course, be destroyed. As always with Trump, the Republican Party has taken a stand on principle that it will have none. The Russians violated American sovereignty, and few in the GOP protest. The man in the Oval Office appears either inhibited or so befogged by keen feelings of victimization, that the United States \u2014 the world\u2019s sole superpower, remember? \u2014 cannot respond to what amounts to an attack on our way of life. There was yet another moment when I cheered Trump. That was in April when he authorized the missile strike on a Syrian air base after its military had used chemical weapons on civilians. He did what Obama had refused to do, he did it without months of study \u2014 and it was successful. He now has the credibility that unfortunately matters in the schoolyard of international affairs \u2014 the willingness to use force. I am not suggesting that he do something similar to Russia \u2014 it is a nuclear power, after all \u2014 but I am suggesting that he do _something_ or explain, in possibly more than 140 characters, why he will not. In the meantime, the United States appears weak.

But even as Trump sought to use his proximity to world leaders ahead of the Group of 20 summit here to rally allies, the White House faced firm opposition from Russia and China over any retaliatory measures on Pyongyang. Asked by a reporter at a photo op whether he had lost faith in Beijing, Trump replied: \u201cNever give up.\u201d But he did not respond to a follow-up question about whether he has been disappointed in China\u2019s inability to constrain North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un. Earlier in the day, during a news conference in Warsaw before his arrival in Germany, Trump called North Korea\u2019s successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile \u201cvery, very bad behavior.\u201d \u201cSomething will have to be done about it,\u201d he said, though he did not offer details about what responses his administration was considering. The Trump administration\u2019s effort to forge consensus among members of the U.N. Security Council appears to have hit a wall, given the opposition in Moscow and Beijing to additional economic sanctions or potential U.S. military actions against Pyongyang. New sanctions would have little effect unless backed by China, which is North Korea\u2019s financial lifeline. Trump had a 75-minute meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a bid to put the two U.S. allies on the same page as Washington. Norio Maruyama, a Japanese government spokesman, told reporters in Hamburg that the conversation was \u201cvery vivid\u201d and that the only topic on the agenda was North Korea. The three leaders agreed that China should do more to rein in North Korea\u2019s \u201cprovocative\u201d behavior, Maruyama said. Abe emphasized that \u201cholding dialogue for the sake of dialogue with North Korea is meaningless,\u201d Maruyama said. He added that the Japanese leader believes that \u201cit would be essential to put pressure on North Korea to make it engage in dialogue seriously.\u201d Maruyama said the issue of military action was not discussed with any specificity. \u201cGreat trilateral meeting & dinner,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter, including a photo of him flanked by Moon and Abe. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attended the meeting with Trump, along with other U.S. officials. Their discussion came a day before Trump was to hold his first bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, on Friday in Hamburg. Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday that the launch of the ICBM does not alone bring the United States closer to war. Mattis described ongoing efforts to pressure North Korea as \u201cpurely diplomatically led\u201d with a focus on economic sanctions. \u201cDiplomacy has not failed,\u201d Mattis said. It is U.S. self-restraint that has prevented \u201cwar in the face of provocations,\u201d he said, \u201cbut our self-restraint holds, and diplomatic efforts remain underway as we speak.\u201d Mattis said the United States is still analyzing the reentry vehicle in the ICBM launched this week. U.S. defense against North Korean missiles are sufficient, and the United States knew quickly that the missile had been launched, he said. \u201cWe assume these sorts of things from him,\u201d Mattis said of North Korea\u2019s leader. \u201cWe were on duty. As you all know, the radars were up and operating.\u201d Pentagon officials this week have sought to underscore that the ICBM threat posed by North Korea is \u201cnascent\u201d and that Pyongyang has a long way to go in terms of understanding the trajectory of the missiles and reentry before they could hit North America. While the Trump administration has said that all options are on the table to counter North Korea, Mattis has previously warned that an armed conflict would include \u201cprobably the worst kind of fighting in most people\u2019s lifetime,\u201d citing the threat posed by hundreds of North Korean rocket launchers and artillery pieces aimed at Seoul. The Pentagon and State Department have not taken steps that would indicate U.S. officials are seriously concerned that the situation is an immediate crisis, such as sending home the families of U.S. service members and State Department employees stationed in South Korea. At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley accused China and Russia of \u201cholding the hands\u201d of the North Korean leader. Her words were met with criticism from Vladimir Safronkov, Russia\u2019s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, who called stricter sanctions \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and military action \u201cinadmissible.\u201d At a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry backed him up, calling for calm in response to U.S. remarks. After his first meeting with Xi in April, Trump emerged professing confidence that China would pressure Pyongyang to stop testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. That plan, as he recently tweeted, \u201chas not worked out.\u201d But U.S. tough talk seems unlikely to bring Beijing on its side, experts said. The U.S. response to the ICBM test so far has encompassed joint military exercises with the South Koreans, calls for stricter sanctions on those doing business with North Korea and high-level warnings of military action \u2014 all of which are at odds with Chinese plans. It\u2019s not that China does not care about the North Korean threat \u2014 it does \u2014 but that it sees it differently, analysts said. Beijing and Pyongyang were once communist brothers-in-arms at war with American forces. Those days are long gone, but the memory of the 1950-1953 Korean War looms large. The fact that thousands of U.S. troops are still stationed in South Korea is a sore point for the Chinese, which would rather not have the American military at their doorstep. Beijing often sees U.S. moves in South Korea, from joint exercises to missile defense, as maneuvers designed to counter Chinese military might. Indeed, the \u201cdouble suspension\u201d plan pitched by China and Russia in the wake of the ICBM test calls for the United States and South Korea to suspend joint military exercises and for North Korea to freeze its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Over the years, Trump has said repeatedly that China is the key to squeezing the regime into submission. However, China does not appear willing to topple Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s not very likely that China will follow the will of the U.S. and put a \u2018heavy move\u2019 on North Korea, like what President Trump has called for,\u201d said Deng Yuwen, a Beijing-based expert on North Korea. \u201cIt would expand sanctions, but there is a bottom line, and the bottom line is that it won\u2019t sanction North Korea such that it causes chaos in the North,\u201d he added. Lastly, Beijing does not have the same sense of urgency when it comes to North Korea. China has always been in reach of North Korea\u2019s military, so the development of an ICBM is not as much of a game-changer. Plus, China\u2019s leadership remains focused on domestic issues, namely key political meetings set for the fall, said Michael Kovrig, a Beijing-based senior adviser for the International Crisis Group, and officials are unlikely to make any move that could threaten their bases of support. \u201cChinese analysts continue to argue that no amount of pressure, short of what might cause a collapse, will bring North Korea to denuclearize,\u201d Kovrig said. \u201cBeijing\u2019s prescription is still to coax rather than to pressure. Unlike the U.S., it\u2019s not in a hurry and hopes that economic incentives can gradually induce Pyongyang to moderate its behavior.\u201d Rauhala, Luna Lin and Shirley Feng reported from Beijing.

A State Department official said Monday that the United States will continue trying to further isolate North Korea economically, politically and diplomatically. The pressure will keep ratcheting up until Pyongyang stops conducting missile tests and demonstrates that it is willing to engage in negotiations, said Susan Thornton, the acting assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for some kind of signal that they realize the current status quo is unsustainable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to make a final decision about getting rid of illegal programs in order to turn the page and have a more normal relationship with the international community.\u201d \u201cWe have not seen that signal,\u201d she added. Pence arrived in South Korea just hours after North Korea launched its latest ballistic missile \u2014 which exploded within a few seconds \u2014 and amid a weekend of fanfare in North Korea, during which the regime showed off what appeared to be new missiles designed to reach the United States. There, during a trip to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and later in remarks to journalists, he issued strong warnings to Pyongyang. \u201cJust in the past two weeks, the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in Syria and Afghanistan,\u201d Pence said after delivering a statement to the news media alongside Hwang Kyo-ahn, South Korea\u2019s acting president. Neither took questions. \u201cNorth Korea would do well not to test his resolve or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region,\u201d Pence said. __ Earlier this month, on Trump\u2019s command, the U.S. militarylaunched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian military airfield in retaliation for a chemical attack that killed scores of civilians. Then, less than a week later, the U.S. military dropped a 22,000-pound bomb \u2014 the largest \u00adnon-nuclear bomb ever used in combat by the United States \u2014 on Islamic State forces in eastern Afghanistan. With Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime conducting a steady stream of ballistic missile launches and signs of activity around its nuclear test site, the Trump administration has raised the rhetoric on possible military action to stop it in its tracks. But any strikes against the North would probably bring the United States into a diplomatic crisis with China, the North\u2019s main economic lifeline. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang called for international talks with North Korea to ease tensions. Russia, too, warned that the Trump administration was on what Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called a \u201cvery risky path.\u201d \u201cI hope there will be no unilateral actions like those we saw recently in Syria,\u201d Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. Both Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who visited South Korea last month, and Pence have stated that \u201cstrategic patience\u201d \u2014 the Obama-era policy of putting pressure on North Korea and waiting for it to return to negotiations \u2014 is over and that military action is an option to make North Korea desist. The U.S. Navy\u2019s decision to reroute an aircraft carrier strike group destined for Australia to the \u201cwestern Pacific\u201d sparked speculation it was heading to the Korean Peninsula, adding to the jitters in the region. The strike group left Singapore on April 8. Photos released by the Navy on Saturday showed that the carrier passed north through the Sunda Strait, the passage between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java \u2014 about 3,500 miles from the Korean Peninsula, Defense News reported. The Navy declined to give The Washington Post a more precise location than the \u201cwestern Pacific\u201d except to rule out the waters around South Korea or Japan. \u201cAs our secretary of defense made clear here in South Korea not that long ago,\u201d Pence said Monday, \u201cwe will defeat any attack, and we will meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective response.\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Seoul in February. _ _Hwang, the acting president until the election to replace Park Geun-hye, said South Korea would \u201censure the early deployment and operation\u201d of an American-backed anti-ballistic missile system called Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). The plan has been controversial in South Korea, with some worried that it would make the South more of a target for North Korean missiles and others concerned about economic revenge being exacted by China. The front-runner to replace Park in a snap presidential election to be held May 9, progressive politician Moon Jae-in, has promised to review the previous government\u2019s decision to host THAAD. __Beijing strongly objects to the antimissile system because it worries that the United States will use its batteries\u2019 associated radar to snoop on China.

Korea\u2019s new leader orders probe of US missile launchers Content: SEOUL \u2014 Calling it a \u201cvery shocking\u201d incident, South Korea\u2019s new president on Tuesday demanded an investigation into why his office was not told by defense officials about the arrival of several additional launchers for a contentious U.S. missile defense system meant to cope with North Korea\u2019s nuclear threat. Before taking office May 10, Moon Jae-in vowed to review the deployment of a system that has infuriated North Korea and China, which consider its powerful radar a security threat. Many of Moon\u2019s supporters do not want the system, which President Trump has suggested Seoul should pay for. On Tuesday, senior presidential adviser Yoon Young-chan said Moon discovered that four additional launchers for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system had arrived in South Korea since the original two launchers were installed in April. Yoon said senior Defense Ministry officials did not report the arrival of the additional launchers when they briefed Moon\u2019s policy advisory committee Thursday. \u201cPresident Moon said it\u2019s \u2018very shocking\u2019 after receiving a report\u201d on the incident from his national security director, Yoon said at a news conference. Moon, a liberal, is working with cabinet members appointed by his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, who was ousted from office in March over a corruption scandal. Moon has nominated some of his own cabinet members, but they have not formally taken office. Moon was sworn in as president after winning a May 9 special election and has not had the usual two-month transition period. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency cited an unidentified Defense Ministry official as saying the ministry told Moon\u2019s national security director about the four launchers the day after the policy briefing. But Yonhap said the president\u2019s office denied that. A THAAD battery consists of six truck-mounted launchers that can fire up to 48 interceptor missiles. It also includes a powerful type of radar, officially known as AN/TPY-2. The THAAD system was installed in the town of Seongju. It is unclear whether Moon will go ahead with his campaign pledge to reexamine the THAAD deployment, because a request for the withdrawal of the system\u2019s components could severely undermine ties with Washington, Seoul\u2019s most important ally, \u00adanalysts say. The United States stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea as deterrence against potential aggression from North Korea. Since Moon\u2019s inauguration, North Korea has test-fired three ballistic missiles in an apparent demonstration of its resolve to bolster its nuclear and missile arsenals to deal with what it calls U.S. military threats.", "qid": 871, "docid": "659ddbe6-4566-11e7-bcde-624ad94170ab", "score": 10.210100173950195}, {"content": "Title: Russia asserting itself against West, this time over Syria regime change Content: UNITED NATIONS \u2014 With the United States and its allies pressing President Bashar al-Assad to step down, the Arab League last week issued a detailed plan for a political transition in Syria. The plan was welcomed by the Obama administration, and Arab leaders quickly said they would refer it to the United Nations. And a day later, Russia had its say: Not a chance. \u201cThis is an effort from the Arab League, if I understand correctly, to sort of already put a precooked solution on the table,\u201d said Vitaly I. Churkin, Moscow\u2019s envoy to the United Nations. \u201cI understand that the attitude of Damascus to that has been negative.\u201d The response doomed any hope of a quick resolution at the United Nations to bring greater pressure to bear on the Syrian government, but it also fell into a familiar pattern by which Moscow has shown a growing willingness to challenge the United States and its European partners on a range of issues. In recent weeks, Moscow has sought U.N. scrutiny of possible crimes by NATO during its air campaign in Libya, and even called for investigations into organ sales in Kosovo, a close ally of the West. Most notably, Moscow has obstructed any effort to increase pressure on Iran. Asked in an interview whether Russia would ever support a U.N. resolution imposing economic sanctions on the Islamic republic, Churkin said: \u201cNo chance, no chance, no chance. . . . Ever.\u201d Critics say Moscow\u2019s tough line at the United Nations reflects what one senior council diplomat described as \u201cthe Putinization of Russian foreign policy,\u201d on the eve of what many expect will be the return of Vladimir Putin to the presidency. Other analysts say Russia is trying to reassert its authority in the council following a period in which the United States and Europe prevailed in the handling of several major crises, engineering the downfall of former Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo and, more recently, of Moammar Gaddafi in Libya. \u201cThe Russians looked diminished in the first half of 2011, and the strategy is to show, one, they are prepared to act as a spoiler, but, two, they can also lay out a more proactive agenda,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations at the New York University Center for International Cooperation. The United States and its European partners have responded to Russian aims by mounting a campaign to isolate it at the United Nations, and portraying Moscow as an obstacle to the democratic changes sweeping through the Middle East. This past week, for example, the United States, Britain, Germany and France publicly rebuked Syria\u2019s arms suppliers, a veiled reference to Russia, for continuing to sell weapons to Damascus. \u201cIt is glaringly obvious that transferring weapons into a volatile and violent situation is irresponsible and will only fuel the bloodshed,\u201d Britain\u2019s U.N. envoy, Mark Lyall Grant, told the Security Council. Russia is coming under mounting pressure to break with Assad from the Arab League, which is sending a delegation to the Security Council on Tuesday to press its case for a political transition that would require that the Syrian leader step aside. Meanwhile, Morocco, acting on behalf of a group of Western and Arab governments, has introduced a draft resolution endorsing the Arab League initiative calling on states to follow the Arab organization\u2019s example by imposing sanctions on Syria. The Russians have responded coolly. The high-level diplomatic gamesmanship is playing out as violence continues to spiral in Syria, forcing the United States to prepare for the possible closure of its embassy and the evacuation of its diplomatic personnel. U.N. officials estimate that more than 5,400 civilians have been killed, mostly at the hands of government security forces, since protesters took to the streets earlier last year. Russia\u2019s stance underscores the strength and depth of its relationship with Assad\u2019s regime, which is not only a recipient of Russian arms but also host of a Russian naval base. The crisis in Syria also has provided Moscow with an opportunity to show it is a more reliable ally than Western powers, particularly the United States, which is seen by many in the region as having abandoned one of its closest allies, former Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak. \u201cIf you have good relations with a country, a government for years, for decades, then it\u2019s not so easy to ditch those politicians and those governments because of political expediency,\u201d Churkin said. \u201cWe are stronger on our allegiances than others.\u201d Tensions between the West and Russia have spilled over into a series of highly personal attacks at the United Nations. Last month, U.S. Ambassador Susan E. Rice derided Churkin\u2019s appeal for a new probe into possible NATO killings as a \u201ccheap stunt\u201d aimed at distracting attention from the killing in Syria. Churkin fired back at the Stanford-educated envoy, saying, \u201cReally this Stanford dictionary of expletives must be replaced by something more Victorian.\u201d Rice\u2019s media spokesman posted a tweet with a photoshopped picture of Churkin on the head of \u201cthe Grinch Who Stole Christmas.\u201d Asked if he was trying to change the subject from Syria, Churkin acknowledged that the Security Council has been the scene of \u201cgames of distraction,\u201d but he said Russia\u2019s concerns about the Libya mission were legitimate, asserting that the killing of civilians during the NATO campaign was \u201ca real issue.\u201d Russia, along with Brazil, China, India and South Africa, believe \u201cit would be extremely dangerous if\u201d the West continues to be \u201ccarried away by this regime-change idea,\u201d he said. In Syria, Russia has pursued a complicated diplomatic strategy to shore up the regime, joining China in vetoing the Western-backed resolution threatening sanctions against Damascus, and introducing its own resolution. That resolution, now stalled, sought to focus the Security Council\u2019s energy on backing a political settlement between the Syrian government and the opposition, and cutting off military supplies to the opposition. Under the resolution, Assad\u2019s army could still be armed. Asked if Russia\u2019s ongoing arms sales to Assad\u2019s government were perhaps undercutting his government\u2019s effort to pursue a political settlement, Churkin said: \u201cWe are not doing anything which is contrary to international law. Other than that, we don\u2019t have to give any explanation to anybody.\u201d More world news coverage: Arab League halts observer mission in Syria Former 'Sons of Iraq' targeted by insurgents after U.S. pullout Yemen's Saleh reportedly arrives in U.S.", "qid": 871, "docid": "cc3996ae-4839-11e1-bfd9-c630ec256905", "score": 10.183099746704102}, {"content": "Title: China launches \u2018Jade Rabbit\u2019 rover to moon, precursor to manned mission Content: BEIJING \u2014 China took a significant step toward eventually landing a person on the moon with Monday\u2019s successful launch of a rocket carrying its first moon rover, the \u201cJade Rabbit.\u201d The rocket blasted off from southwestern China at 1:30 a.m. Monday, a day after India\u2019s maiden Mars mission left Earth\u2019s orbit on its journey to the Red Planet, in what some observers characterize as Asia\u2019s new space race. China\u2019s rocket is expected to deposit the rover in the right eye of the \u201cMan in the Moon\u201d in mid-December, targeting a large volcanic crater known as the Sinus Iridum or the Bay of Rainbows, thought to be relatively free of large rocks. If the mission succeeds, China will become the third country to achieve a soft landing on the moon, after the United States and Russia. The last soft landing on the moon was the unmanned Soviet Luna 24 rover, which collected soil samples in 1976. \u201cWe will strive for our space dream as part of the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation,\u201d said Zhang Zhenshong, director of the Xichang Satellite Launch Center, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Zhang was echoing President Xi Jinping, who has made the \u201cChinese dream\u201d one of his key motifs. The rover, called \u201cYutu\u201d in Chinese, is named after a Chinese myth about a woman named Chang\u2019e who swallowed magic pills and took her pet rabbit to the moon, where she has been living as a goddess ever since. The rover will set up a telescope on the moon for the first time, survey its geological structure and look for natural resources through a radar, Xinhua reported. China aims to follow the United States by landing a man on the moon \u2014 though it has yet to set a target date for that mission \u2014 and to continue toward Mars. \u201cChina\u2019s space exploration will not stop at the moon,\u201d Sun Huixian, a senior engineer in the space program, told Xinhua. \u201cOur target is deep space.\u201d India, Japan and Russia also are giving serious thought to manned missions to the moon in the 2020s. Chinese scientists and experts frame the space program partially in terms of their nation\u2019s constant quest for energy and raw materials, talking about \u00adhelium-3 and solar power as potential energy sources on the moon, as well as its reserves of titanium, rare earths, uranium and thorite. \u201cNow nobody is exploiting the resources because the economic costs are too high,\u201d Ouyang Ziyuan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told Xinhua. \u201cThis is a possibility in the future, and humans should know what is there on the moon.\u201d Chinese officials denied that they were in competition with India or other nations and have offered to cooperate with other countries. Since 2011, the U.S. Congress has banned NASA from using federal funds to cooperate with China or Chinese companies. Some U.S. scientists say the Chinese mission is not likely to add much to what is already known about the moon. In a recent article in Aerospace America magazine, unidentified U.S. scientists said the Chinese rover design was similar to NASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Rover and that, apart from the Chinese radar system, many instruments were similar to those previously carried by U.S. and Russian space missions. However, the mission does represent a breakthrough in China\u2019s space program, and it shows that the country is making progress toward landing a person on the moon. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, has urged NASA to cooperate with China, perhaps collaborating to land a person on Mars. \u201cThe Chang\u2019e 3 details tell me that the U.S. now absolutely must start communicating with the Chinese about lunar cooperation,\u201d he told Aerospace America.

But at a rare news conference afterward, China\u2019s new premier, Li Keqiang, parried reporters\u2019 efforts to get specifics on how the new administration would accomplish those goals, sticking largely to vows to reform. The news conference \u2014 held annually at the close of the National People\u2019s Congress \u2014 drew widespread attention because it is one of the only times each year when China\u2019s top leaders open themselves to public questioning. Even as Xi and Li are trying to project an image of new transparency, there are clear limits to that effort, as Sunday\u2019s news conference showed. All questions at the news conference were carefully pre-screened, and answers were apparently prepared well in advance. The premier was asked about China\u2019s increasing problems with pollution, its widely despised labor camps, its economic slowdown and rampant problems with corruption. The corruption question yielded one of the few detailed responses at the event, with Li saying the new administration planned to further curb signs of ostentation by building no new ornate government buildings and decreasing official receptions and visits abroad. \u201cReform is about curbing government power. It is a self-imposed revolution,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt will require real sacrifice, and it will be painful, like cutting the wrist. But this is necessary for development and demanded by people.\u201d He also invoked repeatedly the importance of the rule of law, acknowledging a common complaint among citizens about a judicial system that critics say is often decided by personal contacts rather than what is right. On a question about pollution and environmental safety \u2014 on a particularly hazy day and after more than 12,000 pigs were mysteriously found dead in rivers that provide drinking water to Shanghai \u2014 Li said the pollution \u201cdepressed\u201d him and that economic growth should not be pursued at the expense of the environment. Li dismissed one reporter\u2019s question about U.S. charges of official Chinese involvement in hacking American companies and government agencies to carry out cyber-espionage. He called the charges \u201cgroundless accusations,\u201d and he repeated long-standing bromides about the U.S.-China relationship, saying it should stress mutual interests rather than differences. Those differences are likely to come up later this week when U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew visits China, with the topic of recent cyberattacks on U.S. companies likely unavoidable. At the conclusion of the two-hour news conference, Li acknowledged general alarm from other countries at China\u2019s rise. They are worried about the sustainability of China\u2019s growth and its possible use of force and hegemony, he said, referring indirectly to China\u2019s pollution and its increasingly aggressive posture in the region. He tried to allay those fears, saying China would not \u201cforce on others what we don\u2019t want ourselves.\u201d But for the most part, the comments by the premier and president seemed geared to domestic concerns. Xi has talked repeatedly in recent months of pursuing a new \u201cChinese dream,\u201d which he has often characterized in terms of the nation as a whole \u2014 a common theme for a Communist government that emphasizes the collective. But in Sunday\u2019s speech, Xi linked that dream more closely to improving the lives of individuals. \u201cChinese people living in our great motherland and this great era shall share the chance of living a splendid life, share the chance of realizing the dream, share the chance of growing and improving along with the motherland,\u201d he said. Public reaction to both leaders included praise for how they handled themselves, mixed with healthy doses of skepticism about their sincerity. \u201cXi Jinping and Li Keqiang look smart and pragmatic, more and more like Western politicians,\u201d noted one microblogger under the handle Bright New Moon. \u201cRight now, we listen more to what they say than we observe what they do. . . .

He ticked off a list of recent U.S. weather disasters \u2014 from Hurricane Sandy to record droughts in the West \u2014 as evidence that the once-distant threat of climate change has \u201cmoved firmly into the present.\u201d Obama was one of scores of heads of state to address the U.N. summit, convened by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to pressure the world\u2019s industrialized countries ahead of a round of climate negotiations scheduled for late next year in Paris. Previous efforts failed to yield a global deal on cutting carbon emissions, in part because of differences between developing countries and the industrialized nations historically responsible for the bulk of the pollutants in the atmosphere. But in recent years, China has overtaken the United States as the largest single emitter of greenhouse gases. Obama reiterated his commitment to seeking an \u201cambitious\u201d global pact on climate change even while acknowledging heavy political resistance in the United States, where Congress repeatedly has voiced opposition to binding limits on carbon emissions. He said Washington and Beijing bear special responsibility for reducing carbon pollution, but he added: \u201cNo one gets a pass.\u201d \u201cWe can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined by every nation,\u201d he said. Obama touted his administration\u2019s achievements in lowering pollution, pointing to a drop in U.S. emissions to 20-year-lows and sharp increases in solar and wind energy production. Early next year, he said, the White House will announce plans for further cuts, made possible in part by tougher fuel-economy standards for American automobiles and proposed new restrictions on carbon emissions from utility plants. But he said the administration simultaneously must take steps to prepare for climatic changes that already have started to emerge, particularly rising sea levels and more intense weather events. He said the administration would revise its foreign aid guidelines to factor in the effect of weather disasters tied to global warming. The White House also pledged to expand access to weather data and forecasting technology to enable developing countries to prepare better for storms. \u201cNo matter what we do, some populations will still be at risk,\u201d he said. China\u2019s Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, speaking after Obama, said his country was willing to do more to lower emissions. \u201cChina is ready to work with other countries and to shoulder its responsibilities,\u201d he said.

In the three months since Park was suspended over corruption allegations, plunging the country into limbo amid protracted impeachment proceedings, the regime in North Korea has launched five ballistic missiles and a volley of threats, and is accused of ordering the assassination of the leader\u2019s half brother. Add to that China\u2019s anger over the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system to South Korea and uncertainty about President Trump\u2019s administration in Washington, and the lack of leadership in South Korea could hardly have come at a more sensitive time. \u201cA political vacuum like this in a key ally that borders a major nuclear threat is not good for the U.S.,\u201d said John Delury, an American political scientist in Seoul. \u201cI think it\u2019s been underestimated as a danger and as a destabilizing factor.\u201d Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will encounter this problem firsthand when he arrives in Seoul next week for discussions about North Korea with a South Korean counterpart who is on his way out. Tillerson will also hear about the rise of a progressive candidate whose approach toward China and North Korea could differ sharply from that of the impeached president \u2014 and from the stance of the United States. The Trump administration is conducting a policy review to decide how to deal with North Korea\u2019s threats, and there is plenty of talk in Washington about \u201ckinetic options\u201d \u2014 a euphemism for some kind of military action. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, some ruling-party lawmakers are openly pushing for Japan to develop the capacity to preemptively strike North Korea. That is the kind of talk that South Korea should be shutting down, Delury said. In addition to its nuclear and missile programs, North Korea has conventional artillery lined up along the demilitarized zone and aimed at Seoul, a metropolis of 25 million people. \u201cThe role of a South Korean president, whether liberal or conservative, is to be the person who gently takes that option off the table,\u201d Delury said, referring to a preemptive strike. \u201cThe South Korean president has to be saying, \u2018If you take out their missile pad, they take out our capital.\u2019 But that hasn\u2019t been happening.\u201d Park was immediately dismissed from office Friday after South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld a legislative impeachment motion, ruling unanimously that she had \u201ccontinuously\u201d broken the law. Elections will be held in early May, and the latest opinion polls show Moon Jae-in, a progressive who unsuccessfully challenged Park for the presidency in 2012, holding a strong lead. Moon favors the \u201csunshine policy\u201d of engagement with North Korea \u2014 the liberal idea from the late 1990s that engagement can help open up the closed state and narrow the gap between the two Koreas. This sunshine policy ended in 2008 with the election of a conservative president who took a tough approach toward North Korea, a stance maintained by Park. Following North Korea\u2019s nuclear test at the beginning of last year, Park\u2019s government closed the inter-Korean industrial complex that was the linchpin of the sunshine policy, accusing the North of using South Korean cash from economic engagement projects to bankroll its weapons programs. Moon, however, has said he would like to resume engagement with North Korea and would go to Pyongyang for talks with its leader. \u201cIf Moon wins the general election, he will emphasize South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. and a strong defense posture,\u201d said Lee Chung-min, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University. \u201cBut his heart will lie in fostering deeper engagement with the North and negotiating an early summit with Kim Jong Un.\u201d Moon has also signaled an openness to reviewing the Park government\u2019s agreement to host the United States\u2019 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile battery. The agreement was reached last year to protect against North Korean missiles, and the system was due to arrive in South Korea this summer. But in a surprise announcement, the Pentagon said the first shipment arrived in South Korea on Monday. This has sparked widespread speculation in South Korea that the United States expected Park to be impeached and wanted to make the deployment more difficult to reverse. The U.S. military command in South Korea said the deployment was being carried out according to schedule. China has vehemently objected to the arrival of THAAD in the region, viewing the deployment as a U.S. attempt to keep China, not just North Korea, in check. To prod Seoul to change its mind, Beijing has imposed painful restrictions on South Korean imports ranging from toilet seats to pop music. \u201cWe are all very clear that the crux of the problem between China and South Korea is that South Korea is ignoring China\u2019s concerns and is deploying the THAAD antimissile system with the United States,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday. \u201cWe once again urge South Korea to focus on the interests of the Chinese and Korean people,\u201d he said. But analysts say that even if the progressive Moon becomes South Korea\u2019s next president, he will face difficulties in backtracking on THAAD or returning to the sunshine policy. \u201cWhile China might expect a U-turn over THAAD if Moon becomes president, it will be extremely difficult for Moon to do that, since THAAD is being placed primarily for the defense of the United States forces in Korea,\u201d said Lee, the Yonsei professor. Trump could seek to dissuade Moon by making South Korea pay more for its defense costs and speeding up efforts to renegotiate the Korea-U.S. free-trade agreement. \u201cDespite Moon\u2019s inclination to oppose THAAD deployment, he will not undo it at the expense of worsening ties with Trump just as Moon begins his term in office,\u201d Lee said. Likewise, it would be difficult to go back to the kind of sunshine policy of previous liberal presidents, said Robert Kelly of Pusan National University. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is much support for major engagement any more,\u201d he said. This is partly because public opinion has changed dramatically, thanks to two North Korean attacks in 2010 that left more than 50 South Koreans dead, as well as the Park government\u2019s assertion that engagement money was funding weapons development. \u201cI think Moon would have to fight hard to get that kind of engagement off the ground \u2014 he\u2019d be pushing against the Americans and against his own people,\u201d Kelly said.

He focused the lens on the big, bright planet and several stars nearby, marked the position of all four bodies in his notes, then continued his sweep of the night skies. The following evening, when he returned his gaze to the same spot, he found something peculiar: The stars had moved. They appeared to be following Jupiter \u2014 almost as though they were moons in orbit around it. But that was impossible. Never before had stargazers found a planet with moons. It had been established by Ptolemy more than 1,000 years ago that everything in the universe orbited the Earth. Sure, there was that upstart Copernicus, who said that the Sun was actually at the center of things. But few people believed him. If Galileo was a Copernican, he was a closeted one. \"It was the beginning of the modern understanding of the universe.\" Four centuries later, scientists are returning to Jupiter to deepen that understanding. NASA's space probe Juno, which slipped into orbit around Jupiter as the glow of the last fireworks of July 4 faded away, carries instruments aimed at elucidating the history of our solar system. Spectrometers will seek out chemical signatures of the gases that existed when the planets were newborn; a microwave radiometer will measure the presence of water \u2014 seeking hints at the origins of this essential ingredient for life. But there are also several non-scientific pieces of cargo onboard the probe, including a tiny, aluminium Lego figurine of Galileo and a plaque bearing his first observations of Jupiter's largest moons. \"My guess is that he would have thought [the Lego figures] were pretty kitsch,\" he said. Either way, the astronomer probably would have demanded some sort of recognition of his discoveries. \"He thought they were the greatest thing ever,\" Heilbron said. \"Galileo was not a modest man. Nor had he any reason to be.\" But on that night in 1610, when he first directed his gaze toward Jupiter, Galileo was pretty much a nobody. He was employed as a mathematics professor at the University of Padua \u2014 a rather lowly position in an era when philosophy was considered the queen of the sciences. In the world view of Renaissance Europe, math was only useful as a tool for astrologers, who needed to predict the positions of the planets in order to divine the best days for weddings and wars. Scientists at the time believed that \"philosophy described the world as it really is,\" according to Wootton. \"Whereas math just told you what is possible.\" Regardless, math is a lot more useful than metaphysics when you're trying to build a telescope, which is exactly what Galileo was working on at the turn of the 17th century. By day, he taught the dubious science of astrology and Ptolemaic astronomy to his students; by night, he struggled to gain an ever-sharper view of the stars. The telescope he'd perfected at the start of 1610 was the best of its time, and it revealed things never before seen by a human eye: craters on the Moon, individual stars that made up the Milky Way. The findings reported in Galileo's slim little pamphlet were met first with incredulity, then with awe as more and more astronomers verified Galileo's claims. According to Heilbron, the English ambassador to Italy had a copy sent to his king, with an accompanying note calling it \"the strangest and most wonderful thing that had ever been announced anywhere.\" \"Very quickly there were people calling Galileo the Columbus of the heavens,\" Heilbron said. \"Independent of the question of whether the Earth goes round the sun or vice versa, he had achieved the most remarkable reworking of the heavens since the time of Adam. These were things that were not available to the naked eye.\" Galileo himself was mostly silent about the true significance of the discovery: that Earth was not the only thing in the universe around which objects could revolve. Historians still debate whether he already believed Copernicus's theories \u2014 if he did, he was not ready to say so publicly. But censorship and imprisonment could not stop what Galileo helped start. Wootton argues that Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's moons launched not just modern astronomy, but modern science as a whole. \"It was the beginning of a new understanding of what science is supposed to be about, which is making discoveries using new techniques, and developing those techniques,\" he said. This has been a guiding principle of everything that came after, from the development of microscopes to examine Earth's smallest creatures to the construction of spacecraft that can probe the secrets of the solar system. When Wootton heard about the aluminum Galileo figurine onboard Juno, he laughed with delight. \"I think that's wonderful,\" he said. \"When Galileo writes that his book is a 'messenger from the stars,' he's imagining space travel. He sees the telescope as something that allows you to do virtual space travel.\" Regardless of the aesthetics of a little Lego character, \"he would have been thrilled at the idea that his own name would have been carried to the stars.\"", "qid": 871, "docid": "8fc729b87460fd7025a6a7c4b1fe7d72", "score": 9.972399711608887}, {"content": "Title: White House budget: All systems go at NASA Content: The president\u2019s budget keeps NASA on its current trajectory, with an $18.5 billion top-line number and an all-systems-go approach on such key, high-cost initiatives as the Orion crew capsule and the Space Launch System rocket, both of which are still under development, and the James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled for a 2018 launch.

Some pretty smart people are doing the same thing today. And it\u2019s not childlike curiosity that\u2019s motivating them: It\u2019s money. Interest in materials known as rare earth elements surged when China temporarily blocked exports in 2010. Manufacturers started looking everywhere for new supplies of gadolinium and terbium and other elements used in televisions, hybrid car batteries and many other products. The search took them to such places as California, the Pacific ocean floor and the moon. The moon\u2019s stock is up even among politicians, as Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney recently sparred over whether it makes sense to invest in lunar mining. Rare earth elements aren\u2019t the only potentially valuable resources on the moon. Helium-3, an isotope that in the future may support cold fusion when earthlings finally figure out how to make it happen, is another potential treasure. Helium-3 is a component of the solar wind, which is constantly blowing outward from the sun. Our atmosphere blocks helium-3 from reaching Earth\u2019s surface. The moon doesn\u2019t have much atmosphere, so scientists speculate that there may be more than a million tons of the isotope up there. Ready to grab your moon pick, pull on your moon boots and heigh-ho your way into a moon mine? Not so fast. There\u2019s a vast amount of research that needs to be done first. For starters, scientists say, we need to figure out where the moon came from and what it\u2019s made of. \u201cAlthough we broadly know the composition of the moon, it\u2019s slightly embarrassing to admit that the exact origin and evolution is not totally tied down,\u201d says John Zarnecki, a professor and space researcher at Britain\u2019s Open University. The dominant theory is that a Mars-size object struck Earth 4.5 billion years ago, breaking off a bunch of material that melded together to form the moon. If this theory is correct, we can expect that the moon is made of roughly the same chemical building blocks as Earth. The 1,500 or so pounds of material that U.S. and Soviet explorers brought back from the moon during the 1960s and 1970s provided some support for the theory. NASA sent up an imaging spectrometer called the Moon Mineralogy Mapper on an Indian rocket in 2008. A mechanical failure cut the mission short, but it did provide evidence that there is water on the moon. It also suggested that the moon was once molten. That\u2019s an incredibly important finding because it\u2019s not enough that the moon contain valuable resources; any hope of mining them requires that they be concentrated so that they can be extracted from a small number of locations. While the moon doesn\u2019t have as broad a range of geologic processes as Earth \u2014 there is no indication of plate tectonics, for example \u2014 the cooling-down of a molten rock would help to sort the minerals. Different materials would settle and solidify at different layers. That\u2019s just a start, though. It will take much more research to find the most concentrated deposits of whatever resources exist. Once the scientists get all of this sorted out, it\u2019s time for lunar mining to begin. China, India and Japan have all indicated an interest in setting up moon mining operations. Google and NASA have each offered a $30 million prize to the first private company to put robots on the moon. Naveen Jain is co-founder and chairman of Moon Express, one of the companies vying for the prize. A former executive at Microsoft, Jain is so enthusiastic and confident about moon mining that talking to him makes you wonder why we haven\u2019t been doing it for years. \u201cWe already have much of the technology. We know how to get into Earth orbit, how to land on the moon, and how to return to Earth. There are only a few key problems to solve,\u201d he says. According to Jain, NASA is collaborating with Moon Express on a lunar lander that is being tested at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in California. The lander is intended to hop and hover, which Jain says is the best way to move long distances around the lunar surface. (To understand why, consider NASA\u2019s rover Spirit, whose wheels got stuck in the Martian soil in 2009 and never got out.) Jain is hoping to send the vehicle to the moon on a rocket built by SpaceX, another private foray into the space business, in late 2013 or early 2014. Moon Express or any other group faces several challenges if it\u2019s to establish a long-term robotic mining operation on the moon. (Few in the industry are talking about founding a human colony anytime soon, Gingrich\u2019s ideas notwithstanding.) First, there has to be a way to power the operation. That\u2019s where the water comes in. Lunar water could be split into hydrogen and oxygen for fuel cells, similar to the hydrogen fuel cells that car manufacturers are trying to develop. \u201cThe moon could represent a gas station in the sky,\u201d Zarnecki says. That gas could fuel other space missions in addition to lunar mining. Another major problem is economics. Jain thinks he can land his hovering rover on the moon for less than $100 million. Part of that is coming from private investors and part from a contract with NASA. But he also has some ideas about how to earn some money before the mining operation is up and running. \u201cOnce you\u2019re on the moon, all sorts of opportunities arise,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat if you could pay $30 or $40 to drive a remote-controlled lunar rover around for a few minutes using a Web-based platform? What if I could write messages \u2014 like a wedding proposal \u2014 onto the lunar surface and send you a digital picture for $50? These things add up quickly. Mining isn\u2019t the only potential revenue source on the moon.\u201d Another challenge is the legality. No country, corporation or individual owns the moon. That hasn\u2019t been an issue, because only a minimal amount of material has ever been removed from it. But that\u2019s going to change when the mining starts. Jain draws an analogy to the sea. \u201cNo one owns international waters, but those who invest their money and effort to find fish are entitled to profit,\u201d he says. It\u2019s an intriguing analogy but untested in any court. The lawyers better start working on their arguments: Jain says he plans to start mining in earnest by 2016, although that timelime is incredibly ambitious, to say the least. And China has announced plans to bring back small amounts of lunar rock by 2020 in advance of a manned mission and lunar mining several years later.", "qid": 871, "docid": "c14d537c-4b57-11e1-8269-c719533b4b13", "score": 9.867199897766113}, {"content": "Title: India is going to Mars! But don\u2019t call it a space race. Content: Next week, India is set to launch a probe bound for Mars. It's a big moment for a country that has spent the last 50 years quietly tinkering away on space research while NASA and the European Space Agency have gotten all the glory. And it's a thumb in the eye of China, whose own Mars ambitions came apart in 2011 when technical issues forced Beijing to abandon its launch. But even though India might benefit from beating China to the red planet, experts who appeared at a recent event by the Atlantic Council say gaining an edge back on Earth is the last thing scientists at ISRO, India's space agency, have on their minds. Unlike the space race of the Cold War, where getting to the moon first held important geopolitical ramifications, India's interest in space \u2014 much like China's \u2014 is very closely tied to its economic goals. \"To think that India's going to the moon and Mars because of some cynical ploy to engage in one-upsmanship with the Chinese is wrong,\" says John Sheldon, a national security analyst and founder of The Torridon Group, a strategy firm. India's space program might be obscure to most, but millions of Indians are beneficiaries of it. Not in the American sense that it's produced fun inventions like Tang and Velcro, says Dean Cheng, a scholar at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the country realized early on that satellites would enable health officials to practice medicine remotely, reaching inaccessible parts of the country. The same was true for remote education. ISRO's major focus, in other words, has been to use space research as a way to overcome the country's (still) steep economic obstacles. \"For every rupee invested,\" Sheldon adds, \"there is a return for regular Indian people in terms of what that program provides.\" Space exploration is a little bit different; it doesn't provide same direct economic benefits as building new imaging technologies or figuring out how to put something into geosynchronous orbit over Earth. Still, the tie-in to development is plainly clear: Countries that venture into outer space become part of an exclusive scientific club. Membership means being taken seriously in international circles. And that might be just as important for India's future as figuring out how to feed, shelter and clothe the next few hundred million people who'll be born there by 2050. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Even though politics might influence budgetary decisions about space policy, says Cheng, competition isn't a driving factor. \"When we look at top-tier Asian space powers,\" he says, \"Japan, India, China \u2014 all of these countries went into space for their own reasons. They did not go into space because somebody else went into space. ... Space is the dreadnought of the 21st century, or the automobile.

The chief executive of the Italian defense and aerospace company Finmeccanica, Giuseppe Orsi, was arrested in Milan this week on charges of bribing Indian officials to secure a $750 million deal in 2010 to sell the AW-101 medium-lift helicopters. In response, India ordered a federal probe into the charges and put payments on hold. The Defense Ministry also deferred discussions this week on another contract to buy 197 light utility helicopters, fueling fears that the controversy may paralyze the government\u2019s already painfully slow decision-making process. Defense Minister A.K. Antony told reporters Wednesday that if the probe reveals proof of graft, the Italian company and its Britain-based subsidiary \u201care liable for criminal actions; they are liable to be prosecuted; the company is liable to be blacklisted.\u201d \u201cWe are not bothered about who the companies are, how strong they are, how influential they are,\u201d Antony said. \u201cNobody will be spared.\u201d In a statement Friday, the Defense Ministry said it has notified the Finmeccanica subsidiary, AgustaWestland, that it is seeking to cancel the contract. The company was asked to reply to the notice in seven days. Defense analysts said the dramatic revelations of bribery that are being splashed across Indian newspapers every day \u2014 and the probe they have prompted \u2014 may cast a shadow over India\u2019s ambitious plans to replace its aging military arsenal. Those plans made the country the world\u2019s largest arms importer last year. The bribes were allegedly offered to officials as high as the former air force chief. The case has reminded many Indians of another defense corruption scandal in the 1980s, which helped bring down a government and pushed back many key defense purchase decisions. A similar delay, they now warn, may threaten India\u2019s security at a time when its lumbering military needs to urgently transform itself into a leaner and more lethal force to face potential threats from neighbors such as China and Pakistan. \u201cThe unfortunate fallout of the current helicopter controversy is that decisions will get stalled, people will play safe and not take any decisions at all, and that will affect our defense modernization and preparedness adversely,\u201d said Mrinal Suman, a retired army major general who instructs foreign defense manufacturers on Indian weapons procurement policies. \u201cThe modernization of our armed forces is already lagging behind by 15 years. About half of the weapons and equipment in India\u2019s armed forces are obsolete.\u201d In 2011, V.K. Singh, then chief of the Indian army, said the army\u2019s major combat weapons were in an \u201calarming\u201d state, making India unfit for war. India in recent years has embarked on plans to upgrade its Soviet-era arsenal with new fighter aircraft, antitank missiles, maritime patrol aircraft, infantry combat vehicles, helicopters, assault rifles and submarines \u2014 a shopping list worth about $100 billion over more than a decade. U.S. companies hope to corner a predominant share of this market in the coming years. Defense trade between the United States and India has generated nearly $8 billion since 2005, coinciding with a new era of closer ties between the two nations. But each defense purchase takes an average of eight to 10 years, frustrating many foreign vendors. \u201cOvercautious officers delay the process by looping in and marking defense acquisition files to every senior [official], just to avoid taking individual responsibility for their decisions,\u201d said an industry observer familiar with the process. The reason for such nervousness, analysts said, is the bruising aftermath of a defense corruption scandal in 1989, in which Indian officials were accused of receiving bribes from the Swedish company Bofors in return for a contract to buy howitzers. The scandal cost the then-ruling Congress party dearly in elections that year. \u201cIt took at least 15 years for the government to recover from the shock of the Bofors scandal and pick up the courage to take decisions on buying weapons again,\u201d said Suman. An editorial Thursday in the Indian Express newspaper warned against \u201cthe system\u2019s tendency to lapse into inertia and indecision when faced with demands for greater accountability.\u201d As in the aftermath of the Bofors scandal, \u201cprocurement may again be slowed, suspended or banned, apprehending scandal,\u201d the editorial said. \u201cAsked to prove its innocence, the system could again choose to retreat to the comforts of inaction and prevarication.\u201d", "qid": 871, "docid": "05e70f76-775a-11e2-b102-948929030e64", "score": 9.848199844360352}, {"content": "Title: Why it matters that Japan is going to the moon Content: Only three nations have ever soft-landed on the moon \u2013 the United States, the Soviet Union and China \u2014 and now Japan wants to be the fourth.

While there\u2019s the obvious prestige factor for Japan of getting to the moon, the move has another important implication \u2014 it could lead to the more rapid exploration of the moon\u2019s commercial potential. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico There are enormous innovation benefits from having as many players as possible competing to get back to the moon. More competition means more innovation, especially when you take into account Japan\u2019s rich history as a space-faring nation. If you add Japan\u2019s moon bid to the number of international teams that are competing in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, you suddenly have a much richer competitive landscape than if only NASA were trying to get back to the moon. And that could lead to some truly out-of-the-box ideas that go well beyond the space tourism idea mentioned by JAXA last week. While the chance to view the Northern Lights or a \u201cfull Earth-rise\u201d from outer space is a \u201cnice to have,\u201d there are a whole host of other ways that Japan\u2019s innovators could take advantage of the wealth of knowledge gained from Japan\u2019s earlier lunar orbital missions in order to create and build out exciting new commercial concepts. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For example, one moon exploration concept that Japan has floated is a plan to ring the moon with solar panels as a way to power the Earth. The concept \u2014 known as LUNA RING \u2014 was thought up by Japan\u2019s Shimizu Corporation as a unique way to power the planet with clean energy by the year 2035. A small army of robotic workers would construct a massive ring of solar panels along the 11,000-kilometer lunar equator. These solar panels would capture solar radiation from the sun, transform it into energy, and then beam it back to receiving stations on Earth in the form of microwaves or laser light. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Where would Japan get that lunar robot army? Glad you asked. Earlier, the Japanese came up with a $2 billion plan to construct a lunar base for hulking, 660-pound robots on the moon\u2019s surface. Originally announced in 2010, this lunar robot idea was projected for the year 2020. Obviously, that\u2019s not going to happen, but the idea of Japanese lunar bots eventually swarming across the moon\u2019s surface in the future is, at the very least, thought- provoking, especially given Japan\u2019s competitive advantage in robotics. At some point, that robot colony would give way to a manned colony (that is, if the robots let us). *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And once there\u2019s a permanent manned lunar colony on the moon, that opens up other commercial space exploration opportunities \u2014 including a possible trip to Mars or nearby asteroids. For now, the asteroid missions probably are more feasible. JAXA has already taken a ride on an interstellar asteroid and returned the orbital craft safely back to earth. NASA described the legendary Hayabusa mission \u2013 in which just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong \u2013 as \u201cwell beyond remarkable.\u201d And now Japan has a follow-up asteroid explorer mission, known as Hayabusa2. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Even if Japan\u2019s lunar exploration ideas are technologically feasible \u2013 and that\u2019s certainly open to debate (hard landings on the moon are much easier than soft landings) \u2013 there\u2019s still the pesky matter of cost. A lunar mission could cost $80 million or it could cost $8 billion. Nobody really knows. The Japanese space agency confirmed that a cost target of $126 million was one possibility, but has also confirmed that the price tag could balloon as high as $12 billion. That lunar robot base idea was projected to burn through $2 billion in R&D; funding alone, and the development cost of a manned Japanese program could be north of $1 billion. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico To make these astronomical costs pay off, Japanese innovators are going to need a truly breakthrough commercial opportunity. This means not just a \u201cone- and-done\u201d mission to the moon, but a series of repetitive missions that can be performed over and over again. Maybe it\u2019s a big idea \u2014 a new mineral resources or a new clean energy system \u2013 or maybe it\u2019s a smaller idea that can be executed over and over again. That\u2019s why, in many ways, space tourism makes so much sense as an initial first step \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t pay to see a \u201cfull Earth- rise\u201d from lunar orbit? *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico And there could be a twist on that space tourism concept that involves people back on Earth. The sole Japanese entry in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition \u2014 Team HAKUTO \u2014 is building a series of lunar rovers for traversing the moon\u2019s surface in coordination with fellow XPRIZE competitor Astrobotic, which suggested a \u201cNASCAR on the Moon\u201d scenario as one way to build excitement about getting back to the moon. Imagine unleashing a whole host of these lunar rovers on the surface of the moon, and enabling a live video stream where fans from different nations could cheer on their favorite bots as they hop, crawl or race over the surface of the moon towards a finish line. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico A lot has changed in the 40-plus years since the United States last landed a man on the moon.

The demise of the monitoring effort would also increase pressure on the United States, Russia and other key powers to forge a new diplomatic strategy to contain a crisis that threatens to engulf the region. \u201cI have no doubt that we\u2019re going to face a long and bloody summer,\u201d said Salman Shaikh, a former U.N. official who serves as the director of the Brookings Doha Center. \u201cBy pulling these guys out, the international community will face a difficult choice: Is it going to get behind a much more coercive approach or is it going to allow the regime to kill hundreds if not thousands of civilians over the next few months?\u201d On Friday, Mood hinted that a suspension was possible when he warned reporters at a news conference in Damascus that it was becoming increasingly difficult for the 300-strong, unarmed observer mission to carry out its responsibilities. \u201cViolence, over the past 10 days, has been intensifying . . . willingly by the both parties, with losses on both sides and significant risks to our observers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe escalating violence is now limiting our ability to observe, verify, report as well as assist in local dialogue and stability projects.\u201d In response to the heightened risks, Mood had already ordered the mission to scale back its patrols and other activities in Syria, according to two U.N. officials briefed on the decision. Mood\u2019s steps come as representatives of the more than 60 governments providing monitors to the U.N. mission have warned that the dangers faced by U.N. blue helmets might have grown too serious to justify their presence in Syria, particularly when the peace process is stalled. On Wednesday, Brazil, India, Ireland and other countries with observers on the ground voiced anxiety about the security of their personnel. There is a \u201cconcern among the member states providing observers that the risk level is approaching the level where they are not willing to accept it any more,\u201d Mood said. Mood did not indicate at his news conference Friday whether he advocated beefing up the force or abolishing it altogether. But U.N. officials made it clear that they oppose expanding or reinforcing the U.N. mission, saying it would increase their exposure to attacks. For the time being, no one has officially proposed pulling the observers out of Syria. But some Security Council diplomats have privately acknowledged that such a move would be likely in the event of a major attack that resulted in the death of significant numbers of U.N. personnel. The U.N. monitoring mission is central to the implementation of a U.N.-mandated peace plan \u2014 known as Kofi Annan\u2019s six-point plan \u2014 that has failed to halt the violence. An April 12 cease-fire brought only a brief respite, and many in the international community are warning that Syria\u2019s 15-month-old uprising against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad is at risk of becoming an all-out civil war. The observers\u2019 role is to \u201cmonitor a cessation, not to stop, armed violence,\u201d Mood said. But he said it is now clear that the plan is not being implemented either by the rebels or the government. \u201cThere appears to be a lack of willingness to seek a peaceful transition,\u201d the general said. \u201cInstead, there is a push towards advancing military positions.\u201d The monitors have provided a steady diet of raw information, however incomplete, linking the Syrian government and pro-government militias to some of the worst atrocities, including the massacre of 108 civilians in Houla, where the monitors said they found fresh tank tracks and evidence of government shelling. The findings have largely undercut claims by Syria\u2019s chief defenders, China and Russia, that Syrian government forces have played no role in mass killings, and secured their support for a Security Council statement condemning Syria for its role in the Houla massacre. The monitors have also documented multiple abuses by armed opposition groups and flagged concerns about the emergence of violent extremists groups in Syria. \u201cI think the mission has probably outperformed expectations,\u201d said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations at New York University\u2019s Center for International Cooperation. \u201cIts reporting has put the focus on the government in a way that even independent media and Syrian [nongovernmental organizations] could not, and made it harder for the Russians and Chinese to ignore the realities on the ground.\u201d But Gowan added that any hope that evidence of Syrian atrocities \u201cwould sway Russian opinion turns out to be a fallacy.\u201d Mood is scheduled to travel to New York to brief the Security Council on Monday. His dire assessment is likely to accelerate discussions underway in New York on the future of the U.N. mission in Syria. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had already instructed his peacekeeping department to prepare a set of possible options for reconfiguring the peacekeeping mission when its 90-day mandate expires on July 20. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has proposed adopting a legally binding Security Council resolution that would compel Syria to implement Annan\u2019s peace plan or face the \u201cpain of very heavy sanctions.\u201d But Russia and China would almost certainly block such a measure. Susan E. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, meanwhile, has questioned the viability of the U.N. monitors. In a closed-door meeting this week, she likened them to \u201c300 sitting ducks in a shooting gallery, one IED away from a disaster,\u201d according to a diplomat who was present. **More world news coverage:** \\- U.S. outsources bulk of Africa spy work \\- Egypt\u2019s generals shutter parliament \\- China\u2019s corruption on trial in Bo Xilai case \\- Read more headlines from around the world", "qid": 871, "docid": "4ba6dd70-b702-11e1-92df-14cd260b161d", "score": 9.794400215148926}, {"content": "Title: As Obama prepares for U.N. speech, experts say his stance toward group fits U.S. pattern Content: UNITED NATIONS \u2014 As President Obama weighed his options last month in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria, he made clear that he was prepared to bypass the United Nations on the way to war. He will return to the United Nations this week to deliver his fifth annual speech to the General Assembly, having clinched a deal that places the world\u2019s leading diplomatic organization squarely at the center of efforts to secure President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s chemical arsenal. Obama, who will arrive in New York on Monday and address the General Assembly on Tuesday, is expected to argue that Syria has only a limited opportunity to abide by its agreement to turn over its chemical weapons. The U.N. Security Council is key to that process, and U.S. officials hope that it will quickly pass a resolution to legally bind Syria to its commitments. Critics have described Obama\u2019s diplomatic efforts on Syria as topsy-turvy. The president\u2019s address, they note, will come just a couple of weeks after his administration brushed aside international calls for American officials to wait for the results of a U.N. investigation of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. But experts say Obama\u2019s approach has been consistent with that of his predecessors, many of whom extolled the United Nations in theory while treating it with ambivalence in practice. \u201cPresident Obama is acting in a way that is typical of U.S. presidents,\u201d said Edward Luck, the dean of the School of Peace Studies at the University of San Diego. \u201cI think it has been the norm for the United States to look for other options, and if other options don\u2019t work, then they go back to the United Nations.\u201d In the case of Syria, Obama faced the strong possibility that Congress would reject his appeal for military action, as a broad swath of Democrats and Republicans expressed concerns about the plan. Instead, an agreement reached by U.S. and Russian officials meeting in Geneva just over a week ago has provided the administration with a diplomatic escape hatch. The plan has also offered Obama an opportunity to achieve a goal that U.S. airstrikes could not: the destruction of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal. The deal has been criticized as an act of betrayal by many in the Syrian opposition and some of their foreign backers. But it has been received with relief by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and foreign leaders who feared the consequences of military action without U.N. authorization. At the same time, the agreement has set the stage for months, if not years, of potentially contentious squabbling between the United States and Russia over ensuring that Syria complies and gives up its weapons. Under the pact, Syria must turn over its chemical weapons by the middle of 2014. But nonproliferation experts say that schedule is unlikely to be met without the threat of force compelling Assad\u2019s government to cooperate. \u201cThe threat of military action to enforce compliance is critical,\u201d said Amy E. Smithson, an expert on biological and chemical weapons at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. \u201cOtherwise, Assad will continue to play right out of Saddam Hussein\u2019s playbook of hindering the inspectors to try to hide weapons and resources to resurrect his program.\u201d The United States and Russia remain locked in negotiations over a U.N. Security Council resolution on the plan for Syria\u2019s disarmament. Russia has made clear that it would not support a resolution that threatened Syria with military force if it did not meet its commitment. Russia\u2019s foreign minister on Sunday accused the United States of threatening to ditch the talks if Moscow doesn\u2019t go along. \u201cOur American partners are starting to blackmail us,\u201d Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with Russia\u2019s Channel One. He said Russia would be prepared to send military observers to Damascus in support of U.N. efforts to disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal. The United States has largely conceded that a U.N.-backed threat of force is unachievable, but top American officials insist that Obama reserves the right to use force. In a briefing to preview Obama\u2019s trip to the United Nations, deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday that \u201cour belief is that there should be a U.N. Security Council resolution, and that that is necessary to ensure that there\u2019s a verifiable process and that there are consequences that are enforced upon the Assad regime should they fail to comply.\u201d Both Democratic and Republican presidents have long bridled at the constraints imposed by the U.N. Charter, which allows the use of force only in self-defense or with the approval of the Security Council. President Bill Clinton bypassed the Security Council in leading a NATO air war against Serbia over Kosovo. President George W. Bush dismissed the council as irrelevant when he authorized an invasion of Iraq in March 2003. In his first address to the General Assembly, Obama sought to mark a departure from his predecessor, saying that he wanted to pursue \u201ca new era of engagement with the world.\u201d But he held few illusions about the organization\u2019s ability to solve the world\u2019s most intractable problems, saying the United Nations too often serves as \u201ca forum for sowing discord\u201d and \u201ca venue for playing politics and exploiting grievances rather than solving problems.\u201d In his first term, Obama turned to the United Nations to strengthen sanctions on Iran and North Korea, and to authorize a NATO-led military operation in Libya. But the president has also shown himself to be every bit as frustrated by the organization\u2019s cumbersome procedures, and its nagging demand for consensus, as his predecessors. After Russia and China blocked several attempts to pass a resolution on Syria, U.S. officials denounced the Security Council as an impediment to action and deemed the efforts of U.N. chemical weapons inspectors largely irrelevant. \u201cThe Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have,\u201d Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said this month. But like his predecessors, Obama now finds himself returning to the United Nations to argue before a community of nations. \u201cIt\u2019s the big kid syndrome; you don\u2019t want to be tied down,\u201d said Michael Doyle, a former U.N. official and a Columbia University professor of international affairs, law and political science. \u201cWe still operate on the view that Washington is the world\u2019s capital. So when do we go to the U.N.?

On Tuesday afternoon, if all goes as planned, India will launch the spacecraft \u2014 called Mangal\u00adyaan, or the Mars Orbiter Mission probe \u2014 from a small island near Chennai on the country\u2019s southern coast. The craft will take 11 months to reach the atmosphere of the cold, forbidding planet, traveling 140 million miles from Earth. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced plans for the mission during a major address in August 2012, a few months after rival China\u2019s attempt to send an orbiter on a Russian mission failed. The plans raised talk of a new space race in Asia. But Deviprasad Karnik, a spokesman for India\u2019s space agency, said the primary objective of the trip is to \u201cshowcase technological capability to reach Mars\u201d and collect data for future space missions. India\u2019s space program, which is a half-century old, has long been a source of national pride, especially in recent years as the rapidly modernizing country raised its ambitions beyond satellite technology to lunar and planetary travel. An unmanned probe that India sent to the moon in 2008 contained an instrument \u2014 financed by the United States \u2014 that detected water trapped in lunar rocks. But the space program has not been without its critics, who wonder why the country is spending $74 million on interplanetary travel while millions of its people remain poor and malnourished. \u201cIt\u2019s a national milestone for the country to conquer territories beyond planet Earth,\u201d said Bharath Gopalaswamy, a Chennai native who is the deputy director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council. \u201cIndia has its own ambitions. Just because we\u2019re poor doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t have any ambitions. That\u2019s not the way we think about ourselves, right?\u201d The program\u2019s defenders have said that it helped develop satellite technology for India that was used for the benefit of the underserved, bringing classrooms and health care to remote areas and mapping water resources for wells. India is entering the Mars arena as the international space race has grown far more competitive and globalized. A growing number of countries and commercial entities have set their sights on sending a manned mission to Mars sometime in the next two decades. NASA head Charles Bolden has said that a human mission to Mars, which the U.S. space agency hopes to launch by 2030, is a priority for the agency and that the \u201centire exploration program is aligned to support this goal.\u201d Close on the heels of the India launch, NASA will launch its newest Mars probe, called Maven, from Cape Canaveral on Nov. 18. Scientists hope it will lend insights into climate changes that can help them understand climate shifts on Earth. Meanwhile, the United States has been losing its historical dominance in the arena as funding has slumped and other nations have jumped into the fray. Scientists say the India mission will help continue to map the surface of Mars, which in many ways remains a mystery. \u201cDespite the existing data, we really do not understand the planet\u2019s history and its potential for life,\u201d Jeff Plescia, a scientist with the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an e-mail. Plescia said previous spacecraft have seen small channels forming, dusty material moving around the planet\u2019s surface, craters from asteroids forming, and ice being exposed and evaporating. \u201cHaving more sensors in orbit provides a better understanding of those events and how they occur,\u201d he said. If all goes as scheduled, the Mangalyaan spacecraft is expected to reach Mars\u2019s orbit in September, making India the fourth nation or group to reach Mars, after the United States, Russia (and the former Soviet Union) and the European Space Agency. But NASA\u2019s director of planetary science, Jim Green, said the Indian mission faces long odds. Of 40 missions to Mars by various countries, he said, only 16 have been successful. \u201cThe track record tells us Mars is very, very hard,\u201d Green said. He noted that some missions have missed the planet entirely and that some have crashed into it. India\u2019s orbiter \u2014 should it make it all the way to Mars \u2014 will carry a sensor that could help detect the presence of methane, a gas produced by living microbes. If found, the presence of methane could answer the question that has dogged scientists for years: Is there life on Mars? Although NASA scientists think that they found methane in earlier experiments, the Mars rover Curiosity, which landed on the cratered surface last year, has not found any. But the scientists have not given up hope. \u201cWe are seeking signs of life, and methane can be one of those signatures,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know if Mars is currently harboring life that\u2019s generating methane now, so the India mission is a great step.\u201d Suhasini Raj contributed to this report.", "qid": 871, "docid": "34f4b796-44b9-11e3-95a9-3f15b5618ba8", "score": 9.752099990844727}, {"content": "Title: What South Korea\u2019s election means for the U.S. Content: MOON JAE-IN, who easily won South Korea\u2019s presidential election Tuesday, was the beneficiary of another popular backlash against a ruling establishment perceived as corrupt and out of touch. Already unhappy with a slowing economy and shrinking opportunities for the young, South Koreans took to the streets by the hundreds of thousands last year when President Park Geun-hye was accused of conspiring with a friend to extort bribes from the country\u2019s big conglomerates. After Ms. Park was impeached and jailed, Mr. Moon, a leftist former human rights lawyer who lost to her in the last presidential election, was the obvious alternative. His promises to boost government hiring, tighten regulation of the big companies and conduct a more modest and open presidency are a natural response to the mood of dissatisfaction. Yet if Mr. Moon\u2019s ascent can be described as a triumph for South Korea\u2019s young democracy, it may pose a challenge to an already wobbly U.S. position in Asia. President Trump has made the denuclearization of North Korea a top priority of his new administration, pursuing \u2014 sometimes erratically \u2014 a strategy of sharply raising the pressure on the regime of Kim Jong Un while holding out the prospect of negotiations. Mr. Moon has advocated a more dovish approach \u2014 and he has expressed unhappiness with what looked like a U.S. race to put a new missile defense system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), in place before the election took place. The hurried deployment of the THAAD batteries last month, literally in the middle of the night, \u201clacked democratic procedure,\u201d Mr. Moon complained in an interview last week with The Post\u2019s Anna Fifield and Yoonjung Seo. He has a point: Though the system is an important and needed counter to the growing missile threat from Pyongyang, the action looked like an attempt to circumvent Mr. Moon\u2019s expressed reservations by creating a fait accompli. Mr. Moon also sounded unhappy with Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of aggressively pursuing cooperation on North Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying South Korea should \u201ctake the lead on matters in the Korean Peninsula\u201d rather than \u201ctake the back seat and watch discussions between the U.S. and China.\u201d The new president has long been an advocate of rapprochement between the two Koreas and has advocated reopening two joint projects that provided North Korea with valuable streams of hard currency \u2014 a step that would run directly counter to Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of tightening sanctions. It does not help that Mr. Trump recently trashed the \u201chorrible\u201d U.S.-South Korea free-trade agreement and suggested that South Korea should pay $1 billion for THAAD, in contravention of a bilateral agreement. That played into the hands of Mr. Moon, who has written that South Korea should \u201clearn to say no\u201d to Washington. Should Mr. Trump persist in that line, he could quickly sabotage both his North Korea initiative and bilateral relations with a vital American ally. The good news is that Mr. Moon is for now striking a conciliatory note. He told Ms. Fifield that \u201cPresident Trump is more reasonable than he is generally perceived\u201d and that he agrees with the U.S. strategy of \u201capplying sanctions and pressure\u201d to Pyongyang if it leads to negotiations. This is a relationship that can be saved and even strengthened \u2014 if Mr. Trump handles it with care. **Read more on this topic:** John Pomfret: What South Korea\u2019s election means for Asia\u2019s nuclear crisis The Post\u2019s View: South Korea\u2019s democracy does the right thing \u2014 but that won\u2019t solve all its problems Josh Rogin: South Korea\u2019s turmoil could spoil Trump\u2019s North Korea plan The Post\u2019s View: \u2018Strategic patience\u2019 with North Korea is over.

Book your seat now \u2014 though it\u2019s going to set you back $750 million (it\u2019s unclear if that includes baggage fees). Led by heavy-hitter former NASA executives, the Golden Spike Co. would boldly go where humankind went 40 years ago, this time commercially, hawking tickets to foreign governments or space tourists. \u201cTwo seats, 750 each,\u201d former NASA associate administrator Alan Stern said on Thursday, shortly before he appeared at the National Press Club in Washington to announce the formation of the company. \u201cThe trick is 40 years old. We know how to do this.\u201d You won\u2019t have to joystick the lunar lander yourself, so don\u2019t worry about dodging killer craters and boulders on the way down. Everything will be automated and controlled from Earth. It\u2019ll be like taking a train, the company said. \u201cWe realize this is the stuff of science fiction. We intend to make it science fact,\u201d Stern said at the news conference. He added: \u201cWe believe in the price points that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d The company has assembled some credible advisers, with a board chaired by former NASA Johnson Space Center director Gerry Griffin. The business model requires economies of scale \u2014 lots of customers and lots of missions to the moon to offset the very high start-up cost. The company sees 2020 as a plausible date for that initial trip. Golden Spike would need to commission a lunar lander and moonwalking suits, but most of its mission architecture would rely on commercial rockets and capsules already flying or under development. For example, the company could use a rocket and capsule developed by Elon Musk\u2019s commercial start-up SpaceX, which has successfully flown cargo to the international space station under a NASA contract. The primary targets for Golden Spike are foreign countries that want to do lunar science or attain the prestige of putting their own astronauts on the moon. Because of political sensitivities, the company would not sell a moon trip to China, which has been expanding its space program, Stern said. Nor would the company sell rides to any country restricted by law from access to U.S. technology that could be used for military purposes. Stern said the company has no billionaire backers but has had a serious discussion with one potential lunar tourist. He wouldn\u2019t give the name. \u201cIf you come to me and you\u2019re not an unsavory character, we\u2019re going to fly you,\u201d he said before the news conference. \u201cIf NASA wants a ride, we\u2019d be glad to put them on our railroad,\u201dGriffin added. The company\u2019s board of advisers includes former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who during the Republican primaries early this year said that as president he\u2019d establish a permanent moon base by 2021. NASA\u2019s official reaction to Golden Spike: Go for it. \u201cThis type of private sector effort is further evidence of the timeliness and wisdom of the Obama Administration\u2019s overall space policy \u2014 to create an environment where commercial space companies can build upon NASA\u2019s past successes, allowing the agency to focus on the new challenges of sending humans to an asteroid and eventually Mars,\u201d NASA spokesman David Weaver said in a written statement. Twelve human beings have set foot on the moon, the first in 1969, the last in 1972, all of them Apollo astronauts. Thursday\u2019s news conference coincided with the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 17, the final Apollo mission. It also came one day after the release of a scathing review of NASA\u2019s strategy by the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, which was commissioned by NASA on orders from Congress, concluded that the space agency has failed to come up with a robust strategy for human spaceflight. President Obama decided to cancel NASA\u2019s Constellation program, which was initiated during the George W. Bush years as the next step in space exploration after the retirement of the space shuttle. Constellation aimed to put astronauts back on the moon by 2020, but a presidential panel said the program was underfunded and implausible. Now NASA is building a new heavy-lift rocket capable of missions beyond Earth orbit, with the goal of visiting a near-Earth asteroid in the middle of the next decade. Routine access to space is being shifted to companies operating under commercial contracts. And there are a number of ventures aiming at space tourists who would pay to go into low Earth orbit. Golden Spike, whether it turns out to be viable or not, is the latest sign that outer space is increasingly attractive to entrepreneurs. Nancy Conrad, the widow of Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad, and a board member of Golden Spike, said her husband would be thrilled about the company\u2019s plans: \u201cHe\u2019d probably be clicking his heels, because this should open up the frontier for everyone.\u201d Also on hand was Andrew Chaikin, author of multiple books on the space program and another company adviser. \u201cWe are the children of Apollo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take no for an answer.\u201d But no has been the pragmatic answer for a long time. The moon is an airless, waterless, lifeless sphere that makes Antarctica look like South Beach. The distance to the moon isn\u2019t the problem \u2014 it\u2019s just a few days away \u2014 but it\u2019s not easy climbing into its gravity well, landing safely, blasting off again and returning safely to Earth. The Golden Spike mission architecture requires four separate launches and various feats of refueling and docking in space. \u201cI think somebody could make this work if there were enough people trying,\u201d said Howard McCurdy, a professor of public affairs at American University and author of many books on the space program. \u201cThe model that they\u2019re using is an entrepreneurial model that sort of requires a lot of competition.\u201d Challenged by an Associated Press reporter to explain how the company could possibly turn a profit \u2014 especially since the first mission would cost the company at least $7 billion by its own estimate \u2014 Stern said the business plan had been carefully vetted. One should not overlook the \u201cmedia stream,\u201d he said. The missions could be televised, with corporate sponsorship, advertising, naming rights and so on. It could be as big as the Olympics for some countries, Stern said.

Korea\u2019s rocket launch plans intensify concern about long-range missile potential Content: SEOUL \u2014 North Korea said Saturday that it intends to use a three-stage rocket to launch a satellite into orbit later this month, a move that the United States and its allies describe as a de facto long-range missile test that violates Pyongyang\u2019s international commitments. In an announcement carried by its state-run news agency, the North said that the launch would take place between Dec. 10 and Dec. 22, with the rocket traveling south between the Korean Peninsula and China on a \u201csafe flight path.\u201d A South Korean Foreign Ministry statement called the launch a \u201cgrave concern.\u201d The North\u2019s fourth attempt to send a satellite into orbit comes just eight months after a high-profile failure in which the carrier rocket disintegrated some 90 seconds after liftoff. This latest attempt also complicates the Dec. 19 South Korean presidential election, in which both leading candidates have called for rapprochement with the North but said little about how that would work if tensions increase. If North Korea succeeds with its launch, the family-run police state will become a more urgent security concern for President Obama, as well as for the soon-to-be-chosen new leaders in Seoul and Tokyo. Sending a three-stage rocket into orbit would represent the North\u2019s most significant step yet toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, although key hurdles would remain. North Korea\u2019s satellite-carrying rocket depends on technology similar to that used in a long-range missile.

Security Council resolutions, North Korea is prohibited from conducting any test or launch using \u201cballistic missile technology.\u201d The country has also conducted two nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009. \u201cDevoting scarce resources to the development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles will only further isolate and impoverish North Korea,\u201d State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said. Security analysts say the North could be using the launch as a way to firm up support for leader Kim Jong Eun, who is overhauling the country\u2019s massive military with a handpicked lineup of new officers. In power for nearly a year, Kim has done little to break with the policies of his father and grandfather, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, who built a country that sends political dissenters to gulags, wobbles under food shortages, channels money to the military and uses the occasional satellite launch as a way to show off a \u201cthriving nation.\u201d According to North Korea\u2019s state media, two of its satellite launch attempts \u2014 in 1998 and 2009 \u2014 were successful, placing into orbit devices that can forecast weather and transmit revolutionary songs. But international tracking data indicate that both satellites dropped into the sea. The North also conducted a long-range missile test in 2006, which failed about 40 seconds after liftoff and was never described as a satellite launch attempt. The North, in a notable change, admitted its April 2012 failure and said that its scientists would look into the cause. In almost every way, the upcoming launch feels like a reprise: The same launch site, in the country\u2019s northwest, is being used, and the satellite has the same name, Kwangmyongsong-3, as does the rocket, Unha-3. A spokesman for the [North] Korean Committee for Space Technology was quoted in Pyongyang\u2019s state media as saying that the North has analyzed its previous mistakes and improved the \u201creliability and precision of the satellite and carrier rocket.\u201d \u201cThe question is whether they have really gone through the engineering corrections or are they rushing it for political reasons?\u201d said Dan Pinkston, a Seoul-based security expert for the International Crisis Group. \u201cThat\u2019s tough to say.\u201d The Saturday announcement did not come as a total surprise, because recent satellite images had shown a flurry of activity at the launch site, including the arrival, in trailers, of two stages of the rocket. Analysts in Seoul said the North was taking a risk with its launch because the move could anger China, its lone major benefactor, whose Communist Party last month promoted a new circle of leaders . A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, asked Tuesday about a potential launch, said only that \u201cit\u2019s the common responsibility and shared interest of all parties concerned to maintain the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d Experts offered mixed opinions on how, or whether, the North\u2019s planned launch will color the South Korean presidential race, a close contest between ruling conservative party candidate Park Geun-hye and liberal candidate Moon Jae-in. The North has a strong preference for a liberal leader in Seoul, and Moon has called for a resumption of the aid and joint economic projects that were scrapped under current President Lee Myung-bak. South Korean voters, though, are notoriously volatile, and last-minute opinion polls often misread the ultimate election winners. The North\u2019s security threat could drive the appetite for a hard response to Pyongyang. It could just as easily build sentiment for a softer approach in Seoul that eases tensions. A statement from Moon\u2019s Democratic United Party described the North\u2019s planned launch as a \u201clong-range rocket test with a military purpose,\u201d and it cautioned Park\u2019s Saenuri Party from using this \u201coccasion to raise security concerns favoring their election campaign.\u201d The Saenuri Party, in its own statement, called on Pyongyang to abandon its launch plan and accused it of trying to \u201cinfluence the presidential election by creating instability in the Korean Peninsula and . . . [to] induce an election result favoring North Korea.\u201d Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report. SEOUL \u2014 North Korea said Saturday that it intends to use a three-stage rocket to launch a satellite into orbit later this month, a move that Washington and its allies describe as a de facto long-range missile test that violates Pyongyang\u2019s international commitments. In an announcement carried by its state-run news agency, the North said that the launch would take place between Dec. 10 and 22, with the rocket traveling southward between the Korean Peninsula and China. The North\u2019s fourth attempt to send a satellite into orbit comes just eight months after a high-profile failure in which the carrier rocket disintegrated seconds after liftoff. This latest attempt also complicates the Dec. 19 South Korean presidential election, where both leading candidates have called for rapprochement with the North but said little about how that will work as tensions increase. If North Korea succeeds with its launch, the family-run police state will become a more urgent security concern for President Obama, as well as new leaders in Seoul and Tokyo. By sending a three-stage rocket into orbit, the North would take its most significant step yet in developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that can hit the U.S. mainland. Though key hurdles would remain, North Korea\u2019s satellite-carrying rocket depends on similar technology to a long-range missile. ****", "qid": 871, "docid": "510787f8-3b9e-11e2-8a97-363b0f9a0ab3", "score": 9.72130012512207}, {"content": "Title: U.N. condemns North Korean launch after an emergency meeting Content: The United Nations on Sunday condemned North Korea\u2019s satellite launch as a \u201cdangerous and serious\u201d violation of international restrictions, and threatened new sanctions aimed at dissuading the rogue nation from building missiles capable of delivering weapons against distant adversaries, including the United States. The launch followed North Korea\u2019s detonation of a nuclear device last month, putting new pressure on the United States and its threatened ally South Korea to take steps that could include deploying a missile defense capability that is firmly opposed by China. After an emergency meeting at the U.N. headquarters in New York on Sunday, members of the Security Council accused North Korea of defying repeated warnings with an action that constitutes \u201ca clear threat to international peace and security.\u201d \u201cThe members of the Security Council strongly condemn this launch,\u201d the council said in a statement read by Rafael Ram\u00edrez, the Venezuelan ambassador at the United Nations. Dismissing the North\u2019s claim of peaceful intent, he described the satellite launch as a provocative step toward the \u201cdevelopment of nuclear weapons delivery systems.\u201d But the Security Council provided no details on the nature of any new sanctions it may pursue against the country, which has ignored an array of existing punitive measures with a series of long-range rocket launches and nuclear weapons tests in recent years. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the launch was \u201cdeeply deplorable,\u201d carried out \u201cdespite the united plea of the international community against such an act.\u201d The denunciations were accompanied by other signals that the fallout in the region may go beyond diplomatic measures. The United States and South Korea signaled new interest in exploring the installation of a sophisticated U.S. antimissile system \u2014 a step that Seoul previously had resisted under pressure from China. South Korean and U.S. military officials said Sunday that they had agreed to begin negotiations for the \u201cearliest possible\u201d deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that uses ground-based launchers to shoot down missiles. \u201cNorth Korea continues to develop their nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, and it is the responsibility of our alliance to maintain a strong defense against those threats,\u201d Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said in a statement. \u201cTHAAD can add an important capability.\u201d Missile experts said the THAAD system is regarded as an effective defense against short- and medium-range missiles, meaning that it could protect South Korea from attack but would be of little use against long-range strikes, such as a missile aimed at the United States. Saturday\u2019s launch was widely seen as a cover for North Korean efforts to acquire intercontinental capability, although bringing a warhead back down through the atmosphere to hit a distant target is significantly more complex than sending a satellite into space. The renewed discussions of deploying the THAAD system reflect rising anxiety in South Korea, where leaders may be less inclined to comply with warnings from China or trust Beijing\u2019s assertions that it can keep North Korea in check. The anti-missile system has been controversial in South Korea, which has increasingly close economic and diplomatic ties with China. South Korean officials worry that hosting the anti-missile batteries would annoy Beijing. Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap News Agency last month that China hoped that South Korea \u201cwill handle the matter prudently.\u201d Beijing\u2019s position was that all countries should consider the national interests of other nations in taking their own security into account, she said. Russia also opposes the deployment of THAAD in South Korea. \u201cIt would appear that South Korea has had enough,\u201d said Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. South Korea\u2019s reluctance to allow the missile defense system \u201chas everything to do with the politics and pressure that China has been putting on its southern neighbor,\u201d Karako said. But the back-to-back nuclear test and satellite launch by the North is likely \u201cto drive the United States and South Korea much closer together and further mute the effect of Chinese objections.\u201d China does not seem particularly keen to crack down on its neighbor. A commentary run by the state-run Xinhua news agency immediately after the launch said: \u201cAmid criticism and condemnation, what should be borne in mind is that negotiations are the only viable solution to the predicament on the Korean Peninsula, as China has repeatedly pointed out.\u201d North Korea said Saturday that it had fired a Kwangmyongsong-4 (the name translates as \u201clode star\u201d), a newer-model satellite than the one launched three years ago and one that it said was equipped with devices for Earth measurement and communication. The rocket went missing from South Korean military radar in the sea near Jeju Island at 9:36 a.m., defense ministry spokesman Moon Sang-gyun said, but the Japanese government said that the rocket passed over the southern islands of Okinawa at about 9:41 a.m. There were no reports of any debris falling on land. \u201cIt cannot be business as usual,\u201d Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that the Security Council unites. We are hopeful that China, like all council members, will see the grave threat to regional and international peace and security, see the importance of adopting tough, unprecedented measures, breaking new ground here, exceeding the expectations of [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un.\u201d", "qid": 871, "docid": "01a89d9a-cdb4-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad", "score": 9.708900451660156}, {"content": "Title: How property rights in outer space may lead to a scramble to exploit the moon\u2019s resources Content: This week the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation known as the SPACE Act of 2015 (The U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act), which recognizes and promotes the rights of U.S. companies to engage in the exploration and extraction of space resources from asteroids and other celestial bodies. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That\u2019s a huge win for private space exploration companies, especially for companies with upcoming plans to tap into the economic potential of the moon. That\u2019s because the legislation, in its definition of \u201cspace resources,\u201d is sufficiently broad to include resources found on the lunar surface. In short, the moon could now be in play for some of America\u2019s most innovative space exploration companies. One of those companies is Moon Express, a privately funded commercial space company with an audacious plan to mine the surface of the moon. As Bob Richards, co-founder and CEO of Moon Express, told me, minerals and water found on the moon would be technically classified as a \u201cspace resource\u201d according to Title IV of the SPACE Act, which defines \u201cspace resource\u201d simply as \u201can abiotic resource in situ in outer space.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico \u201cThe key to unlocking the economic potential of the moon is the water on the moon,\u201d Richards said. \u201cWater is the \u2018oil of the solar system,\u2019 and can be used to create rocket fuel that changes the economics of space resources, not just on the moon, but throughout the solar system. So our initial goal is to locate and learn how to mine and stockpile the water on the moon. We\u2019re effectively after our first gusher.\u201d And it\u2019s not just Moon Express interested in finding water on the moon. Mining the moon for water has attracted the attention of Shackleton Energy Resources, which suggests that there are billions of tons of water ice on the poles of the moon that might be converted into rocket fuel. Moreover, NASA has two different mission concepts for extracting water from the lunar surface. If there\u2019s ever going to be human lunar colony, then finding water on the moon is going to be a priority. It\u2019s just cheaper and easier to have a source of water on the moon than it is to bring water to the moon. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In introducing the SPACE Act legislation for a vote Monday night, House Majority Leader (R-Calif.) Kevin McCarthy invoked the inspiring examples of both Kitty Hawk and Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier and cited the extraordinary innovation already happening around commercial space exploration: *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico When it comes to outer space, however, there\u2019s the matter of a pesky little document known as the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, to which the United States is a signatory. The Outer Space Treaty indirectly suggests that commercial space companies don\u2019t own the rights to any resources they find in outer space. The treaty states that no \u201ccelestial body\u201d is subject to \u201cnational appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The SPACE Act of 2015 carefully skirts this issue by specifically making a disclaimer that the United States \u201cdoes not thereby assert sovereignty or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body.\u201d Clever, right? If there\u2019s no U.S. sovereign claim, then the Outer Space Treaty can\u2019t be applicable to private U.S. companies that assert a similar type of claim. When asked about a hypothetical example in which a Chinese company or even the Chinese government might contest the rights of a U.S. company to space resources, Richards suggests that the SPACE Act would provide a sufficient legal basis. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what challenge China or any other country could mount against this U.S. legislation, which is about rights to materials obtained, not territory, and is really just codifying principles and rights already in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that have been demonstrated by multinational activities on the moon as applicable to the private sector.\u201d Nearly 50 years ago, of course, we didn\u2019t know anything about the economic potential of space and nobody was seriously talking about humans as an interplanetary species. Certainly, there were not any private companies angling for a piece of the action. Space exploration was solely the preserve of sovereign governments and we referred to astronauts as the \u201cenvoys of mankind.\u201d The prevailing sentiment, as expressed in the Outer Space Treaty, was that outer space should belong to all of humanity, not just the first nation to venture into space and plant a flag on the surface of a celestial body. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico What\u2019s happening now, in essence, is a sea change in how we think about outer space. To convince private commercial space exploration companies to invest millions of dollars, there have to be economic incentives involved. In short, financial backers of these companies have to be able to realize a profit from their investments if innovation is going to happen. That\u2019s the reality. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Richards cites the rights of fishing boats in international waters as an economic template for the SPACE Act, \u201cThe ships are owned by companies flying flags of nations under which laws they are bound: they have a right to peacefully fish in international waters that they don\u2019t own; but they have a right of ownership of the fish once obtained.\u201d The fishing analogy is a useful one. It suggests that we\u2019re simply extending the same economic principles used on Earth to the moon and beyond, not creating new principles. Seafaring nations are now spacefaring nations. Moon Express even refers to the moon as \u201cthe eighth continent,\u201d suggesting that people should think about the moon the same way they think about the other seven continents on the planet. And Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company, refers to the \u201coff-planet economy.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Throughout the annals of exploration, there have always been commercial incentives. Would the untapped economic potential of America have been possible without similar types of incentives? One example cited by backers of the SPACE Act is the Homestead Act of 1862, which paved the way for Americans to search for gold and timber. Governments they say, have an important role to play here by passing legislation that catalyzes, rather than stifles, growth and innovation. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico For supporters of the SPACE Act, the year 2017 looms large. That\u2019s exactly 50 years since the passage of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. And it\u2019s also the deadline for winning the $30 million Google Lunar X-PRIZE. If privately owned companies are going to be landing on the surface of the moon within the next 24 months, they are going to want assurances that their innovative efforts now are going to have an economic payoff later. *[WSU]: Wayne State University *[Tue]: Tuesday *[Wed]: Wednesday *[UNM]: University of New Mexico", "qid": 871, "docid": "2c54e402cbb882dedb5e97aa34241c86", "score": 9.634699821472168}, {"content": "Title: We participated in talks with North Korean representatives. This is what we learned. Content: _Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, previously served as the CIA\u2019s deputy division chief for Korea. Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst and director for Korea, Japan and oceanic affairs at the U.S. National Security Council, is managing director for Korea at the Bower Group Asia consultancy._ Not even the fate of American student Otto Warmbier, who died this week after returning to the United States following his detainment in North Korea, will dissuade advocates of \u201cengagement\u201d with Pyongyang. They argue that, however repugnant the regime, diplomacy is the only way to stop North Korea\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear and missile programs. But our recent experience suggests that trying to talk to supreme leader Kim Jong Un is a waste of time. This month, we were part of a group of delegates from the United States, Japan, China and South Korea who met in Sweden with representatives of North Korea to explore possible grounds for resuming the six-party talks that collapsed in 2009. After many hours with the North Korean delegation at these \u201c1.5 track\u201d talks, we left more pessimistic than when we arrived. North Korean officials made unambiguously clear that Pyongyang will not be deterred from augmenting its nuclear arsenal or test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile that could eventually threaten the U.S. homeland. There were no signals of flexibility or willingness to negotiate on these programs. Throughout, the North Korean message was that denuclearization is off the table. Pyongyang\u2019s representatives declared: \u201cThe most perfect weapons system will never become the exclusive property of the United States.\u201d We tried repeatedly to ascertain whether any combination of economic and diplomatic benefits or security reassurances could induce Pyongyang to comply with its previously negotiated commitments and with U.N. resolutions. The answer was an emphatic, unwavering no. Citing the fates of Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein and Libya\u2019s Moammar Gaddafi, the North Koreans repeatedly said that their nuclear program is the ultimate life preserver for the regime. Our North Korean interlocutors presented a stark choice: \u201cFirst accept us as a nuclear state, then we are prepared to talk about a peace treaty or fight. We are ready for either.\u201d The North Koreans weren\u2019t saying that they would initiate hostilities but that they would fight if provoked. A peace treaty ending the Korean War and legitimizing the North Korean state is a long- standing goal for Pyongyang, which sees it as a catalyst for the removal of all U.S. forces from the peninsula. Strikingly different from similar meetings in the past was the self- confidence, even cockiness, of the North Koreans, clearly a result of the recent successes of their nuclear and missile programs. The North Koreans also made clear that their nuclear program is a response to the general \u201cU.S. hostile policy.\u201d As such, nothing Seoul could offer would alter Pyongyang\u2019s commitment to its nuclear arsenal. The North Koreans won\u2019t even deign to negotiate with the South Koreans, whom they described repeatedly as \u201cpuppets\u201d of the United States. Thus, the new South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, is in for a major disappointment if he tries to resurrect the \u201csunshine policy\u201d of unconditional engagement pursued by previous progressive presidents from 1998 to 2008. President Trump has placed his hopes on Chinese promises to more fully implement U.N. sanctions. But as even he now seems to acknowledge, this hasn\u2019t happened. He tweeted on Tuesday: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi [Jinping] & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!\u201d Although Trump has criticized President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cstrategic patience\u201d policy as weak and ineffectual, he has yet to distinguish his North Korea policy from his predecessor\u2019s. Trump\u2019s policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d is anything but, and he continues to pull his punches against North Korean and Chinese violators of U.S. law. The Trump administration has also sent conflicting signals about whether it would negotiate with North Korea or potentially conduct a military attack to prevent the regime from mastering an intercontinental ballistic missile. Initiating a preemptive strike would be a bad idea against a state that already has nuclear weapons, as well as 10,000 artillery tubes aimed at Seoul. In our talks, the North Korean officials emphasized that they did not struggle to acquire nuclear weapons only to perish without using them. The implied threat was clear: If the United States were to use military force against North Korea, Pyongyang would retaliate, potentially leading to hundreds of thousands or millions of casualties. Instead of trying to preempt the North Korean nuclear weapons program, the Trump administration would be better advised to ramp up sanctions \u2014 including secondary sanctions, despite predictable Chinese protests. This would impose a penalty on North Korea, without risking a war \u2014 and could conceivably hasten the day the Kim regime finally collapses. Bolstering sanctions might not be exciting, but it would be a more pragmatic step than yet another attempt at negotiations. **Read more on this issue:** The Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s North Korea policy sounds like Obama\u2019s \u2018strategic patience\u2019 Andrei Lankov: The inconvenient truth about North Korea and China John Delury: Instead of threatening North Korea, Trump should try this The Post\u2019s View: The Korean threat is literally on parade.

The U.S.-backed coalition initially denied carrying out the air raid, which targeted a funeral attended by hundreds, but it released a statement on Sunday calling the bombing \u201cregrettable and painful\u201d and pledging an investigation. It also expressed \u201cits deepest condolences and support\u201d to the families of the victims.

In recent months, the Obama administration has faced mounting criticism for its backing of Saudi Arabia\u2019s air campaign in Yemen. Lawmakers and human rights groups have urged a ban on U.S. arms sales to Riyadh, declaring that Washington bears some responsibility for the civilian casualties in Yemen. The coalition\u2019s campaign has added to the civilian toll of the nearly two- year-long conflict between the Saudi-backed government and Shiite rebels. More than 10,000 people have been killed and millions are in the grips of a worsening humanitarian crisis. In Sanaa on Sunday, many of those protesting outside the offices of the United Nations were supporters of the rebels, known as Houthis, who control the capital and much of northern Yemen, and loyalists of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. They chanted slogans against Saudi Arabia and its royal family, according to local news reports. \u201cAfter this massacre, we are more determined to confront the assailants, _\u201d_ Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a well-known Houthi leader, told the protesters, according to the Agence France-Presse news agency. \u201cOpen the fronts with the Saudi enemy immediately.\u201d The Houthis and Saleh\u2019s supporters are fighting against President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was driven from the capital last year. Sunni Saudi Arabia has long been suspicious of the Shiite Houthis, who are widely suspected to be supported by Iran\u2019s Shiite theocracy, Riyadh\u2019s regional rival. Estimates of those killed in Saturday\u2019s airstrike ranged from 104 to 155, with more than 500 wounded, many of them critically. The funeral that was targeted was being held for the father of the Houthi-appointed interior minister, who is also a key ally of Saleh. The mourners included high-level officials but also thousands of civilians, according to witnesses. On Sunday, senior officials from the United Nations also condemned the attack, with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon demanding a \u201cprompt and impartial\u201d probe. \u201cThose responsible for the attack must be brought to justice,\u201d he said in a statement.

Just as the upside of the cyber domain is rippling out, with rapid and often unexpected consequences, so too is the downside. *[WSU]: Wayne State University The astounding numbers behind \u201call this cyber stuff\u201d drive home the scale and range of the threats: \u2014 9 new pieces of malware, malicious software designed to cause harm, are discovered each second \u2014 97 percent of Fortune 500 companies have been hacked (and the other 3 percent likely have been too and just don\u2019t know it) \u2014 and more than 100 governments have created military organizations to fight battles in the online domain. Alternatively, the problems can be conceptualized through the tough issues that this \u201ccyber stuff\u201d has already produced: But we too often lump things together that are unlike, simply because they involve zeros and ones. Take the idea of \u201cattacks.\u201d The lead U.S. general for the military\u2019s Cyber Command/NSA testified to Congress that \u201cEvery day, America\u2019s armed forces face millions of cyberattacks.\u201d[i] To get those numbers, though, he was combining everything from probes and address scans that never entered U.S. networks to attempts to carry out pranks, to politically motivated protests, to government-linked attempts at data theft and even espionage. But none of these attacks was what most of his listeners in Congress thought he meant by an \u201cattack,\u201d the feared \u201cdigital Pearl Harbor\u201d or \u201ccyber 9/11\u201d that\u2019s been cited a half-million times in the media and that his boss, the secretary of defense, had been warning them about in a simultaneous series of speeches, testimony, and interviews with the mainstream media. *[WSU]: Wayne State University Essentially, what people too often do when discussing \u201ccyberattacks\u201d is bundle together a variety of like and unlike activities, simply because they involve Internet-related technology. The parallel would be treating the actions of a prankster with fireworks, some street protesters with a smoke bomb, a bank robber with a shotgun, James Bond with his pistol, an insurgent with a roadside bomb and a state military with a cruise missile as if they were all the same phenomenon simply because their tools all involved the same chemistry of gunpowder. That said, there are most definitely growing capabilities to cause real and lasting physical damage via cyber means, with Stuxnet being a great illustration. It was like every other game-changing weapon in history in that it caused some kind of kinetic harm (a stone, a drone, a bomb, etc.). But it was also something new in that it was virtual in its means; it was just 0s and 1s. Being software, it was both here, there and nowhere simultaneously, hitting its target, but also residing in thousands of computers elsewhere. In the book, we explore how the next step in (cyber) war is integration, efforts like Israel\u2019s \u201cOperation Orchard,\u201d where both computer network operations and traditional military activities are blended together. It\u2019s the difference between having radios, tanks and airplanes in World War I versus the way they became powerful by being synergized in the blitzkrieg in World War II. **Edward Snowden has brought the issue of political oversight to the forefront. I was particularly struck by the parallels you strike in the book with civilian oversight over the nuclear program in the 1940s and 1950s. The Senate Armed Service Committee discovered aggressive military plans for preemptive nuclear attacks against the Soviets, which were luckily shut down before the 1960 Cuban missile crisis. You write: \u201cToday\u2019s leaders might want to ask if there are any cyber equivalents.\u201d What kind of equivalents are you worried about? What questions should be asked of whom?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University While the cyber arena poses, as President Obama said, \u201cthe most serious economic and national security challenges of the 21st century,\u201d it is one that we have proved to be woefully ill-equipped to handle. Indeed, as former CIA director Michael Hayden put it, \u201cRarely has something been so important and so talked about with less and less clarity and less apparent understanding. . . .\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University We can see this problem in everything from the public and mass media\u2019s confusion on matters from the NSA to the latest credit card hacks to Congress\u2019s inability to articulate anything worthy in this space, let alone take effective action. Indeed, 2013 marked the 12th year since Congress passed any significant cybersecurity legislation, the last time being 2002, half a decade before anyone had even heard of the iPhone, let alone today\u2019s world of metadata and Google Glass. *[WSU]: Wayne State University That chapter you cite in the book looks the fact that important plans and strategies for a powerful new technology are being made, but the broader civilian political system and populace has largely remained apart from the discussion. And if there is a historical parallel to the Cold War, it\u2019s in how civilian leaders nowadays, as in the past, might be caught off guard by some of the operational plans to actually make use of these new weapons, like the LeMay plan or the goofy U.S. Air Force discussion in 1957 of nuking the moon, just to show the Soviets that we could do interesting things in space, too. This gap is not just a U.S. issue but also is notable in states like China, where civilian control of the military is shall we say \u2026 far more complex. I think this also applies not just to the military operational side but also has played out in the surveillance side. Congress may have approved much of the actions of the NSA, but it was clear they didn\u2019t understand them or their ramifications, and that some ran with that. Similarly, it was reported that after General Alexander briefed Obama on NSA activities in the wake of Snowden, the president supposedly got frustrated and asked for it to be repeated to him, \u201cbut this time in English.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University **What do you make of the Snowden \u201cwhistleblower or traitor\u201d debate?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University The challenge of the Snowden revelations is that it involves a massive amount of data, showing activities that roughly falls into three categories: 1) Smart, strategic, useful espionage vs. American enemies, 2) Questionable activities that involved US citizens thru backdoors, fudging of policy/law, foreign agency collaboration 3) Un-strategic (stupid) actions that targeted close American allies, as well as the underlying network security and business prospects of American technology companies (who, according to Forrester Research, may lose as much as a $180 billion worth of revenue from this). So the problem in the discourse and debate on everything from how U.S. political leaders defended the programs to whether he is a traitor or a whistleblower is that people focus on one category but not the others. Government leaders talk about how such programs are critical to preventing another 9/11, but that doesn\u2019t assuage the Germans on why we spied on Angela Merkel. Or, in turn, you see human rights activists talk about how this was huge for U.S. public debate about the new meanings of the 4th Amendment in the cyber age, which is true, but that doesn\u2019t resonate to revelations of a program to spy on Chinese military research or Pakistani terror activities. The irony is that NSA should almost be glad that he disclosed all three categories, [since] if it was just the latter two, the present mess would be even uglier but more focused. *[WSU]: Wayne State University **You take a nuanced position on the degree to which cybersecurity issues demand involvement by governments (they do) and can be controlled by governments (they cannot, at least not fully). A point you make that I had not fully appreciated before reading the book is that the distribution of labor productivity in this area is highly skewed: A few extremely skilled programmers can achieve more than many programmers with average skills. Governments have advantages in that they can employ many but they may not be able to compete for the very best. What are the consequences of this? Will governments become more dependent on the private sector for sensitive security tasks?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University Yes, this is a space where quality matters. As the Silicon Valley firms can attest, the best programmers aren\u2019t just elite but can give you gains an order of magnitude greater than the average. But it doesn\u2019t mean that scale doesn\u2019t matter. The so-called \u4eba\u8089\u641c\u7d22, which roughly translates as \u201cHuman flesh search engine\u201d in China, has been very effective for its purpose of chilling public debate and online news that might not be regime friendly. For states, they have to understand that they are, as Joe Nye put it, still the \u201ctop dogs on the Internet,\u201d but that there are now many, many smaller dogs that can bite. Like the Internet itself, cybersecurity involves everything from states large and small to non-state organizations that range from Google to the Syrian Electronic Army to collectives of people who link up to share cat videos or conduct Anonymous campaigns to you and I. We all have both concerns, interests and powers. To your question of hiring, it\u2019s a good way of connecting to how at the end of the day both the problems and answers of cybersecurity are not about the software or hardware, but the wetware, the people behind the systems. Part of this is expanding our awareness, but it also goes to issues of workforce. For instance, we\u2019re finding only about 10 percent of the cybersecurity specialists that we need in the U.S. right now. Of the ones they\u2019re finding, hiring managers describe that they\u2019re only happy with the quality of about 40 percent. That\u2019s not a good situation, but it goes beyond the IT department. Whether you\u2019re working in the IT department or you\u2019re working in operations, legal, marketing or finance, wherever, you\u2019re increasingly going to be dealing with cybersecurity questions, whether it\u2019s managing people who work on them to your intellectual property, to your services, to your contract negotiations. This also means, though, that in that issue of both the human side and the government hiring the outside expertise, there are other drives we need to recognize, whether it be goals to build out your bureaucracy, your budget or your business. Again, there are real threats, but also the worry of a so- called \u201ccyber-industrial complex.\u201d In 2001, four companies were lobbying Congress on cybersecurity issues. Now it\u2019s over 1,500. The Washington Post even gave an article on the phenomenon the title \u201cGood News for Lobbyists: Cyber Dollars.\u201d *[WSU]: Wayne State University **How should universities reorganize to better meet the demand for people with cybersecurity skills?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University Whether you are the president of the United States, of a large corporation, a small business, or your household (when actually your spouse and kids are the true commanders in chief), all of us make cybersecurity decisions that matter. The problem is that we are not well trained and equipped for these new responsibilities. For instance, 70 percent of business executives have made a cybersecurity decision of some sort for their firms, despite the fact that no major MBA program teaches it as part of normal management training. This gap is mirrored at the schools we teach our diplomats, lawyers, generals, journalists and so on. Indeed, handing off a crucial matter for only the \u201cexperts\u201d to understand and handle is the best way to be taken advantage of, whether it is by a hacker accessing your bank account or by a spy agency that uses technical and legal doublespeak to haze what they are actually doing. In the book, we argue that it needs to stop being treated as just an area for computer science and better blended into the training for other fields. To put it another way, it is not a book just for the CompSci department, but for people in everything from international relations to law to business, much as cyberissues touch on all these fields. **What are the main obstacles for effective international cooperation on cybersecurity?** *[WSU]: Wayne State University **** Oh goodness, that could take another thousand words! *[WSU]: Wayne State University **** We need to move from only looking at this through Cold War visions and understand 1) the multi-stakeholder levels of play, and 2) that it is all about incentives. While in some areas we will have to be adversarial, as this is part of the realm of war and national security, we can still focus on shared interests, shared threats (what in Chinese is known as \u201cdouble crimes\u201d), build coalitions where possible, accept that sometimes these efforts won\u2019t involve all countries but that doesn\u2019t it make it not worthwhile to build core groups, and follow a strategy of \u201cgrafting\u201d onto treaties and agreements that already work (IE, build upon success, rather than trying to reinvent the wheel). Most of all, we need to raise the level of understanding and shared sense of responsibility, whether it be at the international level across national borders to how you handle cybersecurity issues at your office or your home. *[WSU]: Wayne State University [i] _\u201c_ _millions of cyber attacks\u201d_ Testimony before the House Armed Services Subcommittee, Cyberspace Operations Testimony, testimony of Keith Alexander, Commander of US Cyber Command, Sept. 23, 2010. *[WSU]: Wayne State University", "qid": 871, "docid": "a65431e09c13814cc8e7be4cd020903e", "score": 9.534899711608887}, {"content": "Title: Katrina vanden Heuvel: What to ask a secretary of state nominee Content: The nomination of a secretary of state gives the Senate the opportunity to probe the administration\u2019s foreign policy priorities \u2014 and many of President Obama\u2019s policies demand inquiry. Republicans like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who have disgracefully sniped at U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, have expressed few coherent reservations about our current course. Instead, it will be incumbent on Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 particularly Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Bob Casey (Pa.) and Tom Udall (N.M.) \u2014 to lead a responsible review. Here are only a few of the questions that senators could ask the nominee. \u25cf _Presidential war making_ : Are there any limits to the president\u2019s war powers in the so-called war on terror? Contrary to expectations, President Obama has broadened George W. Bush\u2019s view that the congressional resolution authorizing pursuit of al-Qaeda after 9/11 gives the president the right to attack any suspect group in any country of the world for as long as there are terrorists \u2014 or essentially forever. That prerogative is said to include the power to identify, target and kill anyone \u2014 including U.S. citizens \u2014 the president decides poses a terrorist threat to the United States. How would the nominee reconcile this assertion with the Constitution? How would he or she suggest the Congress enforce accountability on a president who mistakenly targets and kills an innocent U.S. citizen? \u25cf _Catastrophic climate change_ : Does the nominee consider global warming a clear and present danger to our national security? In his inaugural address, Obama raised the hope that we would begin to \u201croll back the specter of a warming planet.\u201d Some progress has been made, but the warming of the seas and melting of the glaciers have exceeded the most pessimistic warnings. Yet the United States was essentially AWOL in the most recent, failed climate negotiations in Doha. Does the new nominee foresee any change in this default? \u25cf _Global economic recovery_ : Does mass unemployment in the United States, recession in Europe and Japan and the risk of yet more adversarial trade policies from China require new international policies from the United States? The United States is pivoting to more austerity at home, even as economic growth here and abroad is faltering. We are headed toward a synchronized global recession with new trade and currency wars when what we need is a global synchronized recovery program. What steps would the nominee recommend to revive sustainable economic growth as a priority in global policy? \u25cf _Militarization of U.S. foreign policy_ : How can the State Department reclaim from the military its proper role as leader of U.S. policy abroad? The militarization of U.S. foreign policy has continued unabated in the first Obama term. Regional military commanders act as effective proconsuls, with far greater weight than ambassadors in regions across the world. Many countries know the United States only for its military bases, its military trainers or its drone attacks. Our foreign assistance budget is a global disgrace, while military spending is now higher than it was at the height of the Cold War under Ronald Reagan. What commitments have been made, if any, from the president in terms of correcting this wrongheaded imbalance? \u25cf _Afghanistan_ : Do you support the continued waste of lives and billions on the senseless war? And what will you do diplomatically to ensure that our exit is not delayed beyond 2014? Reports now are that the administration is planning to keep a military force of unknown size in Afghanistan past 2014, as well as pledging another decade of financial support for a regime that our own military calls by the acronym VICE (Vertically Integrated Criminal Enterprise). What are the limits you would advocate for this misguided commitment? \u25cf _Middle East_ : What should U.S. priorities be in the Middle East as the promise of the Arab Spring looks increasingly like the Arab Fall? We may be witnessing the collapse of the Arab state system that was held together by authoritarian governments for the last four decades at the same time we are seeing the collapse of any fig leaf of a peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Do you believe our \u201cIsrael right or wrong\u201d policy adequately protects this nation\u2019s security interests? Is it more or less important now for the United States to be seen as pushing for a fair settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with the establishment of a viable Palestinian state? \u25cf _Iran and nuclear peril_ : Do you believe our current strategy of ratcheting up sanctions, while keeping the option of the use of military force, is working to prevent Iran from joining Israel, Pakistan and India in developing a nuclear weapon? Is there a possibility that these threats are only accelerating Iran\u2019s nuclear efforts and helping to create a national consensus for a nuclear weapons capability? If deterrence has worked with other potential hostile states, why won\u2019t it work in the case of Iran? Do you think it is necessary to draw a \u201cred line\u201d \u2014 essentially threatening a military attack \u2014 to keep Iran from developing a bomb? In the past Iran has been supportive of U.S. policy in Afghanistan and has repeatedly said it does not want nuclear weapons, especially if countries like Israel give up theirs. Would you be willing to test Iran\u2019s interest in what is known as a Grand Bargain? This is far from the comprehensive set of questions that any nominee should face. This country faces monumental challenges that need to be addressed. It\u2019s time for the Senate to get beyond partisan cheap shots and exercise its constitutional responsibility to probe the president\u2019s nominee on whether and how the administration plans to move forward in an increasingly complex world. **Read more from Opinions:** The Post\u2019s View: Pulling the U.S. drone war out of the shadows The Post\u2019s View: A climate change deal Susan Rice: Why I made the right call Ruth Marcus: A quiet shove for Susan Rice David Ignatius: The case for John Kerry", "qid": 871, "docid": "eb9dead2-487d-11e2-ad54-580638ede391", "score": 9.496299743652344}, {"content": "Title: China\u2019s president urges Trump to use restraint over North Korea Content: After a week of threats and counterthreats between Washington and Pyongyang, Xi urged both sides not to do anything that would aggravate tensions, China\u2019s CGTN state television network reported. But North Korea continued to fuel tension Saturday, with the Rodong Sinmun newspaper reporting that almost 3.5 million people, including students and retired soldiers, have asked to join or rejoin the North Korean military to fight against the United States over the latest sanctions it encouraged through the U.N. Security Council. \u201cAll the people are rising up across the country to retaliate against the U.S. thousands of times,\u201d said the newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party. The report was almost certainly bluster rather than fact, but it showed that the North Korean regime is not backing down in the face of Trump\u2019s threats. Meanwhile, Japan finished installing surface-to-air missile interceptors in the western prefectures that North Korea said would be in the flight path of any missiles launched toward Guam, where North Korea is threatening an \u201cenveloping strike.\u201d In South Korea, the government began the environmental survey needed to complete the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system \u2014 a sign that the liberal government is now trying to expedite the deployment. In his phone call with Trump, Xi said China hoped the parties concerned would exercise restraint and refrain from taking any action that will aggravate tensions on the peninsula, according to CGTN. Dialogue, negotiations and a political settlement are the fundamental ways of solving the Korean Peninsula\u2019s nuclear issue, Xi said during the call, which took place Saturday Beijing time. \u201cThe Chinese leader expressed Beijing's willingness to maintain communication with the U.S. to appropriately resolve the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue,\u201d the network reported. Trump, who is scheduled to visit China later this year, on Tuesday threatened to respond to further threats from North Korea by unleashing \u201cfire and fury like the world has never seen.\u201d China has viewed the rising tensions between Washington and Pyongyang with some alarm and has repeatedly urged dialogue to lower tensions. Although China supported stiffer United Nations sanctions last weekend after repeated North Korean missile tests, Chinese officials also want a restart of six-party talks, which stalled in 2009. Those talks would involve North and South Korea, the United States, China, Russia and Japan. The war of words has given China the chance to project itself as the voice of reason and restraint while others lose their heads. It argues that Washington\u2019s long-standing belligerence toward North Korea helps explain why the regime has chosen to develop a nuclear weapons program \u2014 dodging its own responsibility for propping up the North Korean government. Xi \u201cstressed that China and the U.S. share the same interests on the denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d CGTN said. But China is deeply resistant to doing anything that could destabilize or topple the regime in Pyongyang. The Chinese government has worked to prevent a unified Korean state allied to the United States, going all the way back to the 1950-53 Korean War that saw hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers die. China remains North Korea\u2019s major trading partner, providing the regime\u2019s economic lifeline. In an editorial on Friday, China\u2019s state owned Global Times newspaper warned that China won\u2019t come to North Korea\u2019s aid if it launches missiles threatening U.S. soil and there is retaliation \u2014 but that China would intervene if Washington strikes first. \u201cChina should also make clear that if North Korea launches missiles that threaten U.S. soil first and the U.S. retaliates, China will stay neutral,\u201d the Global Times wrote. \u201cIf the U.S. and South Korea carry out strikes and try to overthrow the North Korean regime and change the political pattern of the Korean Peninsula, China will prevent them from doing so.\u201d As tension mounted this week, Japan prepared for the missile launches, which North Korea indicated could come this month. Two events could provide triggers. North Korea on Tuesday will celebrate \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d marking Japan's defeat in World War II and the end of its colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Then the United States and South Korea on Aug. 21 will begin joint military exercises, drills that North Korea considers preparation for an invasion. In announcing that it might simultaneously fire four intermediate-range ballistic missiles over western Japan toward Guam, North Korea listed the prefectures of Hiroshima, Shimane and Kochi as on the flight path. The Maritime Self Defense Force, as Japan\u2019s navy is known, already has Aegis destroyers ready to shoot down any missiles flying over, but the Air Self Defense Force on Saturday deployed Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles, which have a range of about 12 miles, to the areas Saturday in case the missiles come down over Japan. \u201cNorth Korea says it will target Guam, but it is possible that the missiles will fail to follow their programmed trajectories due to an error,\u201d a government official said, according to the Asahi newspaper. Meanwhile, the South Korean government on Saturday began a formal environmental survey about the THAAD deployment, which has been controversial in the southern rural area where it is stationed. Liberal president Moon Jae-in, elected in May, had vowed to conduct an environmental review of the deployment, which he had questioned while on the campaign trail. But the events of the last few weeks, especially North Korea's firing of two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month, have caused Moon to do an abrupt about-turn and he now appeared to be in a hurry to approve the THAAD system. Although this battery would not be able to shoot down long-range missiles, it is meant to protect South Korea from North Korean rockets aimed at them.", "qid": 871, "docid": "cc183e3c-7f1a-11e7-83c7-5bd5460f0d7e", "score": 9.431500434875488}, {"content": "Title: U.S. rejects Syrian request that U.N. inspectors stay longer, possibly delaying military strike Content: The Obama administration appeared Wednesday to be forging ahead with preparations to attack Syria. It dismissed a Syrian request to extend chemical weapons inspections there as a delaying tactic and said it saw little point in further discussion of the issue at the United Nations. President Obama said that \u201cthere need to be international consequences\u201d for the Aug. 21 chemical strikes he said he has concluded were carried out by the Syrian government. \u201cI have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria,\u201d Obama said in an interview with the PBS NewsHour, stressing that he has not decided to order a military attack. \u201cBut we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on chemical weapons they are held accountable,\u201d he said. A closed-door meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, called to consider a British-drafted resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent any further use of chemical weapons in Syria, adjourned without action after Russia and China opposed the measure. In response, U.S. officials made clear they considered such initiatives irrelevant to Obama\u2019s decision on military action. Although officials gave no indication of when a U.S. attack might occur, they said they expect U.N. inspectors to leave Syria on Saturday. \u201cWe see no avenue forward [at the United Nations] given continued Russian opposition to any meaningful Council action on Syria,\u201d deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. \u201cTherefore, the United States will continue its consultations and will take appropriate actions to respond in the days ahead.\u201d The U.S. dismissal seemed to put the administration and its allies at odds with the U.N. leadership. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, without setting a deadline or addressing the Syrian request for an extension, said it was \u201cessential to establish the facts\u201d and the U.N. team \u201cneeds time to do its job.\u201d Lakhdar Brahimi, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said international law requires a Security Council decision before any military action. \u201cI do know that President Obama and the American administration are not known to be trigger-happy,\u201d Brahimi said at a Geneva news conference. \u201cWhat they will decide, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, have said that any attack would be of limited scope and duration and would likely target military installations. The Defense Department has positioned warships armed with cruise missiles in the Mediterranean, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has said the military is \u201cready to go\u201d should Obama give the order. Russia and Iran, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s principal outside backers throughout the civil war that began more than two years ago, have warned of what Moscow has called the \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d of military intervention. France, which holds the fifth permanent U.N. Security Council seat, said this week that Assad should be \u201cpunished\u201d for the chemical weapons attack. British Prime Minister David Cameron has also strongly backed Obama\u2019s position on the need to punish Syria for the attack that left hundreds dead, and the two have consulted closely in recent days. Britain\u2019s resolution appeared to have been proposed with little expectation that Russia \u2014 which has vetoed measures condemning Syria in the past and this week questioned the attack allegations \u2014 would agree. Cameron also appeared to be running into difficulties at home as opposition grew to British backing or participation in a U.S.-led strike. Cameron called a special parliamentary session for Thursday to make his case and debate the issue. Bowing to political pressure, Cameron late Wednesday also called for a second session Tuesday to provide additional time for debate and a final vote. The government, Foreign Secretary William Hague said, recognizes \u201cthe deep concerns in this country about what happened over Iraq,\u201d when a previous British government, over strong public and political opposition, supported a U.S. invasion based on what turned out to be false evidence of weapons of mass destruction. \u201cWe will be clear that we are determined to take action against war crimes\u201d and the use of chemical weapons \u201con a consensual basis,\u201d Hague said. In what may mark the closing of the most immediate U.S. window of opportunity to launch a strike, Obama is scheduled to depart Tuesday night for Sweden, where he will spend a day before traveling to Russia for a meeting of the G-20 group of nations. The administration also hopes to release on Thursday a declassified intelligence assessment of evidence that it says will prove the Assad government\u2019s \u201cundeniable\u201d responsibility for the chemical attack outside Damascus. The U.N. investigators, charged with determining only whether chemical weapons were used, will not assess blame. \u201cNobody disputes, or hardly anybody disputes, that chemical weapons were used on a large scale in Syria against civilian populations,\u201d and the opposition does not possess the capability to undertake such attacks, Obama said. Asked what a limited military strike would accomplish, Obama said that \u201cthe Assad regime, which is involved in a civil war trying to protect itself, will have received a pretty strong signal that it better not, in fact, do it again.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t solve all the problems inside of Syria,\u201d he said. Obama added that Assad needs to understand that by killing civilians and putting neighboring U.S. allies such as Turkey and Jordan at risk, he was \u201cnot only breaking international norms and standards of decency\u201d but also had created \u201ca situation where U.S. national interests are affected. And that needs to stop.\u201d In a letter Wednesday to Ban, Syria accused opposition forces of attacking its military on three occasions this month with a poison \u201cclose to what we call the nerve gas sarin,\u201d the lethal compound the United States and others have said was used in the attack on rebel-held areas east of Damascus. The letter asked inspectors to extend their deadline for departure, originally scheduled for this weekend, to investigate that claim. In a scornful response, the State Department\u2019s Harf said, \u201cI think this call would have credibility if on day one or two or three or four or five, the Syrian regime had stopped shelling the area that they attacked to systematically destroy evidence, to cover up what they had done, and actually allowed U.N. investigators in.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to venture to gu
