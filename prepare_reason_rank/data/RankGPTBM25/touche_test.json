[{"query": "Should election day be a national holiday?", "hits": [{"content": "Title: Polling stations during Elections should be conducted over a longer period than a single day Content: 1. \"I often wonder if the single day voting is meant to curb voter fraud. No I don't think so. I think its discrimination against the poor\". Response: with all the avenues available on a single day vote (Internet at library, shelters, could provide other government locations) voting would not only be available to all Americans but it could be convenient. 2. \"...Those that have to work 2 or 3 jobs to survive and feed their family. Response: currently all states have a form of absentee voting (vote via mail, early, etc...). Here is a link to every state\"s absentee voting policy: http://www.ncsl.org.... Additionally, if the single day voting were a national holiday, that modification would eliminate work issues. Either way, every state in the country currently allows citizens to provide their work excuse and vote early. 3. \"Suggestion 1 to improve voting: I think that the first time people register to vote (age 18 or above) they should be required to give a fingerprint, than at least there would be a record to identify an individual without having to require a photo ID. I don't see how a fingerprint would be invasion of privacy and it would also be free. You only have to prove who you are once with a birth certificate or other suffiecient form of ID (barring any scaring on your fingers). If this database could be used solely for elections and not accessible to law enforcement (of course could we trust them?) You'd only know a person's finger pad pattern, not what they look like and people would not have to have a photo ID if they didn't want to.\" Response: with so much difficulty passing voter ID policies, logging fingerprints would prove implausible for two reasons. First, one argument against voter ID is that some have difficulty finding their birth certificate or other forms of ID. Second, many feel it is an invasion of their privacy and denies them their right to vote. Although I support voter ID laws, the fingerprint policy would be a step up in both categories. 4. \"Then, you could take your time to vote. Voting at your own convenience. Currently its just a tv spectacle with winners being declared often before even 50% of the vote is in for districts and states. Its not as if the switch from incumbent to the next elected official is happening that next day. Usually its like 3 months till the handover. Pretty much everything must kowtow to the tv networks. Too much money for tv. Sports are slaves to tv as well.\" Response: if the vote were done over a period of weeks, the spectacle and drama would be dragged out and exacerbated even more than it is now. For example, television shows such as The Bachelorette rely on this type of drama to generate ratings. Presidential elections that only occur once every four years would play right into this type of sensationalism. Additionally, the voting could not occur during the transition period between November and January. During this time, the president-elect needs to conduct business related to a smooth transition between leaders. Therefore, the vote needs to be finalized by early November, it cannot drag on for months. Although the Electoral College process does not officially elect the president until much later, there has never been a President-elect who was not officially elected by the Electoral College. 5. \"For those that want national ID cards or required photo IDs YET they want total privacy and no records to match who voted for who, you can't have both.\" Response: displaying an ID in order to vote but maintaining total privacy on the actual person the voter selected is completely possible. The ID provides the voter the ballot, the voter then votes privately. 6. \"Suggestion #2: Better yet, align voting and taxes then if you want to vote you have to pay your taxes (which should already be the case, even if you owe nothing or expect a refund) No taxes, no vote. Citizens benefit from services and infrastructure provided by taxes and it is their duty to pay them, voting should also be a duty of a citizen.(I agree both are duties, but like I argued in Round 1, apathy is the problem)\" Response: The IRS is currently backlogged as it is (see link below), so involving them in the voting process would provide an even more significant delay. Additionally, the IRS experiences tax evasion fraud as well as their own surveillance scandals (see link below), so convincing Americans to provide fingerprints would be next to impossible. Lastly, you mentioned single day voting being a burden on the poor. Surely attaching a financial requirement to the vote (albeit a legally assessed tax) could provide a disincentive to conduct both actions (paying taxes and voting) and could also create discrimination similar to post-Civil War poll taxes used to deny African Americans their right to vote. It also could provide the undue burden on the poor that you refer to at the start of your argument. IRS backlog link: http://www.cchgroup.com...

If we were to federally recognize national waffle day, Eggo would be primed to come back into the spotlight swinging.

Content: Whether or not Columbus Day should be celebrated lies in whether or not it is a national holiday. Thus, the resolution should read: Resolved: Columbus Day should not be a national holiday. Definition: Columbus Day: a federal holiday as declared by President Benjamin Harrison in 1892 celebrating the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. Framework: As my opponent has stated, the BOP for the CON is to show why Columbus Day should still be a national holiday. Thus, the BOP for the PRO is to refute the contentions presented by the CON and establish his own advocating why we should no longer make Columbus Day a national holiday. Additionally, read Contention 3 for the last part of PRO's BOP, where he must prove that there is bad INTENT in celebrating Columbus Day. --- Arguments: Contention 1: America has long admired Columbus Columbus Day marks the arrival of Europeans to the New World, and celebrates the \"beginning of a cultural exchange between America and Europe\"[1]. America has more Columbus statues and Columbus memorabilia than any other nation in the world. He's admired for his bravery in sailing West at a time when most uneducated believed the world to be flat. Contention 2: Columbus Day is the only day which recognizes the heritage of almost 26 million Italian Americans. Columbus Day became a national holiday in 1971 after Congress passed a law stating that the second Monday in October is Columbus Day. Along with the accomplishments of Columbus, the law passed in 1971 commemorates the arrival of over 5 million Italians a century prior. Columbus Day is thus the only day which recognizes the heritage of a group now nearly 26 million in size. Contention 3: Intent It is important as we judge this debate to consider the intent of Columbus Day. The intent, as defined, is to celebrate Columbus's arrival to the New World. Much like how Manifest Destiny didn't encourage the killing of Natives and much like how Independence Day doesn't celebrate the killing of British in the Revolutionary War, Columbus Day doesn't celebrate the deaths of Native Americans that may have ensued. It's a celebration of the discovery of the New World. In order for my opponent to win this round, he MUST prove that there is bad intent in celebrating Columbus Day. Unless he does so, he cannot win. This is added to his BOP. --- Refutations: ++represent my opponent's arguments ++\"It is in my opinion that Columbus's legacy is grossly misrepresented\"++ How has his legacy been misrepresented? He discovered two new continents, and that's what he's celebrated for on Columbus Day. ++\"His \"accomplishments\" was nothing more but a failed journey\"++ Again, how was it a failed journey? I understand that my opponent is upset over the deaths of natives that ensued after the discovery of the New World, but the intent of Columbus Day is to celebrate the discovery of continents on which 1 billion people now reside [2] [3]. When Columbus Day is described or taught in classrooms, it's taught as a celebration of discovery. No one is celebrating death on Columbus Day. Furthermore, Westward expansion and Manifest Destiny are two deeply rooted American beliefs, but as a result of them many Native Americans were killed. Should we remove the verse \"from sea to shining sea\" from the national anthem [4] because it hints to those who died in westward expansion? Should we no longer celebrate Independence Day because we killed many British and lost American lives during the preceding war? ++Columbus Day celebrates \"genocide and imperialism.\"++ Basically, my opponent is a) claiming that Columbus Day celebrates the deaths of Natives, b) imperialism is bad, and c) he is upset about it. My responses: a) that isn't the intent of the holiday. and, b) imperialism was the way of the world back then. c) the killing of Natives wasn't a genocide. The primary cause of death was smallpox, which was unintentionally brought from Europe to the Americas. Disease easily traveled across continents thanks to sea travel. and, d) Columbus was merely an explorer, actually didn't do much in the Americas except travel. He made four voyages and stopped at numerous locations on the Americas. It was the later conquistadors who were the ones who enslaved and killed natives on a large scale. The resolution has been negated. I thank my opponent for posting this debate and eagerly anticipate his responses and upcoming contentions. [1] http://www.osia.org... [2] http://en.wikipedia.org...

I believe that either the holiday should be abolished or that it should be renamed. Columbus' treatment of the natives was inhumane as his men murdered and raped members of the native tribes. In this country, we should categorize men like this as a murderer instead of a national hero. Let's begin by looking at how this became a holiday...it was a celebration by certain members of society because he was Italian and Catholic. His accomplishment of reaching America made him a hero in those communities. But how did he go from being a hero in the Italian and Catholic groups to being a hero in the United States? First of all, he did not \"discover\" America. Unless you ignore world history until this point, you know that there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed, so how can you \"discover\" something when there is already someone living there. Not only that, he never even touched down into the modern-day United States. He explored islands in the Caribbean and in central America, not in the present day United States. To give credit where credit is due, his explorations led to other European nations exploring the Americas and led to the colonizing of the Americas. However, that is not how Columbus is perceived is most parts of our society. My final point in this round is that there are only two holidays here in the United States that are named after individuals; Columbus Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Washington's birthday has been reduced to an overall President's Day. It appalls me that Columbus has a holiday named after him, but Washington, the father of our country, Lincoln, who in a round about way ended slavery, nor heroes like Pat Tillman have holidays named after them....you know, TRUE HEROES!", "qid": 44, "docid": "5666d2e5-2019-04-18T12:54:00Z-00002-000", "score": 9.628000259399414}, {"content": "Title: U.S. presidential primaries should be held on the same day in every state.

It does not recognize any other religious holiday in the same way. By recognizing and celebrating Christmas above all other religious festivals, the government is demonstrating a preference for Christianity above all other religions. My opponent has not bothered to argue this point, and so I assume he recognizes it as true. Con said: \u201cThe Federal Government does not force it's [sic] employees to \"celebrate this religious festival\". The paid holiday period can\u2026be ignored. If a federal employee views religious observance as an anathema to their ideology, they may choose to utilize their paid time-off in any non-religious fashion.\u201d Thank goodness! Imagine a state of affairs where citizens were actually driven into churches and forced to pray! You\u2019re right, Heineken. That would be much, much worse. It\u2019s bad enough, though, the government showing such a marked preference for Christianity and making all federal employees take a day of out of respect to a religion they may not follow. Con said: \u201cnot all Federal Offices close down for the Holidays\u2026 All Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines that do not submit an official request for Holiday leave, will be required to report for normal duty.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Heineken, that they don\u2019t stand down the entire military for Christmas, or indeed for any federal holiday. I suppose they keep the essential services running. I don\u2019t really see how that affects the argument, though. Con said: \u201cPro must show that\u2026mandatory leave is viewed negatively by the employee.\u201d You astonish me. I would never have thought you would put a citizen\u2019s feelings before his rights. Or that you would say freedom is about being positive. I disagree entirely, and for many reasons that are well outside the scope of this debate. I will only say here that this debate is not about people\u2019s emotions. It is about whether the US government should stop imposing religious observance onto its citizens in the form of the Christmas Day holiday. And yes, it should stop. ------------------ Con said: \u201cThe average Federal revenue for holiday sales in [sic] 565.5 billion dollars, which is a 565 billion dollar profit margin, after spending .5 billion on federal holiday pay.\u201d This is my favorite of all your arguments, because of the large sums of money involved and because of its ambiguity. What point are you trying to make here? If only there were an extra round, I could ask. As it is, I will take a few guesses at what your argument might be, and rebut them in turn. 1. Christmas day pays for itself. Non-Christians don\u2019t have to subsidize it. Actually, according to your own sources, \u201choliday sales\u201d mean all sales in November and December and \u201cHolidays during this period include Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.\u201d http://www.nrf.com...... In fact, there is no information here about how much money in taxes Christmas contributes specifically. In any case, the government encourages non-Christians to give gifts, send cards and put up Christmas trees. To contribute taxes, in other words. So whether it\u2019s though sales or income tax, non-Christians are subsidizing this religious festival. 2. We\u2019re so gloriously rich here in America, what difference does half a billion dollars make? Half a billion dollars is still a substantial amount of money. And it\u2019s the principle of the thing. Citizens can\u2019t choose whether or not to subsidize Christmas Day. The government makes them. 3. Christmas Day makes money for the government. Therefore, the government is right to encourage it. As you convincingly argued elsewhere, Christians aren\u2019t alone in having gift-giving festivals. The government doesn\u2019t need to mandate a federal holiday to rake in the benefits of religion. In any case, this is a distressingly cynical line to take. Surely religious freedom and equality are worth more than a seasonal rise in retail sales? ------------------ Con said: \u201cThe Jewish Holiday of Purim\u2026Hanukkah\u2026Eids\u2026Diwali far exceeds Christmas in extravagance and duration. The Chinese New Year celebrates elaborately with gifts and festivities.\u201d So true. So many wonderful cultural and religious festivals that thrive without government interference! Why can\u2019t Christmas be like that too? Con said: \u201cThe Jews do not celebrate Christmas, neither do the Muslims. The Indians also do not observe Christmas and cultural Chinese members of the U.S. also do not observe Christmas. In fact\u2026 80% of Americans observe the Holidays for non-religious reasons. Christmas is not religious, it's a commercial Holiday.\u201d I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, Heineken. Yes, the vast majority of Americans find no religious significance in Christmas Day. It makes sense, then, to replace Christmas with a secular holiday. Such as winter solstice. ------------------ Con said: \u201c I challenge my opponent to provide this official federal designation\u2026This is a straw-man argument. No such federal position, law, guideline or clause (no pun intended) exists.\u201d I\u2019m sorry. I did put the US government link in, but you had to find it on the list of links at the bottom, click on it, then scroll down to find the right bit. I should have just put in the quote directly. Here it is. \u201cChristmas is a Christian holiday marking the birth of the Christ Child. Decorating houses and yards with lights, putting up Christmas trees, giving gifts, and sending greeting cards have become holiday traditions even for many non-Christian Americans.\u201d http://www.usa.gov... What\u2019s a \u201cstraw man argument\u201d? It sounds bad, almost as if you\u2019re accusing me of making things up. But I\u2019ve included sources all along. Con said: \u201cIt should be noted that Christmas is not a national Holiday. Congress does not have the power to declare a national Holiday. It can only pass federal observance.\u201d Ah. So that\u2019s the difference between a \u201cnational holiday\u201d and a \u201cfederal holiday\u201d. Thanks. That\u2019s really interesting. Conclusion There are eleven federal holidays in the US. Only one of these, Christmas Day, is a religious festival. The government has no business showing such respect and preference to Christianity. The US prides itself on being a country of religious freedom. Federal holidays, which are compulsory holidays for all federal employees (in non-essential services), and which are subsidized by US tax-payers, should be secular and inclusive. Christmas Day should be celebrated by Christians in a private manner, just as people of other beliefs celebrate their own festivals.", "qid": 44, "docid": "5fa207c6-2019-04-18T17:59:10Z-00001-000", "score": 9.492600440979004}, {"content": "Title: The government should be doing nothing to encourage Christmas Content: Pro stated:\"On Christmas Day, federal government employees are forced to take a day off to celebrate this religious festival, and they are paid to do so.\" Rebuttal: The Federal Government does not force it's employees to \"celebrate this religious festival\". The paid holiday period can be observed, but it can also be ignored. If a federal employee views religious observance as an anathema to their ideology, they may choose to utilize their paid time-off in any non-religious fashion best suited to their ideology. In fact, not all Federal Offices close down for the Holidays. The Department of Defense requires it's employees to submit a request for Holiday-down time.

[2] The average Federal revenue for holiday sales in 565.5 billion dollars, which is a 565 billion dollar profit margin, after spending .5 billion on federal holiday pay. ------------------ Pro stated: \"No other religion is celebrated in this way, of course. Christmas Day is the only compulsory religious festival in the US calendar.\" Rebuttal: The Jewish Holiday of Purim is a big Israeli gift-exchanging holiday, but Hanukkah celebrates eight days of gift-giving in the North American tradition. The Muslims exchange gifts over two Eids in Ramadan as well. The Indian celebration of Diwali far exceeds Christmas in extravagance and duration. The Chinese New Year celebrates elaborately with gifts and festivities. Hence: The Jews do not celebrate Christmas, neither do the Muslims. The Indians also do not observe Christmas and cultural Chinese members of the U.S. also do not observe Christmas. In fact, while wikipedia reports that 78% of Americans are Christians, a recent Gallup reported in the \"Statistical Illusion\" article showed that only 20% of Americans are truly Christians, as defined by their Church. [3] That means 80% of Americans observe the Holidays for non-religious reasons. Christmas is not religious, it's a commercial Holiday. ------------------ Pro Claimed: The government designates the following Christmas activities as appropriate \"even for\" non-Christian Americans: Decorating houses and yards with lights, Putting up \"Christmas\" trees, Giving gifts, Sending greeting cards\" Rebuttal: I challenge my opponent to provide this official federal designation. Which federal law, passed in which year by what ruling body made the above list a federal \"designation\"? This is a straw-man argument. No such federal position, law, guideline or clause (no pun intended) exists. Federal observance of the Christmas Holiday was passed in 1870. It did not dictate how the holiday should be observed. Conclusion: It should be noted that Christmas is not a national Holiday. Congress does not have the power to declare a national Holiday. It can only pass federal observance. Non-government entities are not required to shut down for Christmas. \"Constitutionally, there are no \"national holidays\" in the United States because Congress only has authority to create holidays for federal institutions (including federally owned properties) and employees, and for the District of Columbia.\" [4] Lastly, it should be noted that getting time off for the Christmas season does not mandate Church attendance or religious observance. You are free to spend Christmas catching up on sleep, getting drunk, or like most Americans, try to take advantage of spectacular discounts on retail prices.

Be completely sold with the thought that Columbus and Columbus only was the one individual who desired to travel to the unknown territories of the globe. . 2. No one in the future would have had the capacity to pull of Columbus's task. . 3. Think that industrialization of nations is accepted by everyone to be an awesome thing.

At least they didn't commit genocide. . --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My responses to con's 3 main topics (1) Columbus's \"Discovery\" First of the \"discovery\" was an accident. Columbus had an entire crew behind him, (which he treated horribly) which right off the bat kind of makes it a bit dumb in the first place to give props only to Columbus. Most importantly the discovery is irrelevant. The main concern with which I have with Columbus Day and why I feel it should not be celebrated is purely for who Columbus was, what he ACTUALLY did, what his real intentions were. Which, sorry were frankly evil, imperialistic, and above all SHOULD NOT be honored with a national holiday. Con parades with the notion that the holiday clearly doesn't celebrate the deaths of native Americans. . To which I reply: No sh*t. That's not the point. The point is the holiday commends Christopher Columbus, who is historically DOCUMENTED as a complete sadist who did nothing but exploit and enslave. So no con, I do not have to prove malicious intent in celebrating Columbus Day, all I have to prove is why Christopher Columbus should not be honored with a national holiday.

Obviously my opponent could careless about who is honored nationally as long as they \"discovered\" something ( By accident) , it doesn't matter how many people or civilizations were wiped out in the process. .. (2) Genocide As much as my opponent may think he's have been \"proving\" he has really just been running away from my argument. I NEVER said that the intent of Columbus Day was to \"celebrate genocide\". NOT ONCE IN THE ENTIRE DEBATE! NOT ONCE! Con pulled that argument out of thin air. What I did say was. . \"It is in my opinion that Columbus's legacy is grossly misrepresented and that his \"accomplishments\" was nothing more but a failed journey riddled with genocide and imperialism. Thus, Columbus shouldn't be honored with a national holiday. \" Keep in mind that I have restated, and gave further elaboration to my very first argument in both rounds two and three. Con on the other hand has absolutely ignored his first two contentions and merely ran away with his third. (3) Malicious Intent I have repeated myself quite enough and I think by now con may get the picture now and stop pulling that argument out of thin air. As for his argument. . Again, if you sincerely believe that Columbus and Columbus alone is THE individual who is single handedly is entitled to be given thanks for the modernization of nations in the America's I'm afraid you're dead wrong. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *THE BOTTOM LINE* \"Columbus was merely an explorer, actually didn't do much in the Americas except travel. He made four voyages and stopped at numerous locations on the Americas. It was the later conquistadors who were the ones who enslaved and killed natives on a large scale. \" - Con (Face palm) . http://www.youtube.com... Disproven. Don't like RT? Think they're full of it?

Alright than, how about another source. . . http://www.youtube.com... So I'll ignore cons dead wrong perception of Christopher Columbus and grant him the naive proposition being that Columbus was a great explorer who should be credited with the discovery. Why would the U. S. , have national holiday for an explorer who notoriously is known for enslaving indigenous natives and engaging in genocide. Not only that, but above all never set foot in what would now be considered the United States OR even the continent of North America. .", "qid": 44, "docid": "7068d2b9-2019-04-18T18:58:24Z-00001-000", "score": 9.299500465393066}, {"content": "Title: Columbus Day Content: Good morning, noon, or evening!My name is arrowjaw. Today I will be participating in a debate in which I am the Pro, or the Affirmative. I am for the resolution. It is my burden to prove to you, the voter, that the resolution is true or should be carried out. It is also my burden to refute the arguments of the Con, or the Negative, who is against the resolution. Similarly, the opposition must prove to the voter that the resolution is false or should not be carried out. This debate has the following resolution:Should Columbus day be a national holiday in the United StatesMy opponent has set the character limit to 3,000, so I cannot structure an adequate debate. I will, thus, respond to my opponent only. My opponent begins by saying that Columbus day is a holiday because \"he was Italian and Catholic\". Italians and Catholics first lobbied for Columbus Day to become a federal holiday in the United States. This is in no a way a detriment to Columbus day. African-Americans were proud to be of the same heritage of M.L.K., and the rest of America admired him for his achievements. Columbus is the same. Just because his holiday was first urged on by members of his heritage does not mean that it should not be a federal holiday. My opponent says that \"[Columbus] did not discover America...there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed\". When people say 'Columbus discovered America', they are referencing that he discovered it for the more civilized and more technologically advanced part of the world: Eurasia and Africa. This is frankly a ridiculous and ignorant attempt to discredit Columbus for a monumental achievement. My opponent said that \"[Columbus] never touched down in the modern-day United States\". How can you blame him directly, place only the blame on him for all the deaths of the Natives of the Americas if, in your own words, he never even landed there. He paved the way for the colonization of the New World. He is not, however, responsible for the disgusting way in which the New World was conquered and colonized. My opponent then goes on to consent that \"his exploration led to other European nations exploring the Americas and led to the colonizing of the Americas.\" If that is not an achievement worthy of a holiday I do not know what is. My opponent has contradicted himself and consented, in his own words, that Columbus completed a monumental achievement, which is obviously worthy of, at least, a federal holiday. The Spanish Conquistadors may have killed millions in their conquests of South and Meso America, but that does not mean that Columbus is responsible for those deaths. Just as Karl Benz created the car but is not blamed for automobile-related deaths, Columbus should not be blamed for the horrific actions of others whom he had no control over.", "qid": 44, "docid": "5666d2e5-2019-04-18T12:54:00Z-00001-000", "score": 9.299200057983398}, {"content": "Title: Potato day should be a national holiday for all places Content: I love potatoes so potatoe day should be a national holiday if anyone disagrees give valid information why it should't", "qid": 44, "docid": "a9586a5-2019-04-18T15:18:07Z-00001-000", "score": 8.85319995880127}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: 'Vagina Day' should be a national holiday Content: I am arguing that 'Vagina Day' a day that would celebrate women, honor all the accomplishments of famous women, and honor all women in society today of hanging in there despite all the crap they take from both men and nature, should become a national holiday where businesses and schools take the day off and everything Con is against this resolution - First round is acceptance only. - 4000 characters - No pictures of Vaginas are to be posted.

Please see picture here: http://dustoffthebible.com... There are many, many Bible verses telling Israel and the future people of God after that era there would be signs in the heavens. We have a cosmic correlation straight back to the Nation of Israel's beginnings as the tetrad only appears on their established holidays. This could not be possible without invoking future for-knowledge. Remember, we can use technology and track the tetrad, but as humans we cannot start 1000's of years ago and predict them to continue on these established holidays. con: By calling out on your fallacy I have proven, or dismissed whatever pseudo-scientific claim you are making and invalidated your non-existent argument, since you are yet to provide any arguments for the title of this debate. How can this debate be related to the topic you are trying to argue, if you are not clearly stating your arguments relating to the topic in the first place? Pro: By firstly showing a supernatural reality displaying the most consistent cosmological pattern known to man corellating straight out of Israel that goes beyond scientific methodology, I am operating inside the parameters of 1.recorded prediction and instruction of star signs to Israel 2.Tetrad stands the test of time over the nations establishment and holidays 3. God of the bible's prediction to Israel in these regards is now observed through cosmology and recorded in history to be watching for them. ( See bible passages pertaining to star signs). By showing an esoteric/supernatural reality of The God of the bible unto observable Israel today, I can now put forth the case of Irreducible complexity of the scripture when studied line upon line precept upon precept as Isaiah the prophet instructs us. By doing so , we come across a case of Universals known to all men alive (sun moon sea day stars night) found specifically categorized in the prophetic/esoteric passages of scripture. For an example Judges 5:20 They fought from heaven (who fought in heaven?) ; (semi colon - Precept) the *stars (Angels) in their courses fought against Sisera. Revelation 9:1 And the fifth angel sounded his trumpet: and I saw a star out of the heaven fallen to the earth; ( semi colon /precept) and there was given to *Him the key of the pit of the abyss. He = Star = Angelic. Another universal everyone knows: Seas: Ezk 29: To the prince of Tyrus write Thus saith the Lord God; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the *seas: ( semicolon / precept) We all know that in the physical world there is no chair or throne sitting in the middle of the beach, nor can there be in this chapter because the entire chapter is followed with strictly political and economical subject matter. In the *prophetic passages, seas is always referred to seas of peoples nations cultures tongues. Jude 1: 11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. 12 These people are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; 13 --->Raging waves of the *sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars (There those stars again) , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever (predestined). I wrote all that to show you how in the prophetic/esoteric passages Seas = Peoples. Star(s) = Angels. ....Remember these \"universals\" ---> day moon night sea stars .....These words were also known as \"Tier words\" in scripture or hermeneutics by older theologians. Line upon line precept upon precept as instructed in scripture. i gave a few verses for those 2 words and I can give all of them ( in the high double digits) but, i think you can get the idea. I have not touched on the other universals known to all men such as day, moon, night as there is not enough text characters in this screen to allow. more on this topic can be found for novices here: and on an intermediate level here: and at an ontological level over all scripture at https://www.graceexplosion.com... in the teaching entitled \"The lost story\" which has a free option to download. ...So to the point of \"My opponent in no way shape or form links any of his arguments to the title of this debate\" I am putting forth the case inside scripture of a categorized series of universal hermeneutical algorithms that lead straight into the depiction of Zion/Heaven /1st estate before genesis creation and the problem going on when it was said to \" Let us make man in our image\". The end result is God re-created the entire race of Elohim/Angelic sons of God and the disembodies personaliteis of 1/3 Fallen Angels in hell into this earth realm matrix of redemption. This information goes beyond arguments such as \"is God evil\" as it reveals the reasons for why all the suffering in humanity. Jacob I have loved and Esau I have hated ...2 different nations going forth in the earth. Wheat from the tares. Sheep from the goats. Vessels unto wrath and vessels unto mercy. The elect and the reprobate. 10 commandments given to Israel alone, no objective given to Pharoah/Egypt. God favors one people and rejects others. It may seem God is arbitrary, only without understanding there is a huge problem going on. God is allowing as fleshlings the \"wheat and the tares\" to grow together cut off from anything Spiritual as it counts as a legitimate race. When it was said in Genesis to \"Let us make man in our image\" the end result is a world of believers and non believers. The face all humans are ascribed is already ascribed to either a Holy Angel in Heaven or fallen angel in hell. Angels do not have blood in their bodies. No punishment room in paradise. God is having mercy on His fallen sons by allowing a disposable, temporal, destructible duplicate version of them live in a world among the elect (Christians) where redemptive blood was shed. They will never believe or be saved in tis lifetime because of who they are in Spirit or essence. The will f man does not go under a microscope. After burning in hell night and day (time) forever and ever ends on the Last Day, they come through the fire saved when this book rolls up like a scroll (Revelation 6:14 - Isaiah 34:4) and there is \"no more night\" (Rev 22:5) and it is \"only day\" (Rev 22). Time has served it's purpose IE the book of life and the \"Day dawns\" ( 2 peter 1:19) . ... The angels are on reserve to judgement unto the \"Great DAY\" (Jude:1) ( Eternal plane) when God says \"Behold, I make all things new\" (Revelation 21:5). This is the case of irreducible complexity found in scripture line upon line precept upon precept explaining who mankind is and what is the purpose. As the title says: Mankind is the incarnated race of Holy and Unholy Angels con: I am tempted to accuse you of using the red herring fallacy, but I shall hold my words.

It would be illogical to assert that government legislation would deny people from observing similar customs that have a right to publicly practice. Holidays have an economic impact on businesses. By recognizing the source of these demands it behooves the federal government to utilize such observances for the benefit of economic growth. If the government made strides to eliminate the inclusion of holiday customs into their public persona, we risk killing the demand it generates. Seeing how the government can not create religious days, it only stands to utilize the days already commonly used by the populace. So much and more was stated by Ganulin vs. U.S. Supreme Court decision. [3] That the recognition of Christmas as a holiday, a custom practiced by the people, was not against the establishment clause. Government institutions were not establishing the practice, just recognizing it's prevalence. As such the name Christmas, was not elected by government either. Christmas was being called Christmas 4 centuries before the U.S. was created. It is only the name by which the holiday is known by. Christmas with the use of trees, Santa, reindeer, and present exchanges is a modern amalgamation of corporate advertisement, additions by different populations.

Content: My opponent stated that this date remembers the injustice done to aboriginals over the years, but it has s much more meaning then that. This is a day to celebrate how far we have come as a nation and what we have achieved since settlers have arrived in Australia. Bad things happened to aboriginals for many years, but we have grown from that which I, and many other aboriginals, think is the true meaning of Australia Day. I agree that the aborigines need proper recognition after all that has happened to them, but the 26th of January is a very important day for Australians and that shouldn\"t be taken away from us. Instead of changing the date, face the real problems in society. We should not forget the wrongdoings done to indigenous people when the English settled in Australia, but we should learn from the past and move forward from it. Aboriginals should be recognised as the traditional owners of the land, and then we should all move forward as a nation and celebrate the new era of our country, where changing the date of celebrating our nation should not matter. My position in this argument is against changing the date of Australia Day, a national holiday, celebrating all things Australian on the 26th January each year. The history of Australia is very significant in our lives and makes us who we are today. This date symbolises when Australia was first recognised as a country, and settled by the English. This era was a time of inequality and conflict between different groups of people, but we have grown from our mistakes and are now second on the UN\"s human development index. Australians have celebrated this holiday on this date for nearly 100 years. What better date could we choose to best represent our growth as a nation? The 26th of January reflects the origins of our country and the nation it has become. This date is and always will be an important date for Australian history, no matter what people choose to think. Changing the date of Australia Day cannot erase our history. No matter what, our history will always be a time of injustice. Instead of thinking about how awful aboriginals were treated, we should learn from that injustice and create a better place for everyone, which is shown on Australia Day. Australian Of The Year is awarded on this day, which encourages people to speak out about injustice in different communities and is a great time for everyone to remember the true owners of this land, aboriginals.

Content: Hello. I am glad to be debating you on this very controversial issue. I want to start off by saying that Columbus Day means much more than the discovery of America. It is more of a symbolic holiday - one that celebrates what was to come: democracy, freedom, the United States. I can see why you are against Columbus Day, and why we should abolish it. But I believe, firmly, that abolishing it is not only disrespectful but senseless. Let me explain. Although Columbus did not discover America, he did bring it into the limelight, the first to do so. The arrival of Columbus brought forth the beginning of recorded history in the Americas. This is an achievement worth celebrating. The arrival of Columbus also brings to light the achievements reached during the Renaissance. Discovering America allowed new exploration ideas to bloom. Discovering America permitted people to move and ideas to spread beyond the reach of Europe, Asia, and Africa. These ideas include innovations in agriculture, in medicine, in art, in music, in religion. And, most importantly, government. Columbus Day has been an important part of our past, another reason to celebrate it. The tradition of Columbus Day began in 1792 - the 300th anniversary of his first voyage. Many other historic events have occurred because of Columbus Day. The Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1892 to honor the 400th anniversary of Columbus. President Harrison declared Columbus Day a legal day that year. The US has also traditionally admired Columbus - the proof is in the facts. Look at all the cities named after him - Columbus, Ohio for example. The US also possess the most statues of Columbus in the world. If we are going to commemorate him with all these statues and cities, it stands to reason that we have a legal holiday to celebrate his major accomplishment. Should we rename Columbus and take down the statues because Columbus did not discover America? Also, Columbus Day is the only holiday the US recognizes the heritage of an estimated 26 million Italian Americans - which accounts for the fifth-largest ethnic group in the nation. All of these reasons were pulled off of http://www.osia.org.... This is a great website and outlines my argument perfectly. Now, I know what opponents of Columbus Day used as their reasoning - that \"Columbus is responsible for the enslaving of millions, and the death of millions due to illness.\"I argue against the reason - it is ridiculous. Let's see - America was responsible for the enslaving of millions of Africans. America was responsible for the death of millions of Native Americans. America was, and is, responsible for tens of hundreds of wars in which we kill millions to gain nothing. But does that mean we ought not to celebrate the Fourth of July? Or Independence Day? No, we ought to - it is a symbol of freedom. A symbol of hard work. A symbol of the great nation that was built from this land. In the same way, Columbus Day celebrates the introduction of new ideas into the Americas. It celebrates new innovations in medicine, in agriculture, in government. And while America wasn't really discovered by Columbus, he did bring it into the limelight. He was the first to do this with his voyage across the Atlantic and should remembered for it.", "qid": 44, "docid": "481724c0-2019-04-18T17:05:27Z-00002-000", "score": 8.522700309753418}, {"content": "Title: Politically Correctness is Politically Incorrect in itself Content: I'd like to use this definition of political correctness if that is alright. American Heritage Dictionary politically correct adj. Abbr. PC Of, relating to, or supporting broad social, political, and educational change, especially to redress historical injustices in matters such as race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. I think it is a little more clear than the one that you had proposed because for me it involves much more than simply describing ideas or beliefs. In fact, your definition actually excludes the situation that you were characterizing as offensive. Wishing someone a happy holiday or a merry christmas is much more than describing a set of ideas. So I hope we can agree to use my definition, and I will agree to focus this argument primarily on language, since that is what it appeared you are most distraught by. Now that I have outlined the framework I'll respond to your assertion first, before presenting my own support of politically correct language. To begin, I have never heard of a situation where someone was prevented from \"express your religion or beliefs\" due to political correctness. I have heard of a few situations where a local government was not allowed to recognize one religious holiday without due recognition to all religious holidays. This is not the same as what you are asserting. No one has stopped anyone from celebrating Christmas. (I'm using the Christian religion here, because that is the only way in which this critique could be situated as you'll see from my later arguments.) If it got to the point where people were forbidden from worshipping or celebrating Christmas, it would no longer be political correctness. At that point Jon Gibson would be right to call it a \"War on Christmas.\" Until then, it is simply an attempt to not allow the dominant religion to force itself on everyone in the country, state, county, township, whatever. Folks who aren't Christian shouldn't be forced to subsidize Christmas displays. That's political correctness on a policy level. To give you the benefit of the doubt, I'll assume that you're talking about a personal level using the terminology Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. If you say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas, how does that prohibit you from expressing your own religion or beliefs? Is Christmas not a holiday? The point of politically correct language is that it is all encompassing. Even atheists will celebrate the New Year, which is included in \"Have a Happy Holiday.\" So I think that it does absolutely no damage to the Christian speaker to say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas. To further this discussion, I think it is a positive thing to recognize the existence of other holidays. This country may be majority Christian, but that does not mean that it is a \"Christian Nation.\" There is a first amendment freedom of expression clause, which means that folks are legally able to choose their religious identity. Even though, this is not a Christian Nation, non-Christian folks are still largely excluded from public life. We've never had a non-Christian president, and you can count the Senators that are non-Christian on a hand. This creates a whole society that ends up working against the interests of non-Christian folks. Our work day is clearly not geared toward Muslims who have to pray five times a day. We adapt and tolerate, but it's far from an attitude of genuine inclusion. This current \"War on the War on Christmas\" is simply an attempt to compound the privilege of Christians and further entrench Christian supremacy in this society. I feel that it is a much better thing to recognize the existence of other religious traditions and religious holidays and not further marginalize folks who aren't Christian. Further, I think there are many more benefits to political correctness that go beyond the issue of religion. It's politically correct to not use racial slurs or sexist jargon. Is that also keeping people from expressing their beliefs? If that offends racists and sexists, I'm alright with that. Dominant groups should not be afforded the additional privilege of using language to further lower the self-esteem of marginalized groups. Instead, this nation of \"E Pluribus Unum\" (Out of many, one) should work to build as inclusive a society as possible. Politically correct language is one part of that. The broader project, which was outlined in my proposed definition, is the overthrow of structural impediments to realizing this society that allows people the freedom to define themselves and not suffer any setbacks because of how they choose to live.", "qid": 44, "docid": "a1b052be-2019-04-18T20:00:52Z-00002-000", "score": 8.508899688720703}, {"content": "Title: Autumn Regular Tournament: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory Content: Thanks, Philo. =Pro case=FrameworkPro argues that the only concern that should govern policy is if that policy is \"democratic\". This is absurd--democracies are governments and as I articulated in my framework, governance is fundamentally a balancing act between individual rights and the common good. Good governments are ones which make acceptable trade offs on this scale. Pro never explains why we should care if a democracy is \"good\" or not. It's vastly preferable to be ruled by a just king than a tyrannical president. It's vastly preferable to disenfranchise the 51% that would vote to exterminate the 49% even though this would be less democratic. Good governance is more important. The question then becomes if the practical effects of compulsory voting outweigh its violations of individual autonomy and as we will see, the answer is clearly no.I. TurnoutI do not concede that high voter turnout is inherently good. In Weimar Germany I would've preferred the Jews had higher turnout than members of the Nazi party did, regardless of what the actual opinion of the broader electorate was. We should value good government, not necessarily whatever happens to be the most \"democratic\" policy. Ironically, Pro argues that democracy means \"all\" the people are involved in the governing process and then immediately contradicts himself by arguing that certain people are unfit to rule. This is a huge blow for Pro because it destroys his argument about how democracy is a joke is we don't involve everyone. I don't want people who can't name the vice president to decide elections. Pro argues that if everyone doesn't vote a government doesn't have a mandate. There's no evidence Pro cited of governments under compulsory voting regimes having greater legitimacy than governments who don't force their citizens at gunpoint to endorse the system. Outside of nations with compulsory voting it's incredibly rare for the outright majority of eligible voters to endorse the ruling party but this has no effect on the governments ability to rule. Pros argument here also assumes a two party system--in a multi party system it would be incredibly unlikely for the winning party to gain a majority even with compulsory voting. Are these governments any less legitimate? Pro certainly hasn't proven so. Considering that he brings it up later Pro clearly puts great stock in his mandate argument but I genuinely don't know how to reply because it's simply not warranted at all. Where are all challenges to sovereignty to these governments without mandates? The strongest language from Pro on this contention is that a plurality rather than a majority \"somewhat\" contradicts democracy. This timid, unassertive word choice is extremely telling--even Pro himself can't get himself to fully commit to this argument. Even if you buy that high turnout is good, state coercion is just not the best way to achieve this goal when we have options like tax credits. II. Accessibility to votingAbsolutely nothing in this contention is unique ad governments can easily pass laws that remove hindrances to voting. Making election days national holidays, extending early voting and same day registration are all discussed and worthy reforms, but compulsory voting is manufacturing a tornado to blow out a match. In fact, I can easily turn this argument: It IS hard to vote sometimes, but nothing in the resolution presumes that issue will be resolved. Pro only gets to assume that he succeeds in adding a legal obligation to vote, not that he makes it easier to vote. He's going to punish all of those hard working or disabled people he lauds. III. EducationPro has no evidence linking compulsory voting with a better educated electorate. Pro says that in a free society it's easy to ignore politics but thinks that forcing people to show up once every four years to randomly select candidates would turn us all into political junkies. In the United States, the election is all anybody hears about on the news for about two years before it even happens (this process has already begun). Social media, Internet access, and incessant news coverage make it almost impossible to not learn about politics through sheer osmosis. If people are tuning out, it's for a reason--probably because they realize that their vote doesn't matter in the slightest and have more important things to do in their lives than to listen to corporate shills lie. There's absolutely nothing in our modern world that stymies our natural curiosity, compulsory voting wouldn't make a difference. IV. ExtremismPros card on extremism refers specifically to primary elections[1]. Primary elections are the elections where party members select the slate of candidates for the general election--compulsory voting wouldn't solve for this because voting in primaries will *always* be voluntary unless Pro wants to argue that the government should force people to join political parties. The solutions suggested by the article, such as voting by mail and same day voter registration are far superior to Pros plan. I can't emphasize this enough, the article specifically lays the blame for polarization on primary elections so Pro gets no impact here--only solutions that increase *voluntary* turnout (like tax credits) would help here. Moreover, other than the weak democracy argument Pro doesn't explain why having politically motivated people voting more often is a bad thing, nor how having representatives with convictions (\"extremists\") is a bad thing. The article cites the example of Chris Murphy who won a low turnout primary and quickly became one of the most liberal senators and just assumes this is bad. Why is having one of the most liberal states in the country represented by a liberal a bad thing? Pro doesn't seem to understand that the moderates that are \"unrepresented\" voluntarily ceded their right to vote. They aren't underrepresented because they never seeked representation in the first place. The election of ideologues and extremists is often an act of protest. It's likely that compulsory voting would actually increase the probability of electing ideologues as leagues of potential voters who sit out elections out of disgust would now be forced to make a choice.=My case=CounterplanPro argues that my plan of tax credits would cost money. Actually it would grow the economy due to the multiplier effect. The multiplier effect is a phenomenon whereby investment in certain sectors yields returns that are higher than the initial investment. So if a multiplier was 1.1, an investment of 1 billion would yield 1.1 billion. A paper for the United States Conference of Mayors[2] explains that the Earned Income Tax Credit for low to moderate income earners, a payment similar to my voting tax credit proposal, has a multiplier somewhere between 1.5 and 2. Pro claims that a tax credit would cost a lot of money. On the contrary, the credit would grow the economy by something between 1.5 and 2 times the money put in. This is a completely independent reason to vote Con. Even if you don't see any ethical or practical issue with compulsory voting, Pro doesn't grow the economy. I do. I. UndemocraticPro cites a poll showing Australians favor mandatory voting. He asks \"[Why] should the statistic from the USA take precedence over the statistic from Australia?\" It shouldn't! That's exactly the point! Somehow Pro entirely missed the crux of my argument, which is that the resolution should be rejected as it's better to let nations decide their own policies for themselves. This is the democratic position. Australia is not mine to rule, and while I think I could make convincing arguments to them as to why compulsory voting is bad policy, ultimately the decision is up to them. Pro, on the other hand, believes that nations he has never heard of and knows nothing about have a moral imperative to implement this policy even if it would be disastrous for them. Pro totally missed the point of my neocolonialism argument. The problem with his position is its blanket assumption--the issue is with this concept that nations we couldn't identify on a map are ours to rule. This type of hubris, that we can legislate just as well for anybody as we can for our own nations and that our policies have to work for them is the type of thinking that led to colonialism. Reject colonialism. Reject the resolution. Let nations decide their own policies for themselves. Despite his emphasis on democratic ideals, this autonomy is by far the more democratic position. II/III RightsPro does not argue that these rights don't exist, he just argues that people can just spoil their ballots. This isn't always true--it's unlikely, for example, that one could spoil their vote in electronic voting machines that wouldn't allow you to select more than one candidate. Moreover, many people wouldn't know how to spoil their votes or would believe it to be illegal (\"Is it illegal to spoil your vote?\" brings 125,000 hits on Google). To make sure that none of these rights are violated would require a concerted effort by the government to bring to the voters attention their ability to spoil their ballots, which defeats the purpose of forcing them to vote when they could just allow them to abstain instead. Moreover spoiling your ballot is not a true act of political neutrality--spoilt ballots are typically viewed as protest ballots[3]. The only truly neutral act is to not vote. Pro does not dispute that we should use the Sherbert Test: forcing people to violate their religion and hoping that they'll know to spoil their ballots is not the *least intrusive* means of achieving high turnout. Allowing them to abstain and encouraging voluntary voting through tax credits is.Pro removes legitimitate means of political expression and forces us all to give consent to the system. I'll discuss the rest of my case and crystallize the debate in the next round. 1. http://tinyurl.com...2. http://tinyurl.com...3. http://tinyurl.com...", "qid": 44, "docid": "790c6317-2019-04-18T14:20:46Z-00002-000", "score": 8.503899574279785}, {"content": "Title: Christmas should be cancelled Content: Thanks for your post, and allow me to wish you seasons greetings. This is my very first debate, so I apologize in advance for any procedural errors. From your opening remarks, I am not sure whether you are advocating for the removal of Christmas Day as a public holiday, or arguing for the complete ban of Christmas celebration altogether (or both). My confusion stems from your point # 3 regarding the stress caused by shopping for Christmas, advertising, etc. I do not see what effecting removing Christmas as a public holiday would have on shopping stress or advertising. Your clarification here would be appreciated. That said, and to be on the safe side, I will argue against canceling Christmas altogether, and hopefully address the public holiday issue in the process. I will first make my case for not canceling Christmas, and then attempt to rebut your arguments. C1-It is not necessarily religious. It is true that the historical roots of Christmas stem from the religious tradition of celebrating the birth of Christ, but if one looks back at the tradition even farther, the pre-Christian origins of the winter celebration are clear. [1] Over time, Christmas has certainly become increasingly secularized. It has evolved into more of a cultural event focused on joy and giving, rather than a strict religious observance. This is supported by the US Courts when addressing suits brought on by those seeking to end Christmas as a public holiday due to the establishment clause of the US Constitution. The courts ruled that Christmas, \"has a valid secular purpose, it does not have the effect of endorsing religion in general or Christianity in particular, and it does not impermissibly cause excessive entanglement between church and state.\" [2] Christmas is at a point now where it can be comfortably celebrated by Christians and non-Christians alike. I have many non-Christian friends who vigorously engage in Christmas celebrations. Why even the renown atheist Richard Dawkins celebrates the holiday. [3] C2-Charitable giving increases during the holidays Surveys show that charitable giving increases during the holiday season. I acknowledge that the reason for the increase might be due to many factors not necessarily associated with Christmas (last minute donations for tax purposes, needs of the poor due to cold weather, etc), but it is clear that a tradition of giving during Christmas has a significant impact in increased donations. [4] C3-Economic Benefits My arguments for the economic benefit of Christmas will be addressed as part of my rebuttal. C4-It's just plain fun People derive great joy from the traditions associated with Christmas. Here are just a few examples: \u2022 The eager anticipation of the holiday \u2022 Family and friends coming together \u2022 Great food (and drink for that matter \u2013 I love eggnog) \u2022 Singing Christmas carols \u2022 Exchanging gifts \u2022 Trimming the tree \u2022 Mistletoe \u2022 Sharing the joys of laughter and good cheer And if you are really against the whole Christmas celebration, the good news is that participation is optional. Rebuttal \"1 \u2013 The vast majority of people in the West do not practice Christianity: the United States has the highest number of churchgoers for a developed nation at 25%, whereas in Northern European countries church attendance ranges between 3-12 %. Why then is a celebration associated with a religious minority foisted upon the entire nation?\" Church Attendance is not a pre-requisite of Christianity. A person is a Christian if they consider themselves a follower of Christ. How they chose to manifest that personal designation is, well, personal. The bottom line is that Christians are not a minority in the US or UK. 76% of the US population [5] and 72% in the UK [6] consider themselves Christian. \"2 \u2013 As businesses shut down for Christmas Day the lost productivity costs industry trillions of dollars: the GDP of the European Union and the United States alone is USD30,533,747 million which means that Christmas costs US and EU firms $83.65 trillion dollars every year.\" It is unreasonable to assume that GDP in the US and the European Union comes to a complete stand still on Christmas day. I can tell you from personal experience that I've unfortunately had to work on Christmas Day several times. The truth is that Christmas has a huge beneficial impact to the economy as Kathleen Antriim's column outlines [7]. If we were to end Christmas, consider all of the retail, manufacturing and ancillary business that would be effected. Furthermore, if you are seriously complaining about the net GDP loss for declaring a public holiday, should we not also get rid of New Year's Day as well? \"3 \u2013 Shopping for Christmas presents is not only enormously stressful but parents are encouraged by advertisers and through peer pressure to spend more than they can afford on gifts for their children: 52% of families with low and middle incomes turn to high interest debt to cover the cost of Christmas; money that would be better spent on their children's health and education\" You've obviously never met my wife, as she actually considers Christmas shopping a relaxing experience. It sounds like your gripe is with stress, advertising, peer pressure and people who spend irresponsibly. The mere fact that Christmas is involved does not warrant its removal. People get fat from eating too much food, but food is not the problem, people's behavior is the problem. Cancelling Christmas is not the solution. People taking personal responsibility is. I can absolutely guarantee you that if we end Christmas, people will still get stressed, people will still experience peer pressure, people will still spend irresponsibly, and advertisers will still advertise. It is unfortunate, but true. Conclusion Christmas is enjoyed by a vast majority of people, Christian and non-Christian alike. We should embrace it as a wonderful time of year. Let the kids open their presents on Christmas Morning, and let Mom & Dad have a day off so they can join their kids in the celebration. Sources [1] http://en.wikipedia.org...

The difference of course being if you label yourself as an atheist, rather than agnostic, undecided or even of a minority faith within the populace, you are actively of the belief in the REJECTION of a God/deity and therefore of any religion which concludes the existence of a God/deity. The act of rejection is to dismiss or refuse, so surely anything other than dismissal or refusal to participate within religious celebration is in itself hypocrisy. In relation to the other mentioned religiously based 'holidays' it is also hypocritical for an atheist to participate within their celebrations. St. Patricks day is misconstrued as a day to celebrate being 'irish' it is in fact a celebration of the catholic patron saint of Ireland st. Patrick, who is being celebrated for bringing Christianity/Catholicism to the people of Ireland. Irish people who celebrate this day are not just celebrating the fact that they are irish, but the fact that they are irish Catholics. This holiday was brought to and popularised in America due to the number of Irish Catholic immigrants who have settled there. As someone who is from Ireland and was born in Belfast, I can categorically tell you that in Ireland only irish Catholics actively participate in the celebration of st. Patricks day, irish Protestants for instance refrain from celebration as they reject the ideology. St. Valentines day is slightly more ambiguous but still nether the less is a solely religiously based idea, st. Valentine was a Christian priest or bishop in the 3rd century who (although not absolute historical fact) was executed by roman Claudius II, for conducting marriages which had been outlawed, it is claimed that on the day of st. Valentines execution on February 14th that he sent a love letter to a lady signed 'from your valentine'. Valentines day is also related to an earlier pre Christian holiday Lupercalia, a celebration of a roman God. Halloween, known by Catholics as all saints eve/night, is a catholic religiously observed holiday it's roots are heavily based in celtic mythology and paganism and is a holiday which has again been bought to and popularised in America by its irish/Scottish immigrants, it is totally religiously based. In America however the lines have been blurred for many religious holidays, as America is a capitalist nation, it Capitalises on such holidays for financial gain, rather than there true meaning of religious holiday, corporations, company's and media outlets promote aspects of religious holiday to 'all' within society as means of making money from them. This however does not change or alter the fact that they are religious holidays which celebrate the belief in a religion which promotes a God/deity theory, which atheists actively reject. As I made clear in my first argument, I am not suggesting that to prove ones atheistic beliefs they should deliberately offend the populace, but that to participate within or to benefit from the celebration itself is hypocritical to the beliefs and ideologies of atheism. Atheism ironically is classified as a religion, and to classify yourself as an atheist is making a 'statement'. I would assume that as you have taken up the con position to this debate that you are an atheist, therefore are making a statement that you are in rejection to the belief of the populace, so in claiming that you can still continue to participate with celebration of the populace's religious holidays, which are inevitably a celebration of religious scripture, doctrine and of the idea that God does infact exist, is undoubtedly hypocritical. So onto ownership of the holiday of Christmas, it can almost certainly in modern history be seen to be owned by Christianity, irrespective of wether or not it was the actual birth date of Jesus, it is what is being celebrated. Denial of this is nonsensical, to deny that you are celebrating the birth of Jesus because historically Jesus may actually have been born on a different date is simply silly, wether Jesus was born on December 25th or not, Christmas is still ultimately the celebration of his birth, so ultimately a celebration of Christmas is the celebration of Jesus/Christianity. Another argument atheists may have, is that prior to Christianity's influx into Europe an extremely similar holiday took place around the same time the 'winter solstice' and that Christianity adapted this holiday to fit in with the changing of beliefs of the new converts. This is true, it is extremely likely that Christianity took the winter solstice and changed the ideology into representing Christian values rather than pagan values. But this argument in itself makes no difference if you are indeed an atheist, because the winter solstice itself was a religious festival/holiday which was celebrating the belief in a God/deity by pagans, and would be contradictory to the belief in atheism. As I have previously stated there can be no rebuttal to the question, 'is an atheist celebrating Christmas hypocritical' it is fundamentally hypocritical, it is however a hypocrisy that is accepted amongst atheists, an argument of if you can't beat them join them ect does not make you any less hypocritical for doing so.", "qid": 44, "docid": "2080394b-2019-04-18T15:35:04Z-00003-000", "score": 8.456700325012207}, {"content": "Title: It's time to restore our traditional mid-winter festival to its former glory Content: While I am as much a \"Scrooge\" as my opponent, I will be arguing as to why we should not bring Yuletide back. Please keep in mind that my position is not focused on asserting that Christmas should be upheld, but rather that Yuletide should not be instituted. First, the whole issue begs the question as to what holidays are. Basically, they're celebrations of ideas society, or a particular culture, agrees with. Especially if you approach this from a secular point of view, where \"truth\" and \"values\" are impossible to establish, then everyone's opinions go. What matters is who is in the majority. The minority can yell all they want, but until they have some form of leverage, the opinion of the powerful is upheld [1]. Now, times have certainly shifted in the Western world. It may, in fact, be time for relativism and secularism and secularism to assert their gaining power, and overthrow some of the Christian traditions and strongholds. However, overthrowing Christian ideas is not what we're here to argue. The argument is that Yuletide, a pagan, spiritualistic celebration should be brought back into the mainstream. On what grounds would we discard one religious celebration for another, even more mystical one? If the grounds for overthrowing one system was that it exerted it's power in society, replacing it with another system that makes proclamations would simply transfer said power, leaving us with the same problem [2]. If the grounds for overthrowing the current system is because it is based on false premises, than on what grounds are we to bring back Yuletide, an arguably more superstitiously based notion? But not only does Yuletide fail to reflect our current society's value for intellectualism, it significantly conflicts with our modern day value of work. While schools would be largely unaffected by a twelve day holiday, how fitting would such a holiday be within the context of Wall Street? While we could institute Yuletide and only allot one or two days for it's official, national celebration, what then would be the point of bringing back a twelve day holiday and calling it superior to a one day holiday? Yuletide just doesn't fit in with the way our modern world works [3]. As we clearly see the lack of Yuletide spirit that could be garnered in our modern society, one sees the real problem my opponent has with this time of year, as he states, \"Of course, going forward, we should still keep the seasonal greetings cards; the gifts; the roast turkey with all the trimmings; the champagne, port and brandy and the decorated trees \u2013 they have no connection with Christianity at all.\" My opponent really isn't arguing for the legitimacy of Yuletide, but rather for the decommissioning of the Christian sector's power. Now, that would be a fine discussion to have, but it has no bearing as to whether Yuletide should be brought back to a culture that is significantly different, will bring in traditions that make original Yuletide relatively unrecognizable, etc. I thank my opponent for thinking critically about why we celebrate the things that we do, although I remain firm in the opinion that his resolution is not a fitting one.

Content: Hello and thank you for accepting. This is a debate about whether Christopher Columbus should be \"honored\" with a holiday, and therefore this debate is about whether he should be honored, and not about the holiday itself. For the sake of organization and to assure that no point will go unheeded, I will quote each of your points and then provide my rebuttals. <<\"My first contention is that Columbus day isn't celebrating christopher columbus, but rather his achievments Making knowledge of the Americas known\">> This contention is valid, yet outside the range of this debate. If you will notice the resolution, it is not whether we should have a holiday to celebrate his achievements, but whether we should have a holiday to honor him. This debate is about whether he as a person is worthy of being honored with a holiday. Not whether we should have a holiday to celebrate the events leading to American independence. Saying that Columbus has merit, because his actions very indirectly led to the existence of the United States, is akin to giving Hitler merit because his actions indirectly led to the formation of The United Nations. The United Nations was formed after WWII so that a diplomatic crisis such as a world war would not occur again. Since Hitler played a large part in the starting of World-war II, he \"paved the way\" to the UN. So basically, having a holiday to honor Columbus is about as sensible as having a \"Hitler day\" on September first (the day he invaded Poland). http://www.un.org... <<\"My Second Contention is that the Affirmation isn't fairly portraying Columbus.\">> I gave the general gist of what Columbus did: went across the ocean driven solely by self-gain, found aborigines, and then used them for his self gain, by using them as slaves and using them for gold. The ONLY \"good side\" that you can attest for in his nature is that his actions inadvertently set off a chain reaction which led to the US. This does not contribute to the virtue of his personality or good-intent of his actions in any way. It merely illustrates that horrible actions from people like Columbus can accidentally bring good things\u2026centuries later. The comparison to the Fourth of July does not fit for the following reasons: 1. The Fourth of July celebrates the independence of the US, not the guy who wrote the declaration of thus. It is not \"Jefferson day\", but \"The Fourth of July\". Unlike the holiday which is implied by the resolution, the Fourth of July celebrates the instance that was incurred by the man, and not the man himself. 2. While Thomas Jefferson had many quality attributes, Columbus had none worthy of note \u2013nor have you denied this- but the persistent idea from you that he should be honored because his wickedness inadvertently led to the independence of America 300 years later. This however is not an attribute to his nature as a person, but the fortunate turn of events that history took. Thomas Jefferson had many virtues and his motive was pure, unlike Columbus who acted merely on the Motive of self-gain. Morality and virtue can only be measured by the intent with which actions are partook, and not the consequence of said actions. <<\"My third contention is that actions such as slavery were acepted at the time, and according to Spanish Monarchy during the 1400's Native Americans were not deemed people, so in essence he wasn't doing anything wrong in the eyes of his time period.\">> You have seemingly made this assertion about the time period with no backing. And my guess is that you aren't exactly an expert on the 1400's, either. With some research you will find that the very nature of the documentation of Columbus' grievances denies that slavery was the morally accepted standard of the time period. Much of what we know about the matter stems from what is written by Bartolome de las casas, who thoroughly opposed the selfish grievances of Columbus. He originally helped in the conquest of Cuba, but then realized that it was wrong. He wrote \"History of the Indies\", which provides much information for historians on what Columbus did. Here is a quote from book 2 of this series: \"[Columbus] was so anxious to please the king that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians\u2026\" Are these the words from someone of a period where genocide and slavery were morally acceptable? No. It was just that the Spaniards where greedy and acted immorally. After recording the horrible conditions of the dwindling Indians, who were reverting to suicide, and who were quickly being depopulated, he said thus: \"My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write\u2026\" Even if it was 500 years ago, there was still many basic ideas about human nature and morality that persist today. Things such as religion make sure of this. The ten commandments are very, very old. Las Casas wrote: \"Two of these so-called Christians met two Indian boys one day, each carrying a parrot; they took the parrots and for fun beheaded the boys.\" I hope these quotes from Las Casas served to illustrate the point that people with a sense of morality at the time did not approve of the actions of Columbus and the other Spaniards. And as far as you're assertion that Indians were not considered Human, the quotes have also contradicted this. You're only backing for that claim was that of \"according to Spanish Monarchy\". To this I reply: the biased views of those in power do not reflect upon the moral code of the era. \"Since my opponent is insinuating that Columbus day shouldn't be celebrated since christopher columbus held slaves, the [sic.] he is suggesting that noone [sic.] who has ever held a slave, or mistreated another culture should be celebrated.\" The words you have put in my mouth are an absolute statement, stating that \"noone\" of those specifications should be celebrated. I do not imply this, however. Columbus should not be celebrated because he had absolutely no virtuous attributes that are worthy of note. If he did, then it would be acceptable to celebrate him. Not only was he not a hero, though, but he was greedy and performed acts of genocide solely for self-gain. Once more, morality can only be measured by the intent of actions, and the intention of Columbus was evil, unlike so many great people in history who did great things and were good in nature, contributing greatly to humanity, but also had slaves. You have yet to provide any positive quality about the nature and personality of Columbus. The only thing you have provided is that he very distantly and inadvertently caused American independence to occur. <> I apologize that I have not provided the sources yet, but I would like to point out that holding them void would be unnecessary, because I made the only real citation that was necessary: Citing that it was the words of Christopher Columbus. However, for you're convenience I will tell you where I found the quotes. I got the quotes and subsequent information from \"A people's History of The United States\", by Howard Zinn. Alas, it is not an internet source, as you assumed, but a book. If you wish to use it for reference, you may find it at you local public library. If you wish to seek whether the quotes are \"made up\" or not, that is you're burden. I give you my word those are quotes from Columbus, and I have provided the way in which you may verify this.

It is disgusting that to this day we celebrate him annually with a national holiday in his very name: Columbus Day. We as a society should not honor this man. We need to acknowledge that he was not a hero but a greedy mass-murderer. The atrocity that I hint at is his genocide against the Arawak Indians. After encountering these Indians, he wrote thus in his log of them: \"They would make fine servants\u2026With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\" He also said this: \"As soon as I arrived in the Indies, in the first island which I found, I took by force some of the natives, in order that they might learn and might give me information of that which there is in these parts.\" From the very start he treated the peaceful Indians forcefully. He later sent many as slaves to Spain. In 1495, he sent 500 Arawak slaves back to Spain, 200 of which died on the voyage. He wrote: \"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold\" Christopher Columbus also forced all Arawaks 14 years or older to pay a certain amount of gold to them per month. If they failed to do this, they were killed. Many fled, and were hunted down and killed by Columbus and his men. Indians were worked endlessly in mines. With these terrors, mass suicides started being committed amongst the dwindling Indians. And point in case, in 2 years, half of the Indians on Haiti were dead. And so when we go back and look at history, we see that Christopher Columbus was a terrible human-being who should not be honored with his own national holiday. -Harlan", "qid": 44, "docid": "470ed1f-2019-04-18T19:34:46Z-00005-000", "score": 8.333900451660156}, {"content": "Title: Is an atheist celebrating Christmas hypocritical Content: \"You have seemed in your first statement to have accepted that it is hypocritical to celebrate religious holiday's as an atheist but that it is an acceptable hypocrisy, as if the populace are celebrating, this is in itself a reason to also celebrate as an individual.\", so it seems, but that is not the case. These traditions no longer belong to their affiliated roots no different than your neighborhood no longer belongs to any affiliated House or Charter. It is counterintuitive to push the idea that there is such a thing as ownership of traditions when society evolves beyond such simple concepts. Christmas isn't for Christians anymore, it's for everyone, even religiously Jewish people can and do celebrate Christmas (which would be a much, much larger hypocrisy) as just a national/globalized holiday. You could attempt to put exclusivity on every holiday based on it's history but this does not make celebration outside of that historical value hypocritical regardless of one's stances. \"The difference of course being if you label yourself as an atheist, rather than agnostic, undecided or even of a minority faith within the populace, you are actively of the belief in the REJECTION of a God/deity and therefore of any religion which concludes the existence of a God/deity. The act of rejection is to dismiss or refuse, so surely anything other than dismissal or refusal to participate within religious celebration is in itself hypocrisy. In relation to the other mentioned religiously based 'holidays' it is also hypocritical for an atheist to participate within their celebrations.\", it's technically hypocritical for anyone outside of a painstakingly small population to celebrate most days. This push towards segregation sounds unhealthy to be honest; being agnostic, undecided, Hindu, Jain, or even Islamic / Jewish all fail to acknowledge the specific deity of Christmas which has long since become so integrated into the world that it just doesn't matter. We even know that Jesus wasn't born on 12/25 (http://www.ucg.org...) but do the Christians rally for a proper change? No. Why not? Because it's not a matter of the day at all. Historical accuracy has all but eroded around the very concept; the entire proposition is a sham with even Christians hypocritically seeking to just keep the day that works best for them even though 12/25 falls around the time of the winter solstice, Christmas trees are pagan and The Church wasn't a fan (http://www.livescience.com...), and some Christians reject Christmas as a merging of pagan holidays (http://www.creationliberty.com...) and consumerism. The Christmas you're trying to purport exists ideologically simply doesn't and never did. There can be no hypocrisy revolving around it no different than a non-American in America isn't a hypocrite for celebrating July 4th with Americans and the same of any Independence Day around the world. \"St. Patricks day is misconstrued as a day to celebrate being 'irish' it is in fact a celebration of the catholic patron saint of Ireland st. Patrick, who is being celebrated for bringing Christianity/Catholicism to the people of Ireland.\", this is correct, but note something: It has evolved. It is not misconstrued, it is now what it is, and it's historical value is worthless. As far as the world is currently concerned it's weird broth and green beer day and that's it. \"St. Valentines day is slightly more ambiguous but still nether the less is a solely religiously based idea, st. Valentine was a Christian priest or bishop in the 3rd century who (although not absolute historical fact) was executed by roman Claudius II, for conducting marriages which had been outlawed, it is claimed that on the day of st. Valentines execution on February 14th that he sent a love letter to a lady signed 'from your valentine'. Valentines day is also related to an earlier pre Christian holiday Lupercalia, a celebration of a roman God.\", so in essence much like Christmas it has hypocritical pagan roots celebrating a man who broke the law repeatedly? While there's a lot more to this story using this blurb it would seem that this day is pretty much one giant Hypocritical mess since St. V. didn't really read the Bible since it specifically says in (ironically) Romans 13:1-5 \"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.\" or Luke 20:25 \"And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.\" both of which specifically refer to obedience and maintaining the law rather than going one's own way. To celebrate someone of such a standard is pretty much raising up an unholy holyman. \"As I made clear in my first argument, I am not suggesting that to prove ones atheistic beliefs they should deliberately offend the populace, but that to participate within or to benefit from the celebration itself is hypocritical to the beliefs and ideologies of atheism. Atheism ironically is classified as a religion, and to classify yourself as an atheist is making a 'statement'.\", and I am saying that your argument is ridiculous because the concept of cultural exclusivity just doesn't work. We could go through every celebrated event in any given country and find some plothole if you look hard enough but that's painfully frivolous since depending on where you are most traditions have such prevalence that they open up to others. Religiously speaking just as Jesus opened up to the Gentiles I would imagine the value of trying to keep the gates of Christmas, and therefore good will and excellent volunteering opportunities, closed would be no different than playing a member of the Sanhedren trying to protect something that simply isn't there and willing to go to any length to do so even if it means condemning yourself. \"So onto ownership of the holiday of Christmas, it can almost certainly in modern history be seen to be owned by Christianity, irrespective of wether or not it was the actual birth date of Jesus, it is what is being celebrated.\", which just makes zero sense. Christianity has evolved far beyond \"Jesus Day\" particularly because not all Christians or even Christianity in major portions, acknowledges it as a legitimate holiday. To declare that it's a done and done deal is to ignore the theological politics still surrounding the tradition; in the modern day and modern history it is nothing more than a culturally accepted holiday celebrated in a number of non-theocratic nations with the sheer purpose of spreading good cheer and increasing the GDP. The sacredness of a day can only be preserved with it's strictness; that's like saying \"July 4th is whatever even if historically it could have been March 2nd or something\" which is exactly what the paradox of Christmas is; some suggest it was almost 3 months prior to the day and that the day was suggested specifically to gather pagans under the cause which in turn makes it not only sacrilegious but hypocritical for Christians as expressed prior. \"Another argument atheists may have, is that prior to Christianity's influx into Europe an extremely similar holiday took place around the same time the 'winter solstice' and that Christianity adapted this holiday to fit in with the changing of beliefs of the new converts. This is true, it is extremely likely that Christianity took the winter solstice and changed the ideology into representing Christian values rather than pagan values. But this argument in itself makes no difference if you are indeed an atheist, because the winter solstice itself was a religious festival/holiday which was celebrating the belief in a God/deity by pagans, and would be contradictory to the belief in atheism.\", the winter solstice isn't a deistic event at all. Nor is the summer solstice. It's called Yalda (http://en.wikipedia.org...) and does not celebrate any god. You need to really brush up on how this works since these two events are actually cosmological referring to alignments of planets far more than any alignment to a deity. Much like buddhism there are philosophical and theological versions of Astrology. \"As I have previously stated there can be no rebuttal to the question, 'is an atheist celebrating Christmas hypocritical' it is fundamentally hypocritical, it is however a hypocrisy that is accepted amongst atheists, an argument of if you can't beat them join them ect does not make you any less hypocritical for doing so.\", at least you're confident, but to summarize in one sentence: Christmas ain't for Christians anymore.", "qid": 44, "docid": "2080394b-2019-04-18T15:35:04Z-00002-000", "score": 8.303000450134277}, {"content": "Title: Star Wars Day should be a national holiday.

The answer is that they never stop complaining. Whinge, whinge, whine, whine, moan, moan: they never get tired of carping on about how hard they're lives supposedly are. \"A woman's work is never done\" they grumble, but if that's true who are all those women's shows on daytime TV aimed at then? The advertisers wouldn't fund them if nobody was watching them. The fact is, these days, housewives have it even easier than ever what with modern appliances such as vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens, washer/dryers, dishwashers, food processors, they hardly have to lift a finger around the house. Furthermore, with the wide availability of ready-prepared meals and affordable clothing housewives no longer have to cook or sew. So, instead of doing something useful they lounge about all day watching TV or go out and spend their husbands' hard-earned cash on clothes, shoes and make-up. It wouldn't be so bad if husbands had nice sexy wives to come home to but most don\"t because the majority of women - 62% inAmerica- are overweight, just because they have so little physical work to do. No wonder strip clubs are booming these days. Now, to address my opponent's specific points in turn. \"Why should women get a holiday when others dont?\" This is positive discrimination gone mad. True, blacks get a public holiday in America, but women already have Mother's Day, and although it's not a public holiday, they still get cards, presents and breakfast in bed. That should be more than enough I would have thought. \"Why does it have to be called vagina day? why cant it be called women's day or something?\" \"Vagina Day\" sounds a bit clinical, don\"t you think? Why not something a little more poetic like Lady Garden Day, Hairy Clam Day, Gates of Heaven Day or Map of Tasmania Day? \"When would Vagina Day be?\" A week before Valentine\"s Day is just about the worst possible day: think about all the time, effort and expense men will be expected to go to in order to appease their womenfolk on Vagina Day only to have to waste even more time and money buying chocolates and flowers a week later. \"Why cancel work on that day?\" People would always welcome a free day off work and, therefore, might vote for my opponent\"s plan for that reason alone. My opponent might as well have proposed a \"Cowboys and Indians Day\" or \"Hamburger Day\" or \"Raccoon Day\" or \"Atom Bomb Day\" or \"NASA Day\" or \"College Shooting Day\" or \"Soda Pop Day\" or \"Tornado Alley Trailer Park Day\" or \"Hollywood Day\" or \"Wall Street Greed and Incompetence Day\" or anything else all-American. \"How is it celebrated?\" Giant balloon vaginas? My opponent hasn't thought this through. The last vagina I checked had a gash right down the middle of it and, clearly, this feature would not aid buoyancy in a balloon. And, while there have been some great women through the years but there have been some rotten ones too: let's remember Elizabeth Bathory, the Blood Countess, who tortured and killed hundreds of young girls so that she could bathe in the blood of virgins in order to keep her younger, or the 'Bitch of Buchenwald' who was the wife of Karl Koch, a Nazi concentration camp commandant, and who reveled in torture and obscenity, or the evil tyrant Margaret Thatcher who brought misery and despair to millions of decent, hard-working British people through her vile political campaigns against the working classes in the 1980\"s and 90\"s. These women all had vaginas and, as such, would be celebrated, but to do so would be an insult to the memories of their victims. Finally, fireworks would be wholly inappropriate: as a feminist studies graduate once expalained to me, fireworks are phallic symbols which rape the sky and pollute the air that women have to breathe.

The Columbian Exchange is the term used to describe the movement of native products from the old to the new world, and vice versa. The exchange introduced several new plants and food for each of the respective worlds. The exchange brought monumental changes in culture for Europe, Africa and America. The exchange brought tomatoes to Italy, rubber trees to Africa, potatoes to Ireland, coffee to Columbia, and cattle to Texas. Other products like chocolate draw their lineage back to the exchange, as well. Obviously, there was also the later discovery of gold in South America, which propelled the Spanish Empire into being one of the major European powers of its day. Other European empires, seeing the potential for such growth, swarmed on the Americas and the West Indies, providing significant economic stimulation. Columbus' discovery can also be credited with the birth of international mass capitalism. With such a huge supply of new products and economic opportunity, a primitive and mercantile form of capitalism became significant part of international trade. Such an example was triangle trade, in which goods moved from the Americas to Europe to Africa and eventually back to the Americas. The discovery Columbus made had an impact larger than just the Americas; it created an economic tsunami that shook the world (metaphorically speaking of course) 2) Columbus's discovery sparked interest in further North American exploration, and also led to the beginning of colonization in the Americas. The voyages of Columbus sparked other famed explorers to go to the New World. Conquistadors such as Cortes and Pizarro followed after Columbus and helped to establish a vast New World empire for Spain that stretched from the western portion of the United States all the way to the southern tip of Argentina. Other explorers followed suit, including key people such as Ponce de Leon, and John Cabot. Upon Columbus' discovery, there came a mad dash to establish large, and economically profitable empires. Also, the discovery brought about the avenue for other nations to occupy the free land, including England, which would eventually be the land which would be the foundation for the United States. This fact is sufficient to warrant the celebration of his voyage. His voyage set of a chain reaction that is key to the creation of the United States. 3) The negative actions by Columbus do not detract from the historic significance of his voyage. This is more of a talking point, but regardless, there is no reason that the crimes of Columbus take away from the world changing effect of his voyage. To say that the discovery of Columbus was any less important because of the fact that he engaged in the slave trade and was a brute to the natives is unreasonable. It does make Columbus himself seem less reputable as a man, but his voyage is nonetheless monumental. There is a clear connection between the discovery of the continents', the establishment of European colonies, and the founding of America. This fact warrants the United States observing the world changing voyage, considering that it was such a pivotal moment in America's history. It is also logical to name the holiday after the man who actually discovered in the first place. 4) The day celebrates the discovery, not the man. Columbus Day celebrates the voyage of Columbus, not what he did. Now, I cannot refute the fact that as a conqueror, Columbus was guilty of several inhumane actions. However, as I have said, the voyage is the key and it is still important. Simply googling the definition of Columbus Day will prove my point (the bottom 4 sources are the first few results of doing this) and they all echo the same concept: The day celebrates the anniversary of Columbus' voyage, not Columbus' character. Its is not the same as how some states recognize Lincoln's birthday. In this case, the man as a whole is being recognized. Columbus day is meant to recognize the voyage. It only bears his name, since he was the one to discover it (and saying The Day an Italian Man Set Foot on Cuba Day isn't as compact) Christopher Columbus' voyage was a key moment in the process of our nation's beginnings, and the magnitude of the voyage is very much worthy of a federal holiday. His voyage changed the world, and in doing so paved the way for European empires to colonize the Americas, which would lead to the founding of the United States. While Columbus was a terrible governor and an inhumane brute, his discovery was unquestionably important. To ed this holiday would be removing a holiday which represents a very significant step in the history of the United States, for no legitimate reason, as I proved above, and as I intend to prove in the following rounds.

My opponent has not bothered to argue this point, and so I assume he recognizes it as true.\u201d Rebuttal: Naturally. The debate is not concerned with if Christmas has federal recognition. I already stated that the Holiday received federal recognition in 1870. My opponent\u2019s burden is to show why this recognition is unfair, unconstitutional or otherwise undesirable. This is an empty objection. --------------------- Pro stated: \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough, though, the government showing such a marked preference for Christianity and making all federal employees take a day of out of respect to a religion they may not follow.\u201d Rebuttal: Again, my opponent failed to argue how a \u201cmandatory\u201d paid holiday is unfavorable. Stating that the employee is \u201cforced\u201d to observe the day would insinuate that the employee is forced to pray, worship or otherwise partake in the ritual. Instead, the employee is given a fully compensated period of leave which can be spent in manner desirable to the employee. My opponent has failed to show a victim group. --------------------- Pro remarked: I suppose they (the Federal Government) keep the essential services running. I don\u2019t really see how that affects the argument, though. Rebuttal: The argument is affected by the mere fact that federal observance is a luxury, not a duty. A vast congress of uniformed service members are forced to forego observance in lieu of mandatory hazardous duty in foreign, hostile conditions. This premise nullifies the entire concept of \u201cforced\u201d observance. With many Federal agencies, we actually see forced non-observance. As the Air Force core value states:\u201d Service before self.\u201d Pro flagrantly dropped this argument. --------------------- Pro remarked: You astonish me. I would never have thought you would put a citizen\u2019s feelings before his rights. Or that you would say freedom is about being positive. Rebuttal: My opponent clearly missed the premise. As I stated in round 2, the federal recognition of Christmas passed in 1870 by full recognition of both Houses. The representatives of the American Public introduced the bill and so it\u2019s only logical that an equal measure is required to repeal the bill. By ignoring public opinion my opponent has conceded an incredible pillar to his premise, which is the Law that recognized Christmas to begin with. This is the second point my opponent has flagrantly dropped. --------------------- Pro wasted an incredible amount of space answering questions that weren\u2019t asked. These, above any other arguments, are the most ridiculous arguments my opponent has furnished. It\u2019s not a difficult task to debate someone when you grant yourself the luxury of putting words in their mouth. Highly condescending. Rebuttal: The purpose of the revenue snapshot was to illuminate the vast importance that Christmas has to our economy. By granting Federal employees a paid winter vacation, it encourages the employee to participate in the holiday economy. In essence, the paid holiday leave is most certainly being filtered back into the economy, stimulating the incredible revenue growth experienced only during this season. The incredible profits enjoyed by the Federal Government also indicate that public support for the festivity is pervasive, making an appeal to authority or an appeal to ethics irrelevant. As I\u2019ve stated before, my opponent has failed to establish a victim group. It would have been a good start for him to show another religion campaigning for federal recognition. Perhaps he could have cited a secular appeal to the courts to remove the Holiday. Alas, my opponent made no such arguments at all. --------------------- Pro stated: So many wonderful cultural and religious festivals that thrive without government interference! Why can\u2019t Christmas be like that too? Rebuttal: Laws don\u2019t change because you really, really want them to. Christmas probably \u201ccould\u201d be like that too, but you must show why it should be like that too. --------------------- Pro said: Yes, the vast majority of Americans find no religious significance in Christmas Day. It makes sense, then, to replace Christmas with a secular holiday. Such as winter solstice. Rebuttal: Amazing objection. Perhaps my opponent doesn\u2019t realize that Winter Solstice is Pagan and not a secular observance? It dates back to the Norse empire and Rome. [1] Additionally, as I\u2019ve already stated, Christmas observance is relative. Christians observe it religiously, the secularist observes it culturally. My opponent has not only dropped this point, he has also failed to show that Federal observance is religious in nature. This is the third premise dropped by my opponent. ------------------ Pro cited the following source: \u201cChristmas is a Christian holiday marking the birth of the Christ Child. Decorating houses and yards with lights, putting up Christmas trees, giving gifts, and sending greeting cards have become holiday traditions even for many non-Christian Americans.\u201d http://www.usa.gov...... Rebuttal: That is a definition from a public relations website, it\u2019s not a law. Additionally, the source directly concedes that Christmas observance is not necessarily Christian. If my opponent would like to see what a legal guideline is, let me cite the ruling of Ganulin vs. The United States (1999). As per the judge: \u201cCourts have repeatedly recognized that the Christmas holiday has become largely secularized. ...By giving federal employees a paid vacation day on Christmas, the government is doing no more than recognizing the cultural significance of the holiday.\u201d [2] Argument extended. ------------------ Conclusion: Pro built a weak and careless resolution in his first round. Without rhyme or reason, he stated simply that the Government shall observe \u201cNO public holiday,\u201d provide \u201cno public funds for Christmas trees,\u201d and grant \u201cno official acknowledgement of the day.\u201d As we can see from the debate, Pro immediately dropped the first two burdens. This is most likely because he realized too late that Federal Observances are not public. As I stated (and my opponent dropped this argument also), there is a difference between a national holiday and a federal holiday. Instead, my opponent focused on the third portion of his burden ONLY. Remarkably, he never established a single argument for his burden. Rather, he spent the entirety of his debate trying to defend against my attacks on his burden. My opponent has clearly failed to satisfy the burden he laid out in round one. Furthermore, he has failed to adequately defend against my attacks. This debate was very on-sided but I would like to thank my opponent regardless. I found the topic worthwhile and this debate helped me establish an educated opinion on the issue. I\u2019d like to thank the voter for reading the arguments and (without any pun intended) I\u2019d like to wish everyone a peaceful and joyful holiday season. Vote Con. http://www.bbc.co.uk...

Just for the record, I am a practicing Armenian Orthodox Christian (a member of the Oriental Orthodox branch), and my church officially celebrates Christmas on January 6th. Personally, I do celebrate Christmas on December 25th. Lastly, I am U.S.-based. I believe you are UK-based, so for this round, I may make factually incorrect statements about your country. Please feel free to correct me. In addition, I will be working from these assumptions: a. Christmas has two facets; a religious celebration, celebrating the birth of Christ, and a secular celebration, celebrating nothing in particular, but often resulting in family togetherness, the exchange of gifts, certain traditions (decorating houses with lights, putting up a Christmas tree, singing traditional songs, etc.), and general goodwill and high spirits. b. You propose that the secular holiday separate from the religious holiday, with the secular holiday turning into the festival of Yule. c. You propose that the religious holiday would be moved back to its original date, and believers would follow traditions that are solely Christian in nature. d. You believe Christians should not celebrate non-Christian festivals, as they are \"not for them.\" e. Your argument for (d.) is justified because Christians \"have their own festivals which non-adherents of their faiths are not welcome to participate in.\" I posit that it is first of all, unnecessary to move Christmas back to its original date. Much of what is actually practiced and believed by all Christians is not written in the Bible. There is a huge amount of dogmatic nuances, from the Church calendar, to the vestments the priests wear, that are carried on solely through Church traditions. The date Christmas is celebrated on for Catholics, Protestants, and Eastern Orthodox Churches is one of those traditions. There is no legitimate reason, other than to piss off Christians, to change the Church traditions. Religious festivals are allowed to fall on the same day. Every few years, one of the nights of Hanukkah will fall on the 25th. Every once in a while, Passover will fall on Easter. There's no issue. Which brings me to my next point; The exclusion of Christians from Yuletide festivities. In America, and I can only assume it is the same way in the UK, a secularized society combined with a doctrine to spread the faith has resulted in Christians practically begging people of other faiths to come to their Church and celebrate the liturgy with them. It is like this for many religious events and festivals, for multiple religions. A Jewish child will invite their friends to their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. The (mostly Christian) group of children will sit patiently in the Temple as the child reads from the Torah in a language none of them understand. Weddings, holy events, one of the seven sacraments in Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and of great religious importance in most other religions, are attended by people of all faiths. Baptisms are usually limited to close friends and family, but if an atheist friend wanted to come, no one would deny him. Jews often open up their homes to Jews and Gentiles alike for Seders. Finally, of course, there's Christmas. It's the second most holy day of the year, and it's celebrated by most of the secular world. But I'll allow that the Christmas celebrated by the general populace is the secular holiday, not the religious one. You would have Yule be exclusive though? To whom? Adherents to the Pagan faiths who originally celebrated it? There is still considerable debate over what the religious meaning of Yule actually is. And in your argument, you stated that everybody but Christians should celebrate Yule, including devoted Jews, Muslims, and Hindus. Why the arbitrary line? Because you don't like Christians? If you truly want to separate the secular holiday from the religious holiday, you cannot exclude a religion. It's similar to saying that Christians must work on Labor Day (or any random day you get off of work over there). Next, you believe that Christians should revert to traditional Christian traditions, while Yule retains the trappings of Yule. Again, you're saying that Christians are not allowed to appropriate other culture's traditions, as they did not develop them, and they mean nothing to them. What does Yule mean to you? What will it mean to every non-Christian across the world who celebrates it? Surely not what it meant to the Germanic tribes who celebrated it before Christianity came. If Christians must stick to their own traditions, there's no reason why you must not as well. That means no using the name \"Yule\" and none of the traditions you mentioned above, just some pure, secular, new ones. Finally, and perhaps most distressing to me, was the food Christians would be forced to eat. Just traditional, bland sounding food? Awful! Except whose tradition is that food? Was it traditional because the food has special meaning, or mainly out of necessity? Those all look like foods that may have been eaten by British Christians, but what about Christians in Italy? Would they have to give up the Feast of the Seven Fishes, their traditional Christmas Eve meal? I would say not. Armenia was the first Christian nation, converted in 301 AD, and traditional Christmas dinner involves none of those things. Rather, a Mediterranean spread is prepared, mixing in Turkish, Greek, and Middle Eastern cuisine. I don't see why I would have to give that up because Englishmen didn't know how to cook in ancient times. So the next time some pious Christian tries to chastise you for not going to church on December 25th, tell them that, even though that's the official day Christmas is celebrated in their religion, you can take responsibility for you own soul, but thank them for the concern. Again, for the record, I'm a very liberal Oriental Orthodox Christian, who does celebrate the religious holiday on December 6th, the secular holiday on December 25th, and I go to Church every Christmas eve for Christmas carol singing. The Church may not officially believe it's Christmas eve, but it's still a very nice thing they do.", "qid": 44, "docid": "f84a076a-2019-04-18T17:58:04Z-00001-000", "score": 8.052000045776367}, {"content": "Title: Autumn Is The Best Season Content: \"Everything is subjective in this debate. My opponent's opinion is that autumn is the best season, and mine is that it isn't.\" First, I'd like to point out that this debate was meant to be subjective. The point of me opening such an argument was to see just how convincing one could be in a debate of such. I think with the topic at hand my opponent has defended his stance very well. \"They mostly migrate south and come back for the summer, indicating their preference not to freeze during the Milwaukee Autumns.\" Well, these hobos that you know in Milwaukee may migrate because in NY the average temperature during Fall is 65 degrees in the day and 50 degrees at night. Both of those temperatures are rather adequate if you live up north. So, yes I do believe it depends on your location where one would stand on this debate. \"I suppose its subjective then.\" Yes, it is highly subjective whether people enjoy the holidays or not especially during the Fall. However, a large portion of people enjoy celebrating them. \"This is a political event involving Jews, incidentally taking place on or around Yom Kipper.\" This video is not a political movement. If it was, there wouldn't be only Jews on Wall Street. Jewish people came on their holiday to bring joy and happiness and their support to those on Wall Street by bringing Yom Kippur to them. That is why they are all singing and dancing in their language. \"The holiday is however considered the holiest of the Jewish year, and in this sense brings meaning to those who recognize the spiritual importance. Whether this is internalized as joy or not, is obviously subjective. But I'm confident most Jews are happy it only comes but once a year.\" Being that Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year for Jews, it should be a very special day whether or not there's a huge celebration. It is of high significance which makes it an important time during the Fall for Jews. \"Breast cancer is a serious issue and it's great that October is a national month for awareness of it.\" In September, we have Suicide Prevention Week. November is American Diabetes Month as well as National Alzheimer's Disease Month. December simply is the month of Christmas which all look forward to each and every year. http://www.pcihealth.edu...

The summer brings financial burdens on many families for they have to find babysitters, daycares or day camps to bring their children so that they may have a more productive summer and they can work. It gets very expensive though. Also, many parents have to spend lots of money to keep the AC running because of the blazing hot days and sticky, humid nights. They have to buy their kids and themselves new wardrobe for the new season because their spring clothes are too heavy. Also, there are increased crime rates during the summer time compared to during the spring time because of the increased amount of idle time given to young adults. Also, young adults are getting pregnant in the summertime much more often because of their rushing hormones and it is the season for many teenagers to become much more sexually active due to all of their free time and lack of parental supervision during the day. It's a season which teenagers call \"summer love.\"", "qid": 44, "docid": "70011e98-2019-04-18T18:24:43Z-00001-000", "score": 8.038800239562988}, {"content": "Title: Discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs should be legal in the workplace Content: For example, British Airways' rules used to state that employees' \"jewellery must be worn out of sight, beneath a uniform\" but now certain members of staff are allowed to wear jewellery openly.

Your boss might like to ask you not to wear it for fear of upsetting Democrat customers but he couldn't because it symbolises your faith and you are, therefore, protected by law.

Mondays to Fridays and 9.30 a. m. to 12.30 p. m. on Saturdays. Imagine you are a political activist and your committee meetings are held on Saturday mornings and you explain to the bank manager that you are unable to work on Saturday mornings for that reason but he replies that the hours of work apply to all tellers and that they form part of the contract of employment. What are you going to do? Either give up your political activities or turn down the job, right? Not so if Saturday happens to be the Sabbath in your chosen religion though. You can turn round to your future boss and tell him that you will take the job but he cannot enforce the terms of the contract of employment upon you and make you work Saturdays because contract law is subordinate to national legislation and that if he attempts to either refuse to employ you or penalise you for not working Saturdays you will drag him and the bank through the courts. Now that's not just or equitable, is it? In response to my opponent's final point: \"Discrimination is not disallowing holidays it is allowing people to insult people of separate religions due to their religious beliefs. \" Holidays are not the real issue here as, while an employer is obliged to grant a religious employee special days off work in respect of their faith, they normally come out of their annual leave entitlement, which is a fairly reasonable comprimise. However, when it comes to slurs, employees are insulted at work for all sorts of reasons - it could be due to their appearance, their personal habits, their political ideals or their religious beliefs. In most cases these matters are dealt with by the way of internal disciplinary procedures but in the case of religious insults the Company can be held vicariously liable for their employees' ill-considered remarks in a court of law and suffer substantial financial losses as a consequence. In the final analysis, someone's life-long, deeply-held political beliefs cannot, and should not, be considered legally less valid than another person's religious beliefs and employers and non-religious co-workers should not be penalised as a result of this legislative assumption.

University of Miami students and State University of NY at Binghamton students get over a month off for winter break... [1] [2] By allowing winter break to exist, universities are shortening academic semesters, thereby taking away from the depth and amount of content of students' courses. This, in the end, adversely affects students, whose education is being sacrificed. Also, this especially hurts many nonreligious students who do not celebrate Christmas or Hannukah. The only reason why we have these specific holidays off is because we are in a Judeo-Christian area in the world. Because of this, we completely disregard the religious values of the Islamic community; most institutions of learning in North America do not have school breaks for Ramadan. Also, we completely ignore the religious beliefs of very small minorities; for example, there are no schools in North America for those of the Voodoo faith, who celebrate the Day of the Dead (Nov. 1-2.) [3] The only holiday that there should perhaps be a several day-long break for is New Years, since it is very secular and universal. Classes should continue on religious holidays; teachers/professors on religious leave should not be paid during their absence and should be subsituted by other instructors, and students who are absent should be expected to make up classwork. 2) Mental exhaustion? US students aren't worked even close to as hard as those in many other countries. Through more rigorous and challenging school curricula, other countries are teaching their student more effectively and are thereby defeating the United States in international education rankings. When 34 countries were considered, the US \"ranked 14th in reading, 17th in science, and 25th in math.\" [4] Since the instatement of No Child Left Behind, states have been reducing the difficulty of their respective state examinations and emphasizing a curriculum that is arguably more lax than any in the United State's history; states (e.g., Missouri) inflate grades by lowering standards. [5] How do we fix this trend and get our nation back on top? We can get rid of winter break so that school curricula could be extended and more material could be fit into them so that students are able to acquire more knowledge, which would certainly boost our position in the rankings and keep our country ahead when it comes to technology and scientific advancement, as it had been in relatively recent history. 3) Proper funding of schools is a separate issue. Money should not get in the way of providing an adequate education of students, and policies should be revised in order to change that. A lack of money is not an acceptable justification for depriving students of an education Moreover, education spending from the government should increase in order to fund schools, especially during times like these, when our education system is sinking in international rankings, as stated in the prior argument.4) Most students are not autodidacts and need a proper teaching environment in order to efficiently acquire knowledge. Students learn by themselves year-round; they learn how to do the laundry, how to comb their hair, how to read by themselves... But if acquiring academic information were so easy, students would not have to go to school and just stay home all year teaching themselves all of the coursework. Students would benefit far, far more if they were to continue attending school and being properly instructed over winter break than if they stayed home and built clay models of Egypt. Winter break should not exist.

You have provided no reason for why April Fool's day would be an atheist holiday beside your one reference to Scripture. You must establish why that Scripture should determine when an atheist has a holiday. I could provide you with a citation from Dawkins or Hitchins that says \"Christians are fools.\" Would that make April Fool's Day a Christian holiday? You say \"Christians could not take Groundhog's Day as a holiday because it has no connections to Jesus Christ.\" I the same way, atheists could not take April 1st as a holiday because it has no connection to atheism. Indeed the fact that you link atheism to the date through scriptures is a striking reason why April 1st would NOT be an atheist holiday. Atheist would try to distance themselves from the connection as much as possible. Once again, why would atheists be linked to a date through Christian Scripture? That makes as much sense as setting a Buddhist day of celebration based on the Koran. I have no idea what the Gregorian calendar has to do with April 1st being an atheist holiday. A digression: atheists follow the calendar because it is historical contingency that happens to be used in our society. Some new points: You may be right that atheists are fools, but that does not make April 1st the atheistic holiday. Your conclusion is essentially drawn from the following premises: April 1st is the holiday of fools. Atheists are fools (so sayeth scripture) April 1st is the holiday of atheists. However, a large number of groups are fools (nazi's, flat earth-ists, clowns, people who gamble large quantities of money). So April 1st is their holiday also. This shows that the holiday is not a day designed for atheists \"to celebrate their non-faith.\" The holiday is not exclusively for atheists. Furthermore, as you state the atheist holiday is \"to celebrate their non-faith.\" Yet April 1st has nothing to do with a celebration of non-faith. It is already steeped in traditions of practical jokes that have nothing to do with atheism (please do not try and make some witty jab at atheism in response). In fact, your own argument shows that the link between April 1st and atheists is not \"a [celebration] of non-faith,\" but their apparent foolishness. Finally, what is a holiday? Merriam Webster: \"Holiday\" 1: holy day 2: a day on which one is exempt from work; specifically : a day marked by a general suspension of work in commemoration of an event 3:chiefly British : vacation \u2014often used in the phrase on holiday \u2014often used in plural 4: a period of exemption or relief Clearly an atheist could not have 1, a holy day, and April 1st isn't one anyways. April 1st does not meet the criteria of a holiday under 2, because there is still school and work on April 1st. 3 also does not apply because April 1st is not a vacation. Finally, atheists do not receive a period of exemption or relief on April 1st, so it is not a April 1st is not a holiday PERIOD, much less an atheist holiday.", "qid": 44, "docid": "ec580f43-2019-04-18T19:58:39Z-00002-000", "score": 7.9222002029418945}, {"content": "Title: \"We should change the date of Australia Day, as it doesn't truly celebrate all Australians\" Content: On Australia Day we come together as a nation to celebrate what's great about Australia and being Australian.

Also, my opponent describes that the court case of Newdow v. Rio came to the stating that the words were of \"ceremonial and patriotic nature\" and did not constitute an establishment of religion. But, one could also see that just because a item or written work is in ceremonial and patriotic nature, does not mean that it is non-religious in nature. For example, in England, their patriotic songs are in religious root, with lyrics of, \"And guardian Angels sung this strain\" and \"God save the Queen! \"[3]. This notation is no different than our own with the national anthem, a patriotic song, \". .. Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land\" and, \"Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto:In God is our trust;\"[4]. My opponent argues that Americans are not required to celebrate the religious ceremonies. On federal holidays, the government closes down \"Non-essential federal government offices. \"[5] Truly, if the government was separated by Church and State, we as a nation would not set aside a day for a holiday that is defined as,\"A worldwide holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. \" Jesus Christ is a figure of Christianity, and this national holiday is under this name, along with having a national Christmas tree in front of the white house, lit by the president. Finally, my opponent states that I made a mistake on where our currency is printed. He states,\"Currency in the United States of America is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which acts under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Department of the Treasury. \" My opponent fails to recognize that the Department of Treasury is headed by a man named Timothy F. Geithner. This man also makes up President Obama's current cabinet.

I would also like to ask my opponent another question. Has there ever been a president without religious beliefs, claimed either in their campaigns or said by them directly? My opponent fails to recognize the many signs of in which the government has traces of any religion in this country, which are ingrained in American government. ------------------------- [1]. http://www.merriam-webster.com...

Likewise in arguments a negative times a negative equals a positive, and negative times a positive is negative. The resolution is a negative statement and I have the positive side; therefore I have a negative burden of proof. You have the negative side so you have Positive burden of proof. therefore it is not my duty to convey why you should not celebrate a holiday until you provide sufficient justification for celebrating. That should win the argument for me in this debate, but lets hypothetically say I don't really think that and believe the voters will not either, then I will go ahead provide more reasons for why you should not. Your refutation about my point of earning more money was your retired. But you see the flaw with that argument is that you should not be retired either. this state of existence is an illogical one to enter into in the first place. the ultimate goal for anyone, God or no God, before they die is to leave the world a better place than when we left it. To contribute to society. As long as there is breath in our bodies this is still something we can do. But often we can never truly measure the good one has done until some time after they have died and there has been enough time to start seeing the chain affects directly resulting from the actions of their life. So in our own live there will never be a day we can say with certainty \"I have left the world a better place than it would have been had I not been born, so I can quit contributing and retire now\" Plus the resolution deals with all atheist, not just you, and we can not assume that all atheist are crippled to a degree that they can not help anymore so retirement is a state of existence they must enter. So its logical to benefit society for as long as possible and never retire, and it is logical to make more money, so one should not celebrate a holiday. Another point worth making, if being a hypocrite honestly is concerning enough to us that avoiding being such warrants stating we should not do certain things, then by your definitions this qualifies well enough as being hypocritical. Because to celebrate Christmas as you defined would bring you to church on Christmas morning reading scriptures about the birth of Christ and how he was a gift of god. You, an atheist, who does not believe their even is a god... well the action would contradict your stated belief. Celebrating L Ron Hubbard's birthday as you defined it would involve passing out copies of his book \"The Way To Happiness\". You, an atheist, who does not believe in any Gods, would be doing something contradictory if you celebrated the life of a man who not only thought that there were gods,but that you could become one. (I am aware that they don't use the 'term' god, but that is what a thetan is). For an atheist the resurrection of the dead is not possible, So it contradicts to celebrate on Easter the rising from the dead of an individual 2,000 years ago. Unless you believe in sin, then Christ sacrifice does not mean anything, so that would contradict in your action to celebrate it. But as I said all this would only be pertinent if being a hypocrite is a relevant factor to whether one 'should' or 'should not' do something. I am not sure I could prove that it is. But they are other reasons I can argue not related to money or being a hypocrite that show you should not celebrate the holiday's. Because it is outright detrimental to the quality of your life to do. One might read that and go 'are you crazy, holidays are fun, an important factor to improving the quality of ones life' One might also not ever go into such deep thought on their own witch is why I pose the question for you. But bear with me and I shall explain. Whether you believe their is a god or their is not, All generally agree that we should live our lives,that our life is ours and we should rise up and live it! the expression 'difference in breathing and being alive' or 'standing outside the fire' is rooted in this philosophy. Everyone would want to 'be alive' (not a reference to your mortality) as being so is described in Tim McGraw's song 'live like you were dying'. I contend that Holiday celebration is a disease to your ability to live like you were dying. The hype surrounding enjoyment of a single day causes a lull into the quality of every other day of the year. You merely 'get by' day to day waiting like a drone for the next holiday to come. I ask you why would anyone logically choose to make Christmas the day for giving gifts and helping the poor? the Native Americans gave presents to each other in potlucks long before the people who brought the celebration of Christmas with them to America. why show special affection to your wife on Valentines day when she deserves it everyday from you? If you recognize the day specifically enough to show romance on it you are accepting in some degree that all other days of the year are not for showing that much affection to her. If you do give her your love on all other day's of the year then there is nothing during Valentines day to even recognize, because it is the same as any other day. All of this is especially important for you Con, because if we ignore the reasons I gave for not retiring and simply look at the purpose and goal behind doing so, you retire so you can spend all your time doing things that are fun. If you live your life in a way that you can not be said to have 'lived like you were dying' then the whole purpose of your retirement is a failure, so it can be argued that it is vital that you avoid holidays that can be a poison to your doing so, so I am arguing it. Maybe it is possible to celebrate holidays without lowering the quality of your life every other day of the year waiting for them to pass by. But if there is the danger's are far to high. So this I find is my best argument to fit my opponents criteria for persuading why he 'should not' observe a religious holiday, because it not enough to warrant explicit forbidding statements in my conclusion, but enough to advise against. So to wrap up: 1) Con had the positive burden to justify celebrating any holiday in the first place. 2) retirement is not a logical reason to pass up overtime, because retirement is not logical in the first place 3) Observing (as Con defined) the holiday's (as Con defined) honestly is contradictory in action with the professed belief. So if being a hypocrite is concerning to you, vote Pro. 4) Every man dies, but not everyman lives. don't waste your life waiting for holiday's make every day special, and in effect make nothing special about the holidays. For any of the above 4 reasons I urge the voters to vote Pro on arguments Because My opponent has sourced to define stuff and not directly back up an argument, nearly ignoring the definitions as was, vote Pro on sources. As for spelling and grammar, vote Con, I understand why Conduct, vote tie, I have enjoyed this debate and do not see any uncordial act on either side.

Content: My opponent opened the debate by mentioning the Pledge of Allegiance and emphasizing the words \"one nation under God\" and arguing that through the addition of the the words \"under God\", the Government, or more correctly Congress, \"did indeed put forth an action with religion in it\". This argument is false. As an atheist myself I consider the addition of the words \"under God\" superfluous and asinine, however there is a great difference between using the generic word \"God\" and claiming this represent an infiltration of religion in matters of the State, and this for several reasons: 1) Even though widely used, The Pledge of Allegiance is not a law nor its use mandatory either in public schools nor as a part of any state function. In the court case Frazier v. Alexandre of May 31st, 2006, \"A federal district court in Florida has ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution\" [1] 2) The Pledge of Allegiance does not use the name of a deity that can be related with a religion, even though those names, such as Yahweh for Judaism, Jehovah for Christianity, Allah for Islam, Buddha for Buddhism, are widely known, used and recognized. Therefore the use of the word \"under God\" does not constitute an implementation or endorsement of a particular religion or religion in general by the Government of The United States of America. On March 11, 2010, In the court case of Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District of March 11th, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the words \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case, ruling that the words were of a \"ceremonial and patriotic nature\" and did not constitute an establishment of religion. [2] My opponent continues his argumentation by citing the national motto of The United States of America: \"In God we trust\". My opponent mistakenly asserts that our currency is printed by the \"Federal Reserve Banks, which is a government institution\". Both these assertions are false. Currency in the United States of America is printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which acts under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. [3] Furthermore, the Federal Reserve system is not a governmental institution, but an \"independent entity within the government\" and \"its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.\" [4] The core of the argument though is that through the use of the words \"In God we trust\", the US government has allowed religion to be part of State matters. This is absolutely not the case. According to the Wordbook Dictionary, a Motto is a \"favorite saying\". Having an official favorite saying, or a motto, which includes the words \"In God we trust\" does not establish a connection between religion, or church, and the state, even if the root of the motto is found in the Bible itself, because the national Motto itself, even though established by law, is not a law of the United States of America and does not bind any public official or private citizen to it in any legal way. My opponents final argument is that national holidays that have their roots in religion, such as Christmas, constitute a violation of the separation of church and state. This argument, as well as the first two, fails to recognize that even though federal holidays are set by law, the celebration of religious ceremonies is not. No person in the United States is required to celebrate Christmas. Furthermore, while the holiday known today to us as Christmas has been traditionally been associated with Christianity and the birth of Jesus, it is rooted in Germanic traditions and the celebration of the winter solstice. [5] Having Christmas Day as a federal holiday does not mean that the Government of the United States endorses the religious celebration of Christians on Christmas Day nor the endorsement or establishment of Christianity or any other religion as State religion in the United States. My opponent ends his first round asking two questions: 1. Why do national holidays have religious roots? 2. Why is god stated in many official documents? My answers two those questions are: 1) Some national holidays, such as Christmas, have their roots in religion because religion is part of our national culture. 2) The words \"In God we trust\" and \"One nation under God\" have are found in official documents because their use is seen as a tradition, and they don't have any legislative consequence whatsoever, nor do they represent a governmental establishment or prohibition of religion. The separation of Church and State in the United States is enshrined in the United States Constitution, which is the Supreme Law of the United States. The First Amendment clearly states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\". No US citizen can be required or prohibited to exercise his religious belief or lack thereof, no public official can be subjected to a religious test, and no legislature or executive branch or the US Government or of any State of the Union can pass a law or executive order that violates the First Amendment to the US Constitution. No single point that my opponent has formulated represents a violation of the separation of church, or religion, and state, and his assertion that there is no separation of Church and State in the United States is blatantly false.

Starting from the beginning, it seems necessary to point out that I was befuddled by my opponents use of the word \"should\" in the title of the debate. As Dictionary. com defines: Should: Must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that. My initial suspicion was that my opponent actually believed that homework should be prohibited on Halloween. That is, he does not merely believe that it would be nice if there were no homework on Halloween, but rather that homework should be legislatively barred from assignment on Halloween. My suspicion was confirmed when I read this in my opponents opening argument: \"I believe that on Halloween teachers should not be allowed to give their students homework\u2026\" My opponent then creates a false dichotomy between secular and religious holidays. He makes the assumption that students are excused from homework on religious holidays but not secular. Balderdash. Points and questions that need to be addressed by my opponent: 1. Is it true that Teachers are not allowed to assign homework on religious holidays? If so, A. Where is the scholastic policy that mandates teachers to not assign homework on religious holidays? B. What religious holidays are stipulated? If this is not so, A. Why do you find it necessary to prohibit homework on Halloween if it is not prohibited on any other holiday? Secular or otherwise. B. Why try to limit the scholastic endeavors of a teacher by mandating a homework assignment bar? In all my Middle School and High School years, I never remember having no homework on Ash Wednesday, or Good Friday. I typically even had homework over winter break. Easter is always on Sunday, and I can even recall doing homework on some fine Easter days (when Easter did not occur during Spring Break of course). The idea that special benefits are extended to religious holidays is simply not true. Special benefits, if any, are typically extended to federally recognized holidays - a recognition which does not extend to Halloween. Among the eleven federally recognized holidays, only one of them is explicitly religious, and that is Christmas day. My argument for why homework should not be barred on Halloween day: 1. It extends special benefits to a celebration that is not federally recognized - benefits that are not extended to ANY of the actual federally recognized holidays. 2. It offsets the scholastic endeavors of teachers, keeping them from requiring what may be beneficial for student learning. 3. Teachers should not be limited in the assignment of homework. While it may be nice to not have homework on Halloween, a mandatory bar is both absurd and detrimental.

I'll respond to Con in the order of argument he's presented... 1. First, Con says that I have not stated why saying \"Merry Christmas\" is better than saying \"Happy Holidays.\" I have actually refuted this in 2 ways, and explained explicitly how in the last round. First, I said that my burden isn't necessarily to prove that saying \"Merry Christmas\" is better but simply that it is equally appropriate. Second, even if for some reason you would assume that my burden is to prove that saying \"Happy Holidays\" is BETTER, I have already explicitly stated in the last round that, \"saying 'Merry Christmas' shouldn't be considered taboo or politically incorrect simply because people have a right to say it, it's not offensive, and it is more of a personal and genuine greeting to those who believe in Christmas.\" Therefore Con is incorrect in saying that I have not fulfilled a burden or ignored something in particular. 2. Con says that \"Merry Christmas\" refers to a specific day and therefore it is not as acceptable to say. However, people start saying \"Happy Holidays\" from late November to early January, generally through New Years Day [1] though Christmas is only on one of those days, and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa only last for 7-8 days out of that 28 day period. In other words, there is no actual holiday going on during the times when people say \"Happy Holidays\" for 3/4 of the time. Therefore it is implied that \"Happy Holidays\" is a general greeting just as \"Merry Christmas\" is a general greeting and they generally mean the same thing. Neither greeting actually implies that there is an actual holiday going on during that day. If that were true, then people wouldn't say \"Happy holidays\" long after something like Hanukkah has ended. Even more proof is the fact that Kwanzaa in particular begins AFTER Christmas on December 26 [2], which is usually when people stop saying \"Happy Holidays.\" The point here is that when people say \"Merry Christmas\" they say it long before the actual Christmas day therefore you can't say that \"Merry Christmas\" only acknowledges one day and \"Happy holidays\" acknowledges more than one day. The fact is that those phrases both, in general, mean the same thing and there is no actual way to know if someone is celebrating something, therefore the phrase is generally a representation of what the individual celebrates. If one chooses to take offense, that is their preoperative; however, it is just as offensive to assume that one celebrates any holiday to begin with. 3. Con acknowledges that there are more religions aside from atheism, which proves absolutely nothing. I've already acknowledged this and actually listed a bunch of the world's most popular religions in order, so...? My point was that saying \"Happy holidays\" assumes one is either Christian, Jewish or celebrates the African culture - which is no different or better than assuming someone celebrates just Christianity. 4. Con says that \"Merry Christmas\" excludes Judaism and Kwanzaa. That's entirely true - and so what? It's not my job or anyone else's job to make everyone feel included. If Wal-Mart wanted to hang a giant sign that said, \"Merry Christmas!\" then that would be their prerogative. If people felt excluded - oh well. Once again, this is no different than Atheists feeling excluded (or awkward) about \"Happy holidays,\" and I'm sure it's no different from how Muslims might feel excluded since Wal-Mart doesn't hang a sign that says, \"Happy Ramadan.\" Also, many times the holidays of Easter and Passover over-lap; for instance Passover in 2010 lasted from March 29 to April 5 [3] and Easter for Christians was on April 4. However, nobody said \"Happy holidays\" despite the fact that 2 major religions were both celebrating holidays at that time. Instead, one either said \"Happy Passover\" or \"Happy Easter,\" and if the person receiving the greeting did not celebrate either/or holiday, then they would simply make a correction if they felt so inclined. No harm no foul. 5. Con says, \"Just because we can say it [Merry Christmas] doesn't man that we should say it or that it is better or more respectful.\" Once again, the exact same thing can be said about \"Happy holidays.\" Con also has not shown why saying \"Merry Christmas\" is disrespectful. Also, I don't think that saying \"Happy holidays\" is more respectful simply because it includes the holiday of one other faith (Judaism) - especially because it implies that one is either Christian or Jewish, as if no other religion or belief system exists. 6. Con notes that 52% of Americans feel offended by the saying, \"Merry Christmas.\" However, this statistic should hold absolutely no weight. For one, CON NEVER CITED THIS SOURCE meaning we have no incentive to believe him. Second, 83% of Americans identify as Christian [4] ... so how can Con's statistic be true?! If more than 8 out of 10 people are Christian, then how can more than 5 out of 10 feel offended by the phrase, \"Merry Christmas?\" I Google'd this statistic and could not find it anywhere [5]. However, I did find that Rasmussen Reports reported 69% of Americans usually greet each other with \"Merry Christmas\" anyway [6] and since most people are Christian, many actually get offended when people say \"Happy holidays\" to them instead. In fact, \"A 2005 survey by Pew Research found that 42 percent of Americans preferred the \"Merry Christmas\" greeting over the non-religious \"Seasons Greetings.\" But 45 percent of Americans said it did not matter what greeting they received\" [7]. The same source expresses how political correctness should never trump our first amendment right to free speech, which is what I was explaining in Point 1 and how I countered Con's argument. Conclusion: Con ends by saying that \"Happy holidays\" is more appropriate because while both terms are inclusive and exclusive, the phrase \"H H\" includes more people. However, I've already explained two things. One - Since 83% of Americans are Christian, it's really not THAT more inclusive. Two - Since all other holidays are ignored, and Atheists do not fit into either category, Con is essentially saying \"Well it's okay if we make the Muslims feel left out so long as we include the Christians, Jews and Africans.\" This presents a double standard and does not solve the dilemma that there will be people left out and/or offended either way. In that case, it's best to let people say whichever phrase they prefer -- probably \"Merry Christmas\" since most people are Christian -- and be open minded if others get offended at people's right to free speech.

Content: I'm going to organize today's debate into three main points. 1. Columbus's Discovery My opponent claims: \"Simple, Columbus didn't discover jack. The Americas had already been flourishing with civilizations thus were in fact inhabited, making the \"discovery\" a bit of an overstatement.\" The reason it's called a \"discovery\" is because the rest of the world didn't know that the Americas were flourishing with civilizations. Thus, for them, it was a huge discovery. The very creation of modern nations in the Americas is a product of trade and travel between Europe and the Americas, which became possible only after Columbus's \"discovery\", accidental or not. Simply because it was an accident does not mean it shouldn't be celebrated. So far, it's evident that Columbus's discovery, accidental or not, deserves celebration. 2. Genocide In addressing my opponent's claims about genocide; as I've proven above, it's a tragedy that such things happened, but Columbus Day doesn't celebrate genocide. Think of Manifest Destiny, a perfect example of how American celebrate what could be a controversial idea (westward expansion at the cost of Native American lives) with good intent. We aren't celebrating their deaths, but rather the triumph of a nation to span an entire continent. Likewise, Columbus Day celebrates the discovery of the new world, not the exploitation of it. Even by definition, \"a day, October 12, observed as a holiday in various states of theU.S. in honor of the discovery of the New World by Columbus and his landing in the West Indies on October 12, 1492\", [1] Columbus Day merely marks his landing in the New World, not the actions that ensued. Which brings us to the biggest point in today's round... 3. Malicious Intent So far, all my opponent has said regarding intent is that since... \"both Columbus and his achievement sincerely do not deserve really any sense of honoring in the first place, intent is unjustified.\" First of all, his achievement does deserve honoring; as I have proven, even thought it may have been accidental, it was a huge discovery for Europeans, and perhaps one of the greatest in history. And secondly, whether or not Columbus's achievement deserves honoring is completely unrelated to whether or not we celebrate it with malicious intent. My opponent must prove that when we celebrate on Columbus Day, we're celebrating the deaths of Native Americans. It sounds like a ridiculous BOP because it is; my opponent has made the claim and now must prove it. Next, My opponent states: \"I fail to see how the deaths of genocidal imperialism compare to the casualties of the Revolutionary War.\" In Round 1, I presented two analogies; the first compared Columbus Day to Independence Day. The point being made was that both days commemorate an event in the past which could be misinterpreted. Much like how it would be unreasonable for the British to think we are celebrating the death of British soldiers when we celebrate Independence day, it is just as unrealistic to assume that we celebrate the deaths of Native on Columbus Day. My second analogy my opponent didn't address. I related Columbus Day to the deeply rooted American principle of Manifest Destiny, or westward expansion. Manifest Destiny is celebrated to this day, taught in textbooks, and has it's own line in the national anthem: \"from sea to shining sea\". And I'm sure we all haven't forgotten how Americans all but wiped out Native Americans as we moved West. For example, the Trail of Tears in 1831 - 1839, when Cherokee's were marched out of their homeland, which resulted in thousands of deaths by exposure; a true genocide [2]. Is my opponent claiming that by continuing to praise Manifest Destiny as an American ideal and by keeping \"sea to shining sea\" in our national anthem, that we are celebrating the deaths of Native Americans? Inconveniently for him; we aren't. And just like how the line \"sea to shining sea\" does not celebrate the killing of Natives, neither does Columbus Day. The Pro's BOP has not been met. ---- Recalling the PRO's Burden of Proof: My opponent again must prove malicious intent in celebrating Columbus Day. Even if a hundred genocides occured, if he cannot prove harmful intent in celebrating the holiday, then he cannot win the round. The BOP of the Pro has not yet been met. The resolution has been negated. [1] http://dictionary.reference.com...

Psalm 14:1 states, \"The fool says in his heart, that there is no God.\" Thus, if an atheist says there is no God, then by scripture, he is a fool and April 1st is his holiday. Get it?

I do argue that political outcomes do affect ALL citizens' lives. For example, budget spending, the increase or decrease of dollars allotted to social programs. In 2013 the food stamp budget was cut from $75 billion to $39 billion. Taking into account 47.8 million people were on some sort of food assistance during an economic depression; 14.5% of the population was affected. The federal government also makes policy pertaining to criminal justice with penalties and guidelines, which also includes the ATF. Civil Rights, pertaining to discrimination, gender issues, and same sex marriage, to point out a recent issue. Taxation affects every family, and well, as education policies, environmental regulations, Medicare, Social Security, as well as foreign affairs. At some junction the government does impact on every citizen young, old, voter or non-voter, even green card holders who can\"t vote at the Federal level. On the point of a single vote reflecting an outcome, \"minuscule to even count,\" in certain elections that is true. Some presidents came to office not by the popular vote, but by Electoral College votes. George W. Bush for example when Al Gore received the popular vote; as well as Benjamin Harrison and John Quincy Adams. Enacting your premise that the Electoral College be based on actual voters, here are projections. Using the last Presidential 2012 election as basis for the argument, there was an estimation of 57.5% of the registered voting population turning out. 222 Million people were eligible to vote (VEP). Of this number, 52 million were not registered. 170 million actual voters cast a ballot representing 56.5% of the total population of 313 million. It is projected that there will be a further decrees in voter participation in the next Presidential election due to new eligibility requirements; example: Photo IDs. These have become very contentious in some states and are more frequently enacted in the Republican held South Eastern and South Central States. The premise is to prevent voter fraud (.00000013% of voters convicted in fraud cases). On the flip side, it is argued ID requirements are being used to disenfranchise the voting poor, as well as black and Latin populations that are more prevalent in these states and who\"s rates of casting ballots are as high as 70% (scratch your chin for a moment on this one) Let\"s assume with this data that actual voters decline just by a conservative estimate of 2%; it still represents just slightly more than half of the total US population; that includes children (24% of the total) that are considered on what affects their lives. 45% of the remaining people need to have representation, whether they vote or not. The Electoral College facilitates this end being based on population. To enact an electoral college based on actual voters would further the divide of true representation, especially along party lines. Many have reason and want to vote, but can\"t. Though apathy may loom large, in southern states as well as rural population areas; being considered as a part of a citizenry is a must. Addressing your point with Oregon, Maine and Minnesota; they are voter friendly states. Oregon has a vote by mail system. Maine and Minnesota has same day voter registration with no voter ID requirements. Texas has one of the strictest voter ID laws which continues to be contested in the Supreme Court. And yes, we are in agreement that voter incentives are needed to produce a higher turnout. But as the tide turns, it appears that the ability to vote is being skewed to the other majority, whites over 30 with incomes greater than the national average. A day off work holiday to vote would be a nice start, but registration, ID and other voter friendly policies need to be addressed, not a change in the Electoral College. https://en.wikipedia.org... http://www.usatoday.com... http://www.usimmigrationblog.com... http://www.enchantedlearning.com... http://www.loc.gov... http://americanhistory.about.com... http://www.diffen.com... http://thedataweb.rm.census.gov... http://ballotpedia.org... http://abcnews.go.com... http://www.cnn.com...", "qid": 44, "docid": "cfd5ba5f-2019-04-18T14:18:09Z-00002-000", "score": 7.691800117492676}, {"content": "Title: August Tournament - Resolved: In a democracy, voting ought to be compulsory Content: Rebuttal R1: Right to Abstain Con argues that \"compulsory voting is inherently anti-democratic\" because it denies people the right to abstain from voting. First of all, my opponent is simply wrong. CV doesn't deny people the right to abstain from voting. A voter has the right to spoil a ballot and in effect abstain from voting. This is called informal voting [1]. So Con's claim is simply untrue. Under CV, the people's only \"duty is to show up at the polling station, receive a ballot and deposit it, marked or not, into the ballot box\" [4]. To justify this, I remind my opponent that citizens have rights and duties, such as jury duty or duty to show in court as a witness if one was served a subpoena. I also remind my opponent that rights are not absolute and can be limited if \"only if it can show that the limit is set out in a law; pursues an important goal which can be justified in a free and democratic society; and pursues that goal in a reasonable and proportionate manner. [5]\" The simple duty of Compulsory Voting meets all these criteria which makes it justifiable and reasonable. What's the fine if someone doesn't vote in Australia? It's simply 20 Australian dollars [4]. That's it. And you'd be penalized only if you cannot provide a good reason for not voting. So it's a very lenient penalty and it's mainly meant as a wakeup call. I don't support heavier fines. Second, Con may be assuming that a large number of those who don't vote actually wanted to intentionally abstain from voting. But this is also untrue. CV has led to a significant increase in voter turnout (By more than 30 percentage points in Australia [2]), while the highest informal vote percentages in Australia were 6.34% in 1984 and 5.92% in 2013 [3]. What's important to note that CV led to an increase of at least 25% in turnout who wouldn't have voted otherwise in a voluntary system. That's about one quarter of eligible voters. Therefore CV is clearly a better system than voluntary voting. Finally, I argue that the protest vote for those who want to abstain from voting under CV is more superior that under a voluntary voting system. When people don't vote in a voluntary system, it's unclear how much was the protest vote. Are people not voting because they are protesting, or because they are lazy? It doesn't send the message to the politicians that protesters want to send. In Australia, you can easily see that roughly around 5.92% chose to abstain. But in the US, it's unsure how many of the 63.6% who didn't vote in 2014 elections actually chose to abstain. In summary, I showed that: 1. CV doesn't infringe on the right of citizens to abstain 2. CV is legally and constitutionally justified 3. CV better demonstrates the protest vote R2: The Apathetic Vote This contention is hardly any different than the previous one. Before I rebut this argument, I just wanted to remind my opponent that this debate doesn't only concern the US. Also, just because someone doesn't associate with the Democratic or Republican party, doesn't mean that they wouldn't want to vote in an election. In any case, I agree with Con that some people are not interested in the political process. Con then argues that \"In order for a democracy to truly be democratic, it should be able to account for these people and allow them to express their voices by not voting for anyone.\" What Con is actually arguing for is the right for apathetic people to abstain from voting. Essentially, this is the same argument as the first contention. As I've explained earlier, apathetic voters can still maintain their rights not to vote under a Compulsory Voting system. So CV still allows them to express their voice by not voting for anyone. There is no unique benefit to voluntary voting, except to reward procrastination. Also, I've shown in my opening case that voting helps educate people and engages them in the political process. While I agree that some will remain apathetic, others may become more interested which makes CV more beneficial. R3: Rational Voters Con argues that \"Successful theoretical models of democracy utilize the concept of the \"rational voter\", assuming that the voting population is made of well-informed & educated people who are committed to choosing the leader they believe will best govern the country\". This is a bare assertion. Con didn't provide any sources to suggest that this is the case. Am I supposed to simply agree? In fact, Con is wrong. Democracy is about representing all the people [6]. It doesn't matter if the voters are more smart or not, educated or not, well-informed or not, literate or not. In India where about a quarter are illiterate, people were asked to \"identify their choices by party symbols such as a hand, lotus, or elephant\" [7]. Almost in every democratic country, there is support for assisted voting [8]. Ace Project writes that \"access to opportunities to vote is a guiding principle for voting operations, and a cornerstone of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\" It also cites \"the United Nations Human Rights Committee\u2019s General Comment on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Article 25, which mentions the steps that electoral administrators should take to allow everyone to exercise their right to vote\" [8]. In summary, education or rationality is not a requirement for eligibility to vote. Also, Con assumes that those who vote are rational. This is not necessarily the case. A poll showed that many people are misinformed about the issues. James Agresti writes \"poll provides evidence that voters are often ill-informed and may be casting their ballots based upon misconceptions\" [9]. And finally, if democracy is best achieved by an increase of \"rational voters\", then there might be a case to allow only those with relatively good IQ's, educated and literate citizens to vote. But this is not an argument against a CV system. So in summary, I've demonstrated that: 1. Rationality is not a requirement for voting 2. Democracy is about representing all the people including the uneducated and the illiterate 3. If rationality is a requirement for voting, then maybe there's a case to only allow those who are intelligent and educated. But it's not an argument against CV. Counter Plan I thank my opponent for the Counter Plan. I think that election day should be a national holiday too or on a weekend. What Con essentially proved that Voter Turnout is very important for a democracy, and that's why he recommends reducing obstacles to help increase voter turnout. But what Con failed to show is how much of an increase in voter turnout will this yield. Will it increase the voter turnout to numbers close to those that a CV system yields? He doesn't provide any evidence. In fact Japan and France which hold holidays on Sundays [10], had voter turnouts of just 52.66% [11] and 55.4% [12] respectively. These are terrible numbers! Therefore, while I appreciate the proposal, there is no evidence that the proposal would yield the returns that my opponent is hoping for. The benefits from implementing CV are much greater and more evident. Thank you. Sources [1] http://www.aec.gov.au... [2] Round 2 \u2013 Pro's case [3] http://electionwatch.edu.au...

And it is certainly not a well-known fact in the public eye. There were many more well-known discoveries, such as Newton's discovery of gravity and Franklin's discovery of electricity. However, we do not celebrate Isaac Newton Day or Ben Franklin day. Columbus' discovery of trade winds, something which few people know of and which is quesionable (due to the support of such few sources), should hence not be a holiday. 2) The opponent has dropped his claim \"Columbus launched the Age of Discovery. \" This statement was a fabrication that was not upheld by his given source, so I thank my opponent for dropping it. Whether or not Columbus \"made the largest contribution to the movement\" is a completely subjective matter. I could just as well say that Bartolomew Dias' discovery of an Indian sea trade route was the most important contribution to the movement. The opponent's opinion is not a criterion for whether or not a holiday should exist. The same goes for the statement \"He contributed the largest discovery of the time. .. \" These are strictly the opponent's opinions. i. The opponent believes the Columbian exchange should be celebrated, despite the large number of Native American deaths it caused, because \"[i]t was one of the most important events in the history of the modern world. \" The Holocaust and 9/11 were \"important\" and \"monumental\" events, but we do not celebrate them as a holiday. Celebrating the period in history that led to the loss of countless lives would be immoral and offensive. In fact, South Dakota changed Columbus Day to Native American Day [1], in order to placate tensions arising from the unforgiving Native Americans. ii. Some of the opposition against Columbus Day actually stems from Columbus' personality, which the opponent depicts as admirable. The Columbus wrote in his logbook (about the American Indians): \"They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. .. . They would make fine servants. .. . With 50 men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want. \" [2] (He was ready to take advantage of the Native Americans and exploit them for his own benefit. ) Columbus was, according to documents, far too \"ambitious,\" ready to do terribly immoral things just to reach his goals:\"While giving the brilliant mariner his due, the collection portrays Columbus as an unrelenting social climber and self-promoter who stopped at nothing\u2014 not even exploitation, slavery, or twisting Biblical scripture\u2014 to advance his ambitions\u2026,\" states a pundit researching documents from Columbus' era. [2] ---An Overview: 1. Columbus' discovery of trade winds is questionable and relatively insignificant when compared to other major discoveries in history (a vast majority of which do not have holidays. )2. The opponent's attempts to state that Columbus' voyages were the highlight of the Age of Discovery. This is completely a matter of opinion. i. The opponent states that Columbus Day should be celebrated because of the importance of the Columbian Exchange. The genocide of Native Americans (which happened as a direct result of the Exchange), however, is certainly not a matter that should be celebrated as a U. S. holiday, just as Germany does not have a holiday for the Holocaust. ii. The opponent's perceptions of Columbus' personality mostly consist of speculation. According to document, Columbus was ruthless, willing to enslave Native Americans and exploit others for the purpose of reaching his goals. ---Conclusion: Therefore, Columbus Day should not be a holiday. The opponent's reasoning for why it should be a holiday has been effectively countered, and his arguments are null. ---As an aside, I would like to note my opponent's use of blatantly fabricated statements (e. g. , \"Columbus launched the Age of Discovery\") in his argument that were not supported by his sources.

Top 10 Reasons Why I Love Christmas Christmas has always been my favorite holiday. Not just my favorite holiday, mind you, but my favorite time of year, period. It's not necessarily because of the presents, although I do love buying presents and receiving them isn't bad either. And I'm not religious either. There's just something about the season, the time of year, and the atmosphere that makes Christmas my all-time favorite. 10 . The weather is one of a kind. I live in the Bay Area of California, so we don't exactly experience snow to the extent the East Coast does. However, winter still means mittens and scarves for us. Skirts and flip flops get old (though there are those who still stick to them when it's cold). 9. The movies and music are unforgettable. Christmas music has become such a significant part of my holiday experience. It starts when my mom and I wake up at 4 a.m. for Black Friday shopping (which we have done for years), and we drive over the river and through the woods to go to the stores - we listen to the same Christmas albums every year (including Kenny Rogers and Celine Dion), and it isn't Christmas to me without them. \"Jingle All the Way\" is one of those movies the whole family can watch without getting mad (except when my parents gripe about Arnold's job as Governor of California). Otherwise, we all enjoy those holiday films and episodes we scrape out from the bottom of the VHS box and view... old school \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" Garfield and Charlie Brown Christmas specials, and, of course, \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" 8. Things smell so good. Christmas trees, cinnamon and spices, cold ground after rain and snow, baking hams... yeah... 7. The food is delicious and so special. Besides fruitcakes, there are dozens of holiday treats that make my mouth water. Egg nog and Christmas cookies included... these are things I look forward to every year. 6. The decorations are fantastic. Face it: nothing can beat the loaded window displays, the ribbons and garlands around every lamp post, the glittering lights of various colors and doilies, and nativity scenes, and the trees...! 5. ...Presents. Need I say more? I'm a big fan of wrapping presents as well (not true for my dad though). I am known for buying my presents early and being able to find the best gifts. There's nothing like finding the perfect gift for someone and seeing their reaction when they rip open the wrapping paper. 4. It's not necessarily JUST for Christians and Catholics. I am not of any denomination, yet I absolutely adore Christmas. It has become so commercialized that agnostics like myself can still experience it. But the devout can still enjoy the holiday for everything it symbolizes and celebrates religiously. To me, the wonder and glory of Christmas as I know it is something I want to share with everyone. And who knows? Usually I go to church with my Christian mother and partake in the songs too. I may not be very pious, but I respect what Christmas means to those who are. 3. It's celebrated all over the world. While there are world issues that separate nations and peoples, Christmas is something that people around the world can share. 2. Family comes together. Christmas is about the only time of year I see people outside my immediate family. They come to the house and we get to regroup for the first time in 364 days. It's the closest I feel to my family and it makes me feel so grateful to have them in my life. 1. Everything is so happy. In spite of mad shoppers and grumpy retail workers, I revel in the air of Christmas. As cliche as it sounds, it really is magical to me.

The 26th is when the First Fleet from England landed at Sydney Cove and Captain Arthur Phillip took possession of the land for the British Empire in 1788. The day was first recognised in the 1880's, but only as an anniversary of the first landing. In 1946 it changed to Australia Day and in 1994 it became a public holiday and a day to welcome new citizens or honour people who have done a great service to the country. The National Australia Day Council recognises it as \"a day to reflect on what we have achieved and what we can be proud of in our great nation\", but the date means that not everyone can join in on this, because for some people the very day means nothing but sorrow and mourning. These people are Aboriginals.

His accomplishment of reaching America made him a hero in those communities. But how did he go from being a hero in the Italian and Catholic groups to being a hero in the United States? First of all, he did not \"discover\" America. Unless you ignore world history until this point, you know that there were native tribes living in the Americas for centuries before Columbus landed, so how can you \"discover\" something when there is already someone living there. Not only that, he never even touched down into the modern-day United States. He explored islands in the Caribbean and in central America, not in the present day United States. The Vikings were the first Europeans that we know of that came to the Americas [1]. So if the Vikings were the first Europeans over here (and in North America), why is it Columbus that gets the credit? The first European colony in the modern-day United States was Ponce de Leon in modern-day Florida. The United States derived from the British colonies...so again, why is it Columbus that we celebrate? Aside from the fact that Columbus had no bearing on the modern-day United States, his name should be erased from this holiday due to his treatments towards the native tribes. The native tribes that Columbus encountered (Taino) were murdered, raped, and enslaved by Columbus and his men [2]. Columbus blamed the Taino for the failures and laziness of his own men. The Taino greeted Columbus with peace and generosity and yet he treated them with hostility. My final point in this round is that there are only two holidays here in the United States that are named after individuals; Columbus Day and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Washington's birthday has been reduced to an overall President's Day. It appalls me that Columbus has a holiday named after him, but Washington, the father of our country, Lincoln, who in a round about way ended slavery, nor heroes like Pat Tillman have holidays named after them....you know, TRUE HEROES!

However, it must be understood that the so-called \"war on Christmas\" is not related the the realm of these private relationships. Rather, people become offended when \"Merry Christmas\" is uttered by politicians, teachers, and other public figures without giving any thought to people that may celebrate other holidays or no holidays at all.

Why use a greeting that only speaks to certain people, when there is a much more inclusive greeting available? \"Merry Christmas\" is an exclusive phrase because it ignores Jews, Muslims, etc. that celebrate holidays other than Christmas.

I agree that the protection of individual rights and the common good are also crucial when considering what ought to be the case in a democracy.Nevertheless, this concession in no way harms my case. This is because compulsory voting doesn't violate a single individual right and it also maximises the common good due to the apparent trend where democracy is linked to the general welfare of the populace (1) (hence a more democratic system - compulsory voting - would probably increase general welfare).TurnoutCon is entirely incorrect here; he claims that I 'immediately contradict [myself] by arguing that certain people are unfit to rule'. I never said anything of the sort.He also argues that a high voter turnout isn't inherently good. Maybe so, but it is inherently democratic, and therefore it will prima facie accord with the common good. Con does say that it would have been better for the Jews to have voted more than the Nazis, but it is uncontroversial to say this because we have the benefit of hindsight. In the present day, it would be extremely bigoted to say that one group of people is less worthy of political representation in Government.Democracy should involve everyone. Even if we view someone's views as extremist or stupid, it is still democratic and better for the common good to ensure that everyone is involved. Thus I would still advocate that a high voter turnout is, prima facie, a good thing - one that compulsory voting will actualize.Con says I don't provide evidence that low-turnout elected governments are less legitimate than high-turnout elected governments. This is wrong, I did provide evidence that in a low-turnout election, it is more likely to turn out that the majority of the population didn't support the victorious government. Conversely, this is less likely to happen if we have a high voter turnout.To illustrate, we have two elections:Election 1- 60% turnout- Labour party wins by 70% majorityElection 2- 90% turnout- Labour party wins by 70% majorityIn election 1, only 42% of the population actually supported the Labour party. In election 2, this figure is 63%.In which election is the Labour party more legitimate? Obviously the latter because in that one, the majority of the population support them.This proves my point that a higher turnout will increase the chances that the victorious government will be legitimate. Of course, the chances of a government having majority support are much lower in a multi-party system, and yes, because of this there will be a smaller chance that the government in a multi-party system will be as legitimate as the same party in a two-party system. Nevertheless, even in a multi-party system, the increased turnout resulting from compulsory voting will still increase the chances that the winning government will be more legitimate.Having a legitimate government is both more democratic and better for the common good, since people are more likely to trust in the government and be content with their authority if they are aware that the government's authority is legitimate. For example, in the UK earlier this year, the Conservative party won the General Election with only 36.9% of the vote (2), this caused bitterness and protests, in which a common complaint was that people felt the government was illegitimate (3). In other words, a less legitimate government is more likely to result in unrest, political apathy and anti-government feeling - all symptoms of a less happy society.Tax credits could work, but they are financially inferior to my plan. I'll expand on this later.AccessibilityWhilst there are many things that would help solve the problem of inaccessibility to voting, compulsory voting is the solution that would be the most effective. If voting was compulsory, then there would be a legal mandate to help everyone to vote - after all, nobody wants to see a disabled person punished simply because he couldn't get to a polling station by himself. Because nobody wants to see that, this would place a mandate on society to assist anyone who needs it to cast their vote. This is shown in the case of Australia, which has a plethora of help and assistance available for disabled/elderly voters (4).If voting is optional, then there is an attitude of, 'why should I help this person cast their vote? It's not as if they need to vote'.National holidays are all very well, but they do cost the economy a fair bit (5) and still wouldn't help those who don't work but still struggle to leave the house. The same applies to early voting and same-day registration; all these help solve the problem, but none moreso than compulsory voting.Con claims that, if voting is compulsory, it will end up punishing the hard-working and disabled people. This would be the case if my plan wasn't accompanied by policies that would give the disabled assistance in casting their vote, to the extent that nobody should fear being on the wrong side of the law because they were unable to reach a polling station. But I advocate such policies, as does Australia - the poster-child for compulsory voting.Furthermore, if voting is compulsory then there is a mandate for employers to permit their employees the chance to vote - hence there is no worry of a hard-working person being punished because they were kept at work during election day. If this did happen to be the case, then the punishment would fall on the employer. In contrast, if voting was optional then employers have no obligation to allow their employees time to vote - after all, it's not as if they need to vote if voting is merely optional.EducationWhilst there is no empirical evidence linking compulsory voting to an increase in political knowledge, the reasoning for such a link remains cogent.Compare a compulsory voting system and an optional voting system. All else being equal, the former is more likely to prompt people to educate themselves politically. This is because of the fact that one cannot choose to isolate themselves from political involvement if voting is compulsory, whereas someone can choose to isolate themselves if voting is optional. There might not be a large difference, but it is a difference nonetheless. If someone is required to vote, then this will create a demand for education - after all, if people are required to participate in something then they will naturally want to learn about what it is they are required to participate in. To give an example, if people are required to attend a football game every year, then this will increase the level of football-knowledge because the mandatory-participation prompts people to educate themselves.Con writes that the large amount of election coverage in the media is enough to educate anyone 'through sheer osmosis'. Yet this is passive education, where you inevitably absorb some information just by exposure to it. Compulsory voting would encourage people to take an active approach and seek out political information. The latter is preferable because it avoids many of the media biases that would be exacerbated by passive political education.ExtremismCon's rebuttal here exclusively refers to the American system of primary elections, yet this debate doesn't explicitly pertain to the USA. In countries such as the UK and Australia, voting is for members of an unlimited amount of different political parties, unlike the two party system in the US. Hence Con's rebuttal doesn't harm my case here.Just to clarify, I do not think that extremists voting is a bad thing - of course I don't. I think that disproportionate representation is a bad and undemocratic thing. Because extremists are more likely to vote than moderates, this means that extremists are given representation that their number does not warrant. The moderates may have consented by refraining from voting, but this doesn't resolve the issue. The principles of democracy require equal representation.Con's counterplanTax credits may grow the economy - any government spending does. But the issue is that if government spending is given through tax credits, that spending is being redirected from more worthy projects such as schools or hospitals. Tax credits for voting would needlessly use up money that could be spent on infrastructure and housing. Whilst the counterplan may grow the economy, my plan is superior because it frees up the money so it can be spent on more worthy investments. Therefore, my plan is more economically benefitial.Undemocratic?It may be best to let other countries decide their own policies, but that is irrelevant to this debate. We are supposed to be debating whether it is preferential to have compulsory voting in a democracy, not whether we should force countries to implement it. Con's talk of 'neocolonialism' is therefore a giant strawman.RightsAs part of my plan, I would advocate that all voting mediums allow for ballots to be spoilt. Hence avoiding the accusation of violating the right no to vote. Con writes that people may be dissuaded by fear of spoiling being illlegal, but the only evidence he gives is that '\"Is it illegal to spoil your vote?\" brings 125,000 hits on Google'. But Google hits are no reflection on whether a query is a common one; for example, a search of 'giant strawberry gorilla hybrid' brings 489,000 hits.I do accept the Sherbet test, but Con's counterplan is arguably more intrusive than my own. By financially rewarding those who vote, the Government is effectively punishing people for not voting. It's like if people were given tax credits to work on Sundays, this would feel like a punishment to those Christians who believe that we shouldn't violate the Sabbath._____(1) http://bit.ly...(2) http://bit.ly...(3) http://bit.ly...(4) http://bit.ly...(5) http://bit.ly...", "qid": 44, "docid": "790c6317-2019-04-18T14:20:46Z-00001-000", "score": 7.378399848937988}, {"content": "Title: Christmas is the most important Christian holiday.

And you can argue that these people aren't truly voting for these candidates, that they are forced to. But this relates to another one my arguments - what happens if someone corrupt gets into office, like North Korea? Even if small or large groups support this corrupt leadership doesn't matter - the fact is that they are able to get into public office and dictate everybody life. Whether small or large groups support the corruption is besides the point. \"What you are proposing is a communist confederation.\" This is a statement I made. In a way, yes you are.

The problem is that rich tend to settle in more affluent areas and the poor in poorer areas. This is a trend that cannot be erased even in under a single government.I don't get why this is so impressive, in your eyes. Yes, there are no borders to block resources - but there are other ways of solving this issue between nations. Free trade, for example. And even under one government, there would still be an inequality. \"What I am saying is that people from the poor parts can migrate to the places with job, while enterprise or capital can go to places with more resources and cheaper labor.\"We have the ability to do that now, and large disparity still occurs. The poorer citizens live in cities, where jobs are available. Enterprise and capital go to places with cheaper labor and resources - areas such as East Asia. I don't understand your argument pertaining to this issue. It doesn't make sense - one nation cannot lighten the burden of disparity, period. \"The only claim I made was that national borders won't hinder such transfers anymore.\"Free trade without all the issues, plain and simple. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would like to sum my stance to the voters. A single government would not lighten the burden of great disparity, as my opponent suggested; it would simply be on a much larger scale. In the US, we have naturally rich areas, and naturally poor areas. It is just the way things are - but, a single government could not solve these issues any better. My opponent claims that borders are the problem, that if we erase borders then we can transport things easier. One - there's a less-controversial alternative to this problem: free trade. Second - it seems as if my opponent is completely anti-border, yet he supports individual states making their own decisions on policy issues and holidays. He is stating here that the world is too diverse to government under a single government, that local governments can govern themselves, and supports a confederacy. This form of government has not proved successful in the past. My opponent said that a World Legislature can vote on issues. The problem with that is: the world is too full of ideas that there would not be a majority in this Congress. There would be Communists (which could garner significant support from areas such as China), Conservatives, Liberals, Islamists, Socialists, etc. There would no majority, and nothing would get passed by this legislature.A single government comes with too many problems to be a success, is my argument.

In response to my opponent's rebuttals, I should like to respond as follows: The fact that are so many different Christian practices and beliefs and its many variances in religious holiday dates demonstrates what an unprincipled and duplicitous religion Christianity really is, and why it has so many factions: Roman Catholics; Baptists; Methodists; Lutherans; Quakers; Pentecostals; Presbyterians; Latter-day Saints; Seventh-day Adventists, Restorationists; followers of Eastern Orthodoxy; Jehovah's Witnesses and Anglicans and members of countless other denominations all call themselves Christians yet they all have wildly different rituals and customs. That's because Christianity is a religion that gets blown about by the wind: rather than stand firmly by its doctrines and scriptures, it amends and adopts its teachings to accommodate the popular wants and beliefs of the general public at any given time and place. And that's why the Catholic Church no longer persecutes people that have been educated and know that the Sun does not revolve around the Earth - even though that concept was once considered heretical; that's also why the Church of England permits divorce; contraception; abortion and women priests while other churches don't, and it's also why Easter Day falls on different dates every year but Christmas Day always falls on the same date every year, although that date varies from denomination to denomination as we already know. Throughout its history, the Christian churches have always done whatever they had to in order to appease the masses: whether that be signing a pact with Hitler and abandoning the Jews to their fate in Nazi Germany; or whether that be the devout Roman Catholic prince Vlad the Impaler (the son of Vlad Dracul who was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula) skewering 60,000 Ottomans on sharpened stakes in the name of Christianity in 15th Century Wallachia; or whether it be hijacking a pre-Christian mid-winter festival and passing its traditions and customs off as Christian. In short, the Christian churches have always done what ever it took to fill their collection boxes. Moving on, my opponent talks about \"Christmas\" (Christ's mass) being celebrated as a secular holiday by some while being observed as a religious festival by others, but the reality is that the true meaning of Yuletide has largely been forgotten and everybody thinks of Christmas as a Christian holiday (holy day). Few people now realise that iconic \"Christmas\" symbols such as holly, ivy, mistletoe, Yule logs, \"Christmas\" trees and \"Christmas\" lights all pre-date Christianity (and reindeers are not a native species of the Holy Land) and they have all just been appropriated by Christianity. Even Christmas carols were originally folk songs sung during Harvest-tide. Of course, there is no reason why people of other faiths or Christian denominations should not join in the mid-winter celebrations but they tend not to: December 25th is just another working day in China, India, Japan and Russia as well as in most African, Middle-Eastern and South-East Asian countries, although December 25th is a national holiday in Pakistan, but that's to celebrate the birthday of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, not Jesus Christ. However, it is not right that Christians in the West should muddy the waters by sending Christmas cards with nativity scenes and other religious images printed on them and by attending \"Christmas\" carol services at church while also decorating their homes with \"Christmas\" trees, \"Christmas\" lights, holly and ivy and thus spreading the myth that the mid-winter festivities have something to do with Christianity - they have their Christmas Day in January and they should stick to it. I deliberately have not mentioned Santa Claus, by the way, not because he has anything to do with the birth of Christ, he doesn't, but because the character is based on Saint Nicholas who was, at least, a Christian - although he actually lived in Asia Minor, not the North Pole and Saint Nicholas Day is actually the 6th December, not the 25th December. My opponent also claims there is nothing wrong with Christianity adopting other culture's traditions. Firstly, I would remark that it is odd that it has done so, as the other Abrahamic religions, Judaism and Islam have not and, secondly, I suspect that many Christians would complain if Islam or Judaism did adopt Christian practices and pass them off as their own in countries outside the Abrahamic religions' homelands in the Middle East. To illustrate this point, let's consider the spread of Islam in the West. In most of Europe Christianity is in decline and Islam is on the rise. For example, here in Britain, the 2011 Census showed that 59.3% of the population adhered to Christianity, down from 71.6% in 2001, while 4.8% of the population adhered to Islam, up from 2.7% in 2001. Additionally, a report entitled \"The Future of the Church\" found that more people regularly attended a mosque in 2004 than regularly attended church, while a study issued by Christian Research found that the number of Muslims attending services at British mosques will double the number of Christians attending church services by 2040. So, if Islam is becoming the dominant religion is what we think of as \"Christian\" countries then it will be completely appropriate, following my opponent's logic, for Islam to adopt Christmas, just as Christianity adopted Yuletide. Would my opponent and his fellow Christians approve, I wonder, if, in the not-too-distant future, the 25th December was to be officially renamed \"Milad un Nabi Day\" - the celebration of birth of the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon Him)? The Prophet (peace be upon Him) wasn't born on 25th December, by the way, but then again neither was Jesus Christ, so who cares? Of course, not much would change at first as there would be too much public resistance, and the differences in the celebrations would be subtle and introduced gradually - just as Christianity overcame Yuletide in small increments. But after a while Father Christmas would become known as Father Milad un Nabi and it would be the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon Him) depicted in the manger, not Jesus Christ, and, of course, drinking alcohol and playing music would be frowned upon while praying to Mecca would be encouraged. Finally, if my opponent thinks traditional Christian dishes are unappetising he may still prefer them to the traditional Islamic dishes that would be served on Milad un Nabi Day, delicacies such as tabbouleh (bulgur wheat salad); kale pasche (boiled sheep brains, eyes, tongue and hooves) and ful madammas (dried beans). I suspect that my opponent, like most people in Europe and America, would resent the Islamification of Christmas, even though they might not be Christians, and they might complain about it in similar terms that I have about the Christianisation of Yule, even though I am not a Pagan. That's why I reassert that practicing Christians should not be invited to participate in our traditional seasonal festivities. Thank you for reading and Yuletide Greetings to you all!

What do I have to do to win this debate? This sounds like you just wanted to poke fun at atheists, not like you had something interesting the argue about. I searched on the internet for a court case involving the lack of an \"Atheist holiday,\" but could find no reference to an actual court case. What I did find was a myriad of internet JOKES about a case in florida like this, with the punch line of \"you already have april fool's day.\" You say \"no joke this has been brought up in many state courts nationwide.\" Since YOU make this claim, YOU have the burden of proof. Either present evidence for this claim (i.e., the names of some court cases we could reference), or admit that we have no reason to believe these cases exist. Now, of course \"the idea of an atheist being upset/discriminated by a theist holiday\" makes no sense. In fact I have never heard of an atheist complaining about the existence of a theist holiday. What they DO complain about is government endorsement of theist holidays. Of course whether this is legitimate or not isn't pertinent to the debate. As to the \"April Fool's Day\" Issue: 1) I have never known an atheist to celebrate or consider April Fool's Day an atheist holiday. I have seen atheists celebrate (as a joke) the autumnal equinox and 11/11 (palindrome day). If atheists do not celebrate a day, it seems silly to think that it is a holiday for them. 2) It is extremely ironic to decide \"BY SCRIPTURE\" that April 1st is an atheist holiday. Why would an atheist holiday be based on scripture? 3) If Christians are justified in deciding Atheists have a holiday on April 1st by Christian standards (i.e., scripture), then Atheists can do the same thing to Christians and say that Groundhog's day is a Christian holiday, because Christians believe in nonsensical and meaningless rituals.

I hope that he will be able to respond to my R2 arguments as well as counter-rebut my R3 ones.RebuttalsRe: Representation and FocusState-by-state representation will not be needed in a national popular vote because each vote would be individual and would have no accordance with the state that citizen lives in. It is unfair to give a voter more value in an election simply because they happen to live in a state with smaller borders. If that state's borders were expanded for some reason, or the voter moved to a larger state, then the vote's value would drop. Small states would be over-represented. This is much less fair for people living in big states - their votes don't count as much toward the result as small states do. A national popular vote would eliminate thisproblem and ensure that every vote is equal the next. States need not be relevant in a national election.Regional concerns would be more prevalent in large states versus small states, since there is more space in larger states for problems to arise. The fact that Rhode Island has one regional concern would be of much more proportion to California with its five thousand regional concerns.There is no reason to abolish the Senate because the Senate serves the purpose of representing the states several times a month on many different issues, not like the EC which is only used every four years for one issue only: the next president of the U.S. The Senate can address each state's issues without needing to ask the state which candidate the majority of its citizens support.Re: ModerationWith the EC, candidates tend to only campaign in the states that matter: swing states. It would be pointless for a Republican candidate to campaign in a solid blue state and vice versa. With or without the EC, there is no reason for a candidate to visit a small town because there are few people living in that town that would affect the election outcome. Since rural areas already trend red, campaigning there is pointless.Candidates will moderate their policies regardless of whether there are swing states or not. It may be true that swing states will be appealing to candidates, but if there is no EC at all then the candidates will want to moderate their policies to appeal to all of America, not just a few states. Even if that was not the case, it doesn't matter a whole lot whether a policy is moderated or not. America will vote on what it wants, and that will make America happier because a popular vote is a direct representation of democracy in comparison to a flawed EC.Re: Clear WinnerTo dissect this argument, we must first find out why it is being contended that a clear winner in an election would be better than a close one. Two factors have been brought up: recounting and votes and a number of fraud attempts at a result of it.RecountingMy opponent has attempted to paint recounting in a bad light. However, recounting in a direct popular vote would not be all that bad. We must first consider that the new president isn't inaugurated until late January[1], leaving plenty of time from election day in early November to the day the president-elect takes office. 2\u00bd months is enough time to recount a nation's votes, seeing as how the votes on Election Day are all counted in one sitting. Also, the only time the nation would recount every person's vote would possibly be if the election was as close as the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy one. Even if there was a difference of a million votes between the candidates (such as the 2012 one), the election still wouldn't be close enough to trigger a national recount. Only in rare settings where the votes are really close would a recount be considered. To add, a recount would be much less likely in a national popular vote because there would be a single large national pool of votes instead of 51 separate pools.FraudSince fraud was brought up, it'd be proper for this subject to be addressed by the other side. It was claimed that a long recount time would risk further fraud opportunities. But because it is a baseless assertion to say \"a recount would take months and months\", there is no point in taking this argument seriously. We know that in each election, the votes are counted in one day, so fraud opportunities would not be higher. In fact, they would be lower because recounts would be less frequent as I pointed out earlier. Fraud attempts would actually be more frequent with the EC because the people committing fraud would know that if they did it enough, it might tip the vote balance of that state causing the entire state to go for the other candidate. In a popular vote, this wouldn't happen because each vote is individual and would have no effect on the state that vote was casted in. Fraud attempts would only give a candidate a few extra votes and there would be no risk of an entire state switching its votes because of it.Re: ConfusionIt is another baseless assertion that the two-party system would collapse because of a loss of the EC. If no candidate received 270 electoral votes in the EC, one from the three candidates with the most votes would be chosen by the Senate anyways. In a national popular vote, the candidate with the most votes would be elected as chosen by the people. Also, since few people vote for the party they know is going to lose, there would be no reason for the people to begin voting for third party candidates more often without the EC.Your turn, Con!Sources1. http://en.wikipedia.org...2. http://www.archives.gov...", "qid": 44, "docid": "55c05f7c-2019-04-18T15:19:28Z-00003-000", "score": 7.289000034332275}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: 'Vagina Day' should be a national holiday Content: Right out of the batting box I'd like to establish a few thing: a.

[2] . http://bit.ly... [3] . http://1.usa.gov... [4] . http://bit.ly... That said, it is my contention that vagina is unwarranted. Women are already celebrated in our society to a significant degree, by continuing to focus so heavily on women we create a systematic inequality among men and women. 1. Societal celebration of women- As I've already shown the rates for prostate and breast cancer are roughly the same[3]. Let's put aside for just a moment that both men and women can get breast cancer[5] whereas only men can get prostate cancer. The real impact here is our focus on health. Despite the rates of these cancers being about equal breast cancer research receives a significantly higher amount funding than any other type of cancer[3]. Our society akins breast cancer to women, and supports it so as to help women. This is proof that we value women [5] . http://bit.ly... Further, let's compare two holidays already in place: Mother's day and Father's day. Out society spent about 5.9 Billion dollars more on Mother's day in 2008 than we did on father's day[6]. Furthermore we see that Men spend on average twice as much as women do on Valentines day[7]. [6] . http://bit.ly... [7] . http://bit.ly... So from this you can take home that we already place a huge value on women. There simply isn't a need for another holiday to express our gratitude towards them. But there is a second, even more potent issue that must be discussed when one discusses the legitimacy of 'vagina day', and that's the role of men. 2. Male Disposability- Whether we're willing to admit it or not, men are disposable in our culture. It's for that very reason that a such a huge gap exists in college enrollment between men and women[8], 93% of work elated deaths are men[9] and the suicide rate for men is at least 3 times that of women across the board [10]. And that's just the minimum difference. [8] . https://bitly.com... [9] . http://bit.ly... [10] . http://bit.ly... We treat men as though they're disposable, as though they're tools, and despite the fact that we know men are at a disadvantage in all of these different areas the goal of mainstream gender 'equality' movements for the past hundred years have been bout benefiting women and women alone. In 2000 Dr. Warren Farrell wrote 'The Myth of Male Power'[11], in which he redefines the classical ideal of the patriarchy as vessel of female oppression. Ferrell argued that neither Men nor Women classically held 'power', as that would imply that they had the power to control what they could do with their own life. The fact is that until the past hundred years or so, men and women had to play their traditional gender roles for the sake of survival. Men would go out an do backbreaking labor which ultimately put them in very poor shape physically and health-wise, whereas women would stay in the safety of the home so that they could be healthy enough to raise children. As Ferrel writes this was not oppression of women, but a necessary social structure for mankind to survive. [11] . http://bit.ly... So What's next? The demonization of masculine values has been an element in the realm of gender equality for a while now[12]. The white ribbon campaign for instance, asserts that only men are responsible for domestic violence[13]. It claims that the traits which fuel domestic violence are inherently male traits, whereas peace is an inherently female trait. [12] . http://bit.ly... [13] . http://bit.ly...

However, this is (a) making the assumption that all atheists celebrate Christmas, and (b) does not address the problem of offending someone. If the whole benefit of saying \"Happy Holidays\" is that it presumes the person you're greeting does not believe in Jesus, but merely celebrates a holiday, then saying \"Happy holidays\" still presumes that they're celebrating a holiday of some kind. Also, Con notes that \"holiday\" can refer to \"day off\" therefore saying \"Happy Holidays\" is just a way of telling one to enjoy their day off. However, not everyone has off the holidays so again this greeting is based on the same assumptions that \"Merry Christmas\" is. Further, people say \"Happy holidays\" during the holiday season, and people do not have off all throughout the holiday season therefore this analogy isn't even completely cohesive. Moreover, if Con's argument is that people get off from work on Christmas and therefore saying \"Happy Holidays\" is appropriate, then the exact same thing can be said about saying \"Merry Christmas.\" If I say \"Merry Christmas\" to an atheist, then maybe I am simply telling them to enjoy their day off, right? Christmas is indeed celebrated on December 25th therefore saying \"Merry Christmas\" can just as easily be translated to, \"Merry day off\" by my opponent's own standards. In conclusion, I admit that saying \"Happy holidays\" includes 2 holidays more than one therefore it is logically obviously more inclusive. However, not many people in the U.S. celebrate Hanukkah or Kwanzaa anyway therefore the number of people this satisfies isn't dramatically greater. More importantly, it does not address the problem of offending non-believers which is Con's whole argument of why he supports saying \"Happy holidays\" in the first place. The phrase \"Happy holidays\" ignores non-believers, Muslims, Buddists, and a handful of other religions I mentioned and cited in R1. If \"Happy Holidays\" translates to \"Happy day off,\" the same could be said about the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" since Christmas is usually a day that people have off. That said, the reason I cited in the last round about why \"Merry Christmas\" is acceptable was (let me copy and paste to prove I addressed this) -- \"Con is is ignoring people's right to free speech. There is nothing immoral, dangerous or even explicitly rude about saying \"Merry Christmas.\" If one chooses to take offense to it, then that is their prerogative.\" Here you can see that my argument isn't that saying \"Merry Christmas\" is BETTER but that it's merely equal, so Con saying \"Happy Holidays\" is better has been negated. Further, I have explained that saying \"Merry Christmas\" shouldn't be considered taboo or politically incorrect simply because people have a right to say it, it's not offensive and it is more of a personal and genuine greeting to those who believe in Christmas.

The issue with closing all stores during Thanksgiving is that not all Americans actually celebrate Thanksgiving. This is due to a number of reasons such as immigrants may not want to celebrate a purely American custom or maybe people don't want to 'give thanks' when there is nothing worth giving thanks for. In fact, 13% of Americans say that they do not celebrate Thanksgiving [1]. While in portion to the rest of the population may not need to go to stores due to the holiday, it would be unfair to close down the entire country when 13% of the people don't celebrate the holiday. Another problem is that the origination of the Thanksgiving holiday was not so cheerful after all. In 1637 about 700 Pequot Native Americans gathered so as to celebrate their local Corn Festival. English and Dutch mercenaries surrounded the Natives and shot and clubbed as many as they could to death. The next day the Bay Colony governor called a 'Day of Thanks' because of the ruthless murder of almost 700 unarmed Native Americans. During this day of thanks the English colonists raided and kidnapped as many Native Americans as they could. On that day large numbers of ships with 500 newly captured slaves left Boston Harbor. Therefore, it is clear that Thanksgiving is neither a particularly well understood holiday as often people consider it as a long fest between Native Americans and Colonists. This is completely untrue. Thus one could argue that stores have the right to remain open due that they don't want to be forced to respect an honestly barbarous holiday.

The color gold is said to bring wealth, and the color red is considered especially lucky. The New Year's Eve dinner is very large and includes fish, noodles, and dumplings. Christmas Christmas is celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. Christmas in the United States brings together many customs from other countries and cultures. Around the world, family members help to decorate the tree and home with bright lights, wreaths, candles, holly, mistletoe, and ornaments. On Christmas Eve, many people go to church. Also on Christmas Eve, Santa comes from the North Pole in a sleigh to deliver gifts; in Hawaii, it is said he arrives by boat; in Australia, the jolly man arrives on water skis; and In Ghana, he comes out of the jungle. Eid Al Adha, the Festival of the Sacrifice Eid Al Adha is celebrated by Muslims on the 10th day of the month of the lunar calendar (In 2008, it fell on December 8) to commemorate the willingness of the prophet Ibrahim (or Abraham) to sacrifice his son for God. Today, Muslims sacrifice an animal\u2014usually a goat or a sheep\u2014as a reminder of Ibrahim's obedience to God. The meat is shared with family, friends Muslims or non-Muslims, as well as the poor members of the community. Hanukkah Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah, a holiday honoring the Maccabees victory over King Antiochus, who forbid Jews to practice their religion. For eight nights, Hanukkah is celebrated with prayer, the lighting of the menorah, and food. A menorah has nine candles, a candle for every night, plus a helper candle. Children play games, sing songs, and exchange gifts. Potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, are traditionally associated with Hanukkah and are served with applesauce and sour cream. Kwanzaa On December 26, Kwanzaa is celebrated. It is a holiday to commemorate African heritage. Kwanzaa lasts a week during which participants gather with family and friends to exchange gifts and to light a series of black, red, and green candles, which symbolize the seven basic values of African American family life that are unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. New Year's Day New Year's Day is the first day of the year in the Gregorian calendar on January 1. There are often fireworks at midnight to celebrate the new year. Commonly served in the southern part of the United States, black-eyed peas are thought to bring luck and prosperity for the new year, greens (usually collards) bring wealth, and pork because pigs root forward.

In this last round, I shall refute his assertions, expose his fallacious logic, and display what true quality is. I.The General Will This metaphysical argument stems from the ideology of Jean-Jacques Rosseau, the general will. My point remains unscathed as Con did not counter this philosophy with another, and by doing so the next violates the rules as I didn't stipulate new arguments in R4, but was available in R3. The contention still holds its might for flagging what the collective will is. Even with a mass of polarized ideas, the result will always be the general desire of the people. The philosophy states that the more diversed, the more genuine the general will is. With less people, more of special groups, and a voluntary voting system, the general will is not at its finest. Also, the sources here were bent images, inflated.Con did this many times and I shall expose this unacceptable behavior as we go on.Con said almost 1 in 5 people who did not vote said they're busy. The right figure was 18.9%, far from 20%, far from almost. There's absolutely nothing wrong with writing the exact but it was surely done for appeal. Moreover, the chance to vote shouldn't be dismissed with just an 18.9 or 3.9 figure. There are millions of us that could change the Congress and the future policies of our nation. The people's power to improve the government should be taken seriously. This strengthens our democracy and political will for change. Also, let me put an end to political pandering that had been such a problem. Pandering basically means to do what one demands even though it's not proper, good, or reasonable. When this occurs, people are sure who deserves the vote more since pandering sheds light upon the misdeeds of coercion and dishonesty. I shall refute more of their assertions herein as we go through where they are most suited. II.MV dismantles bad tactics Con asserts that my argument defeats itself because Jewish lobby groups are minorities themselves. However, Con attacks the objective and omits the subjective value, the real focal point that intrinsically links to whether they are singled out from the others in the society in which they live for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective discrimination. Therefore, the minority status is conditioned by questions of political power, not only in cold numerical. Ostensibly, in the context of my arguments, the minorities are the people who are politically weak, oppressed, unheard, and abused. The Jewish lobby groups are strong communities that have power to control running officials and influence votes. With MV, we undeniably level the playing field that constitutes equal opportunities for problematic communities. III.Voting is a civic duty Again, voting is a civic right. There are government tasks that infringe the right to freedom of speech, but is needed to support our democracy's health. One is jury duty, we are forced to do this even though it clearly violates the 5th amendment. We harm the potential condition of our nation when we leave it to the higher classes and ruling elites, Con says we don't, but we actually harm the rights of our brethren when sly tactics become available and oppressed minorities are unheard. Even one of Con's sources, the Brennan Center of Justice, states that the right to vote is the most fundamental right in an electoral democracy, which people are sometimes deprived of.[1] When we vote, we not only exercise our civic rights, but also fortify our democratic stability. IV.MV increases voters political knowledge Con attacks the CSES data because it helps political knowledge with just an \"ever so slight\" increase. This is false. The study concludes that political knowledge does accrue with age, and to deny this would deny simple, natural logic and reason. Also, the study showed that men tend to be more knowledgeable about women, but with MV enforced, the gap was fixed with the result of evenly distributed knowledge. This strongly supports the notion of General Will, women representation and equal opportunity. Moreover, Con has used my data wrongly and again proves to my favor since the study proved that strongly enforced and voluntary systems show the same correct answers, but weakly enforced systems show the leading points.[2] Still,enforcement is better than no enforcement. Moreover, MV highlights a progressive growth through time, it may be effective now, but it will be more effective then. Con failed to refute how habit grows out of tradition, which helps accrue knowledge, and is prospective in the long-run. When there's a presidential election, we are apt to get involved in social media and pour out our thoughts while acquiring some in the process. This is a natural societal stimuli during elections and is arguably hard to perturb and erase. Black propaganda will be there, but in today's time the media can easily provide what's true or not, especially when interviews are made and politicians can explain what is false or not. After the elections, things will go back to normal and the people have 6 years to know what was outrageous and remained precise; the next time there are elections, the people would know. Humans are rational beings.Once we vote, we do things rationally. Again, we may be less rational in voting now, but we will improve as we go on. ---- I.MV doesn't undermine liberty and democracy It strengthens the integrity of our government and its valued democracy. I have already explained why by not voting, we harm the future state of our nation, undermine integrity, and prolong the problems of our abused brothers and sisters. II.MV does incentivize political learning I have strongly refuted this. Accrual of knowledge will prospectively help higher voter turnout, enthusiasm, and representation. III.MV leads to better representation for the most affected MV levels the playing field no matter what happens, it eradicates targeting strategies, and pays equal opportunity for the unheard to rise up and represent themselves. This is the most heroic value of MV, its salvation. Other than that, activistic movements can be deployed with leaving the ballots blank and spoiling votes. This can be essential data for further research and study, which in turn would help better social programs and policies. Especially when it is the presidential elections, there are millions of us who can finally change the congress, the policies, and the nation's future. MV is a transformative tool, that when utilized again and again, becomes the best arsenal for political change and betterment. IV.MV doesn't punish the poor and disabled Previously in this section Con said of voters who failed to vote, about 1 in 3 said they couldn't afford to or couldn't get the day off work. The right figure was 31%, not 33.33%. Con failed to be exact and truthful, for '3 in 10' is a whole lot less from '1 in 3'. Con asserts I attack my own argument, however, it is their own argument that self-refutes.Con provides data from BPC's Democratic Project, which helps election administrators ensure that all voters who are eligible to vote can successfully participate in the democratic process.[3] Con's 14% data remains true, but it turns counter-intuitive for the source supports my argument by giving ways to assist voters with disabilities, from accessible voting machines, polling places, curbside voting options, web-interfaces for completing absentee ballots..they must incorporate available, workable solutions into the process to reduce the number of Americans who report that disability and illness keeps them away from the polls.[3] With the aforementioned, voting holidays, scheduled voting periods for the busiest businesses, and express agreements, voter turnout will increase. It is greatly essential that our people's voice is represented to ensure the uttermost integrity and honor. In conclusion, I have strongly refuted Con's fallacious and inconsiderate assertions, they remained negative and oblivious to the fact that MV helps in the most profound and sympathetic way. The metaphysics of the General Will remains powerful and unscathed, and is an infallible philosophy. We level the playing field for every eligible voter and dismantle bad tactics, uphold our civic duty, safeguard the future of nation, political knowledge and voter enthusiasm accrues with age, strengthen our integrity and democracy, represent marginalized minorities, and helps the lower class. I have successfully laid out information the most accurate way possible, while my opponent resorts to giving bent images of their statistics, and used sources that were absolutely counter-intuitive and counter-productive in their part. Thank you for a wonderful match, I hereby affirm the resolution. And may everyone cast their votes and voice in the future. [1]http://www.huffingtonpost.com... [2]http://blogs.lse.ac.uk...

Content: ok, my oponents main paoints are, 1. Columbus is a bad man so he shouldnt have a holiday 2. there is information proving that he is a bad man, and did bad things to the native Amiercans 3. he discovered America so that he could further himself, and that the discovery of the America's coud have been done by anyone. Now to counter these points i have said 1. Whether or not Columbus is bad is subjective to the person viewing him, and since our society chose to celebrate him our society has decided that his positive attribute outrule the negative 2. Columbus was merely fallowing the orders of his boss the king and queen of Spain 3. The monarchy of spain ruled that the native Americans werent people, so in Columbus's point of view keeping these people as slaves would have been no different than the way we keep pets today 4. The information saying that Columbus is a bad man is limited, historians don't have access to every single thing written about Columbus, so it isn't fair to base our opinion of a man off of the extremily limited text we have left. Keep in mind that the text we do have was written by only 3-5 different people offering only the opinions of 5 men on columbus rather than taht of that of the masses. 5.Many men do things that is socially acceptable Thomas Jefferson held slaves, and even held one as a mistress gainst her will, and after she bore his children he forced them all the continue to be slaves for him, and denied being their father so that he wouldn't have to leave them anything in his will. My opponent said what Columbus did was acceptable, however I don't understand how he could say it is acceptable for one man to do something yet unacceptable for others to do the same thing. That would be discriminatory 6. To refute my opponents argument that columbus discovered America for self gain. Ireminded him that columbus discovered America by ACCIDENT and he beleived he had found an alternate trade route to the indies until he died. And even if Columbus had actually discovered an alternate trade route he did it so that his nation could trade with Asia directly rather than have to go through the middle easterners. So if anything Columbus discovered America through wanting to better the economic situations of thousands of europeans. While his most internal motive may have been to get slaves for himself, Not only can we not know for sure unless it says in his diary \"im doing this to get slaves\" but we cannot deny there were other more philantrapic motives present. So in the end this is an argument over whether or not Chrisopher Columbus is worthy of a Holiday, The only main reason my opponent has for christopher not to receive his holiday is because he claims that christopher is responsible for numerous hanous acts. However, i have pointed out numerous times during the deabte that whether or not Christopher is a bad man or not is subjective to minds that are interperting him. Since the U.S is the only nation that celebrates Columbus day I assumed the argument was over whther they should celebrate it. Sincs the U.S has also done many hanous acts to native Americans (trail of tears, stealing of land, holding them as slaves. are just a couple) we can assume that the U.S and Christopher have a similar philosophy towards the treatment of native Americans. Due to this Christophers treatment of the indians may not be viewed by the U.S as bad, or at least not bad enough to denounce him. or else they wouldnt celebrate him. Also another point i had is that Christopher is being portrayed falsely. Note that my opponent brings up only incriminating single sided information on christopher. If we only share one half of a story anyone can look better or worse that wjho they truly are. As in my thomas jefferson example. ok im out of time so im ganna cut myself off srry. basically i was ganna recap that chris was doing orders, his acts were acceptable, and he is being mis represented", "qid": 44, "docid": "470ed1f-2019-04-18T19:34:46Z-00000-000", "score": 7.1890997886657715}, {"content": "Title: Easter needs an overhaul Content: You are saying that Easter should be moved because of the day.

Breakfast discrimination (referred to as breakfastism) leads to deterioration, not celebration.1) The Pancake's feelings would be hurt. We all know that the pancake is a delicate, sensitive food. It's fluffy, happy, and quite delicious. However, discriminating against it with a holiday for the main opponent of pancakes, waffles, would destroy its spirit. The pancake may resort to a life of crime, stealing maple syrup, sleeping in the dumpsters. The pancake would be unappreciated and unhappy. It's true, Eggo would destroy his Ego. 2) Cereal would lose its value. People value cereal. As a breakfast food, as a quick lunch, or even dinner. But does this influential powerhouse of a food get a holiday? No. The cereal industry makes a lot of income and gives a lot of jobs to American citizens. But, in the wake of the waffle crisis, cereal would no longer be as viable a candidate for breakfast.

This is clearly unsustainable. With 2.4 billion pennies made in that year, that means that the US wastes around 3.5 billion dollars every year to attempt to keep this coin relevant. 3.5 billion dollars is a lot of money, and it can't even do anything because pennies have essentially zero buying power. 2:Pennies do not function as a coin. Although they are based on the same dollar system, cards, dollars and coins typically are used on separate products. Coins are typically used on cheap, high impulse spending. For example, vending machines or parking meters. Yet, the vast majority of these products do not accept pennies. Pennies get most of their circulation by a company called Coinstar, which is a company whose sole purpose is turning left over change into more useful dollars. This means that pennies cannot function as they are designed, and should be moved out of circulation. 3:Pennies have essentially zero buying power. Among coins, coins such as the dollar coin or the quarter are circulated quickly because of the high impulse nature of coins. Pennies; however, have no buying power. For example, it takes 100 pennies to buy one dollars worth of goods. By contrast, it takes 10 dimes. The pennies lack of buying power means that they are often unused, left in a jar or other coin stash. Whenever money is not being circulated, the economy slows. This is often more important with larger tender, such as dollars or half-dollars, but pennies left unattended can quickly add, especially with billions put into circulation every year. Pennies do not function in the current economy. 4: Federal Property does not accept the penny In US military bases, the penny is already banned. There were no repercussions that were not solved by simply rounding to the nearest 5 cents instead of the nearest 1 cent. Because of this, we can see that there are in fact no detriments to the economy caused by the penny. 5: The penny is a bipartisan issue. If this was to become a reality, the only way to create such legislation would be through Congress. In the current American system, partisanship reigns supreme. Issues are debated, but bills are hardly passed, and as such, something needs to be done. The penny is an issue with supporters on both sides of them spectrum, meaning that if the bill came to Congress, there would not be a blue-red split that occurs in so much legislation. This bill could be the bridge between the two parties, meaning that an effective Congress could actually occur, all the while solving a problem that is simple to fix. Pennies are a serious issue, and the United States government needs to take care of this important and simple issue by ceasing production of the penny.", "qid": 45, "docid": "35161051-2019-04-18T12:33:43Z-00005-000", "score": 11.657099723815918}, {"content": "Title: We should get rid of the penny Content: Poll Shows Americans Concerned About Costly Price Rounding System If Penny Is Eliminated Washington, DC - A poll released today by Americans for Common Cents shows overwhelming support for the penny by the American public. The vast majority of those surveyed favored keeping the penny in circulation, a sentiment heightened when people were made aware of the penny's charitable importance, and most expressed significant concerns about higher consumer prices if the penny is eliminated. \"These results confirm the strong and unwavering support the penny continues to receive from America.\" said Weller. \"Americans understand that eliminating the penny would lead to a rounding process and cost them hundreds of millions of dollars in higher prices. Current and future generations of Americans deserve to live in a country where a penny saved truly is a penny earned.\" The poll results showed that: * Three out of four adults (73%) favor keeping the penny in circulation; * A mere 12.6% agree the penny should be removed from circulation when people are told that millions of dollars in pennies are contributed to charities each year; * 76% were concerned that if the government implements a rounding system for cash purchases, businesses might raise prices; * 69% of Americans oppose eliminating the penny and establishing a price rounding system. An analysis by Raymond Lombra, PhD, Professor of Economics at Penn State University confirms these concerns. He found that eliminating the penny would lead to a rounding of prices in America that he estimates would cost consumers more than $600 million every year. Polling results over the last eight years demonstrate the widespread support the penny enjoys with the public. Opinion Research polls in 1995 and 1996 found 73% and 76% of Americans, respectively, support the penny. A 1992 CNN/Time survey and a 1990 Gallup poll produced similar favorable results. \"Keeping the penny in circulation will avoid an inflationary rounding process and is what the American people want,\" said Weller. \"It's just common cents.\" Americans for Common Cents is a broad-based coalition of business and charitable organizations dedicated to keeping the penny. The coalition was formed in 1990 in response to Congressional threats to eliminate the one-cent coin.

Content: As part of its new budget, Canada will get rid of its penny, saving taxpayers more than C$11 million, according to the Royal Bank of Canada. Since production in 1908, the bank has produced more than 35 billion pennies, but circulation will end sometime in 2012. As part of cost cutting measures, Canada will save at least C$150 million in production and handling costs once the penny is completely abolished. It costs the Canadian government C1.6 cents to mint a penny, a coin made from copper-plated zinc and copper-plated steel. However, it won't only be the government that saves money. Banks Pay Saving pennies in a piggy bank may be fun for children, but for banks, the transportation, handling and storage of coins costs about C$20 million each year according to Canadian officials, a cost that has to be passed on to customers in the form of fees. Eliminating the penny saves a portion of the costs associated with processing coins. More Efficient Some argue that cash registers will have to be reprogrammed to accommodate the switch, but since the penny will remain in circulation until most pennies are out of circulation and taxes will continue to be calculated to the penny, cash registers and other business machines will operate as they always have. Catherine Swift, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, says that businesses welcome the change, since fewer coins will eventually make their business more efficient. Other Countries Have Done It Canada is one of many countries that have ended the minting of their lowest-value coins. In 1992, Australia eliminated their one- and two-cent coins from circulation. In January 2008, Israel eliminated their five agorot coin. These countries join at least 15 other countries including Great Britain, The Philippines, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Singapore and Mexico that have all eliminated at least one of their coins to lower government costs. When Will the United States Do It? The most notable hold out is the United States. In 2006, The Legal Tender Modernization Act was introduced by Representative Jim Kolbe. The bill aimed to require that all transactions be rounded to the nearest 5 cents but this legislation failed to pass Congress leaving the U.S. with the same problem as Canada. Producing the penny in the U.S. costs a lot more than in Canada, according to CNN. To produce a U.S. penny, the U.S. Mint pays 2.4 cents per penny, and that's up from 1.5 cents in 2006. That, along with the production of the nickel, costs the U.S. government more than $100 billion each year, and if it can't be retired, President Obama wants the cost reduced. That, according to officials, is difficult, because the administrative costs of producing a penny account for nearly half a cent, leaving very little room to cover the cost of raw materials.[1] [1]http://www.investopedia.com...

When no serious side effects came into play when the value of the dollar was higher, it is clear that it will have minimal side effects on the current economy.

(Kleptin Tourney) Content: This is a RD 1 debate for Kleptin's tournament, and I will be assuming the role of Sportsguru from the following debate: . http://www.debate.org.... Feel free to peruse it prior to reading this one. Sportsguru will, in effect, be opposing himself (or at least arguments inspired by his own). Hence, if you see chunks of text directly quoted from the above-cited debate, I'm not plagiarizing. :) I affirm, resolved: the penny should be immediately discontinued. No definitions were provided within the referenced debate, and the topic was assumed to mean that the US should stop minting pennies as a form of currency. This resolution does not require me to do anything extreme, like pull all current pennies from circulation (hence the use of \"discontinued\"). We'll stick with that interpretation. Any others would be considered extra-topical, especially in light of the purpose of this tournament. Onto case: 1. Pennies are a complete waste of critical resources. a. For all its use within the American economy (i. e. next to none), the penny is produced at a cost to the U. S. Per the group Citizens for Retiring the Penny, the U. S. Dept. of Treasury produces approximately 7 billion pennies (worth $70 million) each year. The cost to make all those pennies was around $100 million. [1] As Sportsguru predicted a year ago, this cost is only rising. ABC World News reported in 2008 that the cost of minting pennies is right around $130 million. Each penny produced costs the U. S. 1.7 cents. En total, the U. S. loses around $50 million during the penny production process. [2] Talk about ill-advised spending. In times like these, with a global recession, a U. S. economy in the throws of a depression, poor government spending, and the public quickly losing faith in the ability of its elected officials to properly money-manage, this gesture, though relatively small, would be a step in the right direction to much needed expenditure examination. It is a piece of the reform so desperately needed to encourage the economic health of the U. S. b. The transaction time in penny exchange costs the U. S. economy further. Though we don't often consider the time costs of a monetary exchange involving pennies (or change, for that matter), we should. Efficiency is a primary concern of a struggling economy, and any step toward improving efficiency while maintaining a just system should be taken. The National Association of Convenience Stores as well as the Walgreen's drug stores assert that transactions involving pennies waste approximately 2-2.5 seconds per cash transaction. That may seem like a pittance , but the resulting wasted time is exponentially terrible when considered on a national scale. I won't bore the readers with the calculus here, suffice to say that each American wastes around 2.5 hours every year on penny transactions. This would be mirrored in all consumer industries that take pennies within their transactions. If we then calculate the opportunity cost per person in the U. S. (i. e. what that 2.5 hours means in dollars in terms of salary), each person in the U. S. \"pays\" the government around $30-$40 just to keep pennies in circulation. Granted, some of that can be factored into the original production cost of $150 million (through taxes), but considering that the opportunity cost adds up to closer to $10 billion per year for the nation, pennies cost much more to keep in circulation than their production value. Though this $10 billion may seem like a tiny drop in the heaving, \"perfect-storm-esque\" sea that is the national debt, imagine the programs that can be funded on that money each year. 2. Increasing out dependence on China (and other foreign countries) is detrimental to both the domestic and foreign interests of the U. S. As is well known, China currently possesses the highest concentration of utilized zinc resources in the world. [3] Furthermore, they are actively trying to corner the market on this particular resource. Just this year, Chinese zinc giant Metallurgical Corp of China is seeking to bid on Anglo-American Zinc, worth approximately $1 billion. [4] If this acquisition is completed (which it likely will be), China would successfully purchase a huge chunk of the American industrial market, which is crucial because the US currently has the second highest concentration of zinc resources in the world. But, you might ask, why don't we just produce the zinc ourselves? Easy answer: we import because companies like Anglo-American can't undersell our foreign competitors. This is evident at the sale of Anglo-American. What's worse, it appears that Anglo-American will be controlled by a country other than the U. S. The other major bidders are all out of the country. We are already far too indebted to other nations, especially China, to be able to operate freely within the world economy. These expenditures further damage our political capital, as we appear weak and unable to control our domestic affairs. Furthermore, as is clearly illustrated by the U. S. political lobby system, indebtedness translates directly into policy compromises. Considering China's current state of affairs, do we really want to compromise influence that we might have over, say, their human rights abuses? In conclusion, for the good of the nation and its citizens, I strongly urge a vote in favor of eliminating the penny. [1] . http://www.retirethepenny.org... [2] . http://abcnews.go.com...

Content: Today, pennies have become little more than a nuisance to our economy and therefore should be eliminated. In the Harris Poll, an online, nationwide poll that surveyed 2,136 adults, a total of 59% of those adults were opposed to the abolishing of the penny. The first of two main reasons people believed that the penny should remain in circulation was that the pennies served as a historical memorial to a particularly beloved president, Abraham Lincoln. In 21 December 2005, President Bush signed into law legislation directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue newly designed reverse side images to mark the 200th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. As Mark Bishop, the executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, praised, many people believe that \"the penny is perhaps the most visible and tangible reminder of Lincoln's significance in American History.\" The second reason was, as claimed by Mark W. Weller, the Executive director of Americans for Common Cents, \"the fact that the penny remains popular with the public and important to our pricing system.\" He also claimed that the statement that the \"'U.S. is among the last industrialized nations to abolish' its low denomination coin runs counter to the facts. The European Union's adoption of the euro included a one-cent euro coin or 'euro penny. [...] And in the major industrialized countries, including Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and the U.S., the penny or penny-equivalent remains in production and shares similar percentages of total coins produced into those countries. However, they are wrong. The benefits of keeping pennies are overwhelmed by the consequences of keeping them. The claim that the penny is an important memorial to President Lincoln is clearly fallacious. The 16th president of the United States who maintained the Union and thereby abolished slavery by winning the Civil War, a war that made the ratification of the 13th Amendment immediately available, is memorialized enough as it is. He is already apparent on the five dollar bill (who would want to be remembered on a coin that according to William Saffire of the New York Times, \"two thirds of the time immediately drop out of circulation behind sofas, drawers, etc when he or she is already on a five dollar bill; how many of those have you seen lying on the ground). Also, he has an entire memorial of him in Washington. A 99 foot marble statue of him that cost $3 million to make. Why should we in our poor economic situation today print these pennies that obviously are trivial to the accolade of Lincoln when according to MIT graduate Jeff Gore in Ric Kahn's article \"Penny Pinchers\" for The Globe, \"the presence of pennies wastes (3 transactions/day) x (2.25 seconds/transaction) x (3 people per transaction) = 20 seconds per day. [...] it translates to 40 x 365 / 3600 - 4 hours per person per year. [...] each person is losing $60 per year, at a cost to the nation of over $15 billion per year.\" not to mention that the cost to making a penny costs approximately 1.6 cents? Moving on, the claim by Mark Weller, however, is not credible. In his unpublished letter to William Saffire to argue that the coin was valuable, he, as previously stated, believed the pennies to be \"important to our pricing system.\" Not only does the reader have to question his claim as he provides no factual evidence to support his claim but the reader has to realize that this man is speaking on bias. He is the Executive director of an organization that supports the coin. He is wealth is corner stoned on the fact that the penny exists. There is no escaping economic history: it takes nearly a dime to buy what a penny bought back in 1950. Pennies are losing value and face. The United States has no use for them. As William Saffire comically remarked, \" the Brits and the French - even the French! - who dumped their low-denomination coins 30 years ago, will be laughing at our senseless jingle\" The penny, hardly anything more than a inconsequential memorial to such a great president, should be eliminated. They are acting as a retardant to our American economy.

Because the US makes billions of these per year the costs add up. In 2014, around 8,146,400,000 new pennies were made that year. Take the cost and multiply it by the amount of new pennies circulated in 2014 and you get 57 million dollars wasted every year to keep alive this dead currency. That is money that could be used for better things. Even if the cost of pennies were reduced if they were made of something that represents their true nature like plastic, this does not solve the fundamental problem with pennies. Argument 2: Pennies fail as currency Let me build a scenario, you want stuff from a shop keeper. Rather than bartering like savages, you use money as a means of exchange. That is what money is meant to do. Money is used as means to facilitate the transaction of goods. Pennies fail to meet this function that because they are very inconvenient to use. For example, try to pay for $10 worth of groceries with 1000 pennies in your pocket. Even if you just pay in exact change pennies still prove an inconvenience. When you get to the counter and fumble with getting the right amount of pennies, you waste other people\"s time. Pennies not only make transaction of goods more frustrating and inconvenient but in many cases, they also fail as a mean of transacting goods. Say you rather not waste people\"s time and go to a machine to take your pennies and return a good or service. However such machines are virtually nonexistent. Toll booths don\"t accept them, vending machines don\"t accept them, parking meters, laundry machines, or anything else because they aren\"t worth the time and effort to count, transport, and store them. The only machine that exists today that accepts pennies is Coin Star. It is but a leech on the economy that takes 10% of your hard earned cash and returns 90% of money that you should already be able to use. Back then, pennies could actually buy things, but the rising cost of pennies and inflation ultimately makes pennies a useless currency and the reason why most pennies end up in jars. Conclusion: Because of the cost of the US penny and the fact that it fails to facilitate the transaction of goods, we should move on and abandon the penny.

C1) While individually pennies are not worth much, over time they add up. A) In 2002, Gallup polling found that 58 percent of Americans stash pennies in piggy banks, jars, drawers and the like, instead of spending them like other coins. Some people eventually redeem them at banks or coin-counting machines! So many Americans actually do use the penny. B) Furthermore, the penny is used to raise money by charity organizations. People who would not be willing to part with a larger bill are often willing to give up Pennies. The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society has raised 150 million dollars through its \"Pennies for Patients\" program over 15 years. Without the penny, this cancer research would not have been possible. C2) Pennies help fight inflation \"We think the penny is important as a hedge to inflation,\" says director Mark Weller of Americans for Common Cents. \"Any time you have more accurate pricing, consumers benefit.\" Small business owners and small purchases rely on the penny. Loss of the penny will create inflation and price instability. http://www.offthekuff.com... C3) The rise of credit cards defeats the purpose of rounding coins. The common complaint about pennies is that they are inefficient to use. Credit cards however operate by computer. They can handle as many digits as needed. As credit cards become more common, pennies will be used less. So these disadvantages become less noticeable. Onto my opponents case \"But, in the case of nickels and pennies, the government lost almost $100 million dollars alone in 2007.\" First, I would like to point out my opponent provided no sources for this claim(or any claim he makes). The argument should be discredited on that basis alone. Second, the federal government has a budget of three trillion a year. 100 Million dollars would be .0003 percent of the yearly budget. This would have a virtually unnoticeable effect on the budget (It would save everyone money in the pennies, which as my opponent has abolished would result in no benefit for most tax payers). This is significantly outweighed by the extra money a 99 cent purchase would now cost (1 percent). http://www.wallstats.com... \"So, a simple remedy is to stop minting the Jefferson nickel, and make the Lincoln penny worth five cents\" This part of my opponents case would have a significant negative impact on the economy. Suddenly, every penny a person owns would quintuple in value. The amount of money in the US economy would change. Assuming Congress was even considering passing this bill, there would be a mad dash by consumers to acquire as many pennies as they can. This would create much instability in the market place.

This is because the raw minerals of the penny exceeded the one cent which the penny itself is worth. This problem has only been worsened, and in 2011 it cost the US Mint 2.4 cents to produce a one-cent-penny[1]. This means that every year, with the US Mint producing 4.3 billion pennies[1], the United States is spending $100 million on $43 million worth of pennies, effectively donating $57 to no one every year. With the penny costing us more than it is worth, then we should not produce it anymore.Opportunity CostWe've all heard that age old saying \"Time is money\", well it turns out that this old saying in fact has a fancy term in economics: opportunity cost. As defined by the New Oxford American Dictionary: \"(Opportunity cost is) the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.\"[2]. As I will demonstrate, the handling of a penny is a form of opportunity cost Before I make my argument I must make this point clear: it doesn't matter what people handling pennies would have done otherwise, only that they spend it doing something not worth their time in the first place, because in economics, time really is money, and their time is worth more than thatThe median wage in the United States is $17 per hour[3]. This means that it takes the average person two seconds to earn one cent, and as such it is not worth one's time. Even if it takes only four seconds to handle a penny, that means that two seconds are wasted in terms of productivity in terms of the handling of pennies. This is equivalent to losing $1 billion each year in productivity[4]. Another economist, Robert Whalpes, has estimated the opportunity cost of penny production at $300 million[5]. Regardless of which of these figures is correct, the underlying problem remains, which is that the very existence of pennies, costs the US people money, and lots of it. Abolishing the penny would solve this problem.Pennies Are UselessThe purpose of money is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. Pennies do not serve this purpose.Pennies are not usually accepted in bulk, only being used to give people exact change, and as demonstrated, this exact change is not even worth its opportunity cost. If one wished to avoid these problems of opportunity cost to other people waiting in line to pay for their goods and services, then they would have to use a machine: none of which, except Coinstar, accept them. As a result of this, most pennies just end up in glass jars out of circulation. To quote Greg Mankiw, a Professor of Macroeconomics at Harvard University: \"The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange, but... the penny no longer serves that purpose\"[6]. When a coin fails to fulfil its purpose, it is time to get rid of it.ConclusionI have provided three arguments: the penny costs more than it is worth, it provides a significant opportunity cost, and it fails to fulfil its purpose as money. All of these arguments stand. As such, the resolution is affirmed.Sources1: http://tinyurl.com...2: http://tinyurl.com...;3: http://tinyurl.com...;4: http://tinyurl.com...;5: http://tinyurl.com...6: http://tinyurl.com...", "qid": 45, "docid": "ce686c60-2019-04-18T17:24:46Z-00004-000", "score": 9.40060043334961}, {"content": "Title: Stop the Minting of the American Penny Content: Yea sorry about the mishap. Thanks for being understanding though. That being said, this will be my last round for arguments, so I will respond to the Pro side\u2019s last post and provide more clarity on my position. Section 1: The Penny has an Economic Impact in Industry, and Industry Tries to Help. In my last round, I reported that if the penny suddenly stopped being produced, that there would be a significant impact in the zinc industry that could cause large contracts with the government to be essentially voided. One such contract is with Jarden Zinc Products[1][2], who currently have contracts worth millions with the government to produce such pennies, and such voiding of coins for production would significantly have an impact on this industry. These companies don\u2019t try and stifle the American government either, as such industry uses modern technology to reduce the cost of the manufacturing. Multi-ply plating technology is now used to reduce cost when compared to through alloy coins, and makes these coins possess a unique electro magnetic signature (EMS) which provides for greater coin security.[1] So yes I see the Pro\u2019s side in that robotics can help manufacture durables (or pennies for this debate) cheaper, and that\u2019s great, but against Pro\u2019s argument, you don\u2019t see people abolishing the car\u2026. Or milk. It takes people to come up with such testing and technologies to try and achieve ideas to manufacture better, so yes this is not only jobs being lost, but innovation as well. Section 2: Financial Impact of the Penny\u2019s Absence If the penny were to cease production, there would be many undesired consequences from this action that would be counter-intuitive from the Pro side, but would quickly become devastating realities for the general public. Intrinsically, if the penny were to be removed from production, there could be no way to sustain prices realistically without rounding to the nearest 5 cent piece. Millions of transactions are managed every day in the United States, and with 28% of Americans either not owning a savings/checking account, or trusting on payday lending services[3]. With this data, the amount of cash/coin trades each day is purely not dismissible, not withstanding that cash is used in 46% of all transactions in the U.S[4]. Demographics with comparatively low incomes (predominantly the young, elderly, and minorities) use cash more commonly than people with higher incomes. Because only cash dealings will be subject to rounding, any move to eradicate the penny would be regressive and hurt these demographics of Americans who have no other choice and do not possess the means to make non-cash transactions. According to one report[5], the Treasury would essentially lose money without the penny. First, the Mint's construction and circulation costs include fixed elements that will continue to be incurred whether or not the Mint manufactures the penny. The report approximates this fixed component at $13 million (2011). In addition, there is $17.7 million in operating costs apportioned to the penny that would have to be engrossed by the remaining denominations of circulating coins without the penny. Moreover, under present Mint accounting, the nickel expenses eleven cents to produce (and the nickel isn\u2019t even being targeted in this debate). In a scenario where nickel manufacturing doubled without the penny, the study determines that with current fixed costs, abolishing the penny would prospectively result in increased net costs to the Mint of $10.9 million, compared to the current state of manufacturing. Section 3: Proposed Solutions As I previously stated, there are better ways to resolve this debate, and the best way is to make the penny worth 1 cent again. In 1982, the United States changed the composition of the penny to reduce manufacturing costs, and such similar solutions can be found again in contemporary times, ending an outdated 30-year solution. An option that could sustain such reduction is costs calls for a core of some sort of ceramic material, with similar heft as zinc[6]. Ceramics are metal-based and consequently much denser than plastic, though not as heavy as metal itself. Ceramics could be made from 2 inexpensive compounds: silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3, or possibly with a bit of denser oxide such as titanium oxide added for weight. The ceramic penny core likely could be anodized with a copper skin fairly cheapl, thus no longer requiring the use of zinc to manufacture our pennies. Section 4: Current Trends Over the past couple years, the prices of the metals needed to produce the modern penny have actually decreased. According to a report from the Department of Treasury[a], after attaining a peak cost of 2.41 cents in 2011 due to the substantial growth in global metal prices, the cost of manufacturing has dropped to 1.83 cents for 2013.[4] In the 2014 fiscal year, the cost to yield a penny fell additionally to 1.70 cents.Congressman Steve Stivers (R-OH) has introduced a bi-partisan bill to mandate the use of steel in the manufacturing of pennies, dimes, and nickels. . Research has shown this bill could save the U.S. government up to $2 billion in material costs over a 10 years. References: [1]: http://www.export.gov...

Content: Okay after a long hiatus, I am back again and ready to rumble. I must unfortunately begin with the almost obligatory request that voters vote for whom did the better debating rather than with whom you agree with. With that out of the way I will first present my case before moving on to my opponent's. 1. Direct waste of money According to Citizens for Retiring the Penny (http://www.retirethepenny.org...) , the U.S. Mint produces about 7 billion pennies ($70 million) every year at a cost over $100 million. Thus, we directly lose at least $30 million a year producing the penny. And with the rising cost of zinc, that deficit will only grow. 2. Waste of time (= indirect waste of money) The National Association of Convenience Stores and Walgreen's drug stores estimated that pennies waste 2 to 2.5 seconds per each cash transaction. If we estimate that each person goes through two of these transactions per day (which seems rather low) and that on average there is one person waiting in line (which once again seems low). This makes for 3 persons' time to be wasted (cashier, penny finder, person in line). We can then calculate that the presence of pennies wastes (2 transactions/day) X (2 seconds/transaction) X (3 people per transaction) = 12 seconds per day, or 1.2 hours per person per year. Of course, when you get home you still have to find something to do with your pennies, meaning that probably only about half of the wasted time is directly connected with a cash transaction (the other time is associated with counting pennies etc), giving a total of 2.4 wasted hours per person per year. The mean wage in the US is approximately $17/hour, implying that each of us is effectively \"paying\" $40 per year to keep pennies in circulation. Given that the US has ~ 240 million adults, using pennies is currently costing the nation $10 billion per year. Thus, the penny costs us $10,030,000 per year. While this may seem small compared to the total national debt, every little bit helps. In fact, if no cost cutting measures were taken other than retiring the penny, the current debt would be erased in 959,619 years! 3. China dependence The reason for influx of the price make pennies is the main ingredient: zinc. And guess who is the world's largest exporter of zinc\u2026 you guessed it: China! With every penny we make, we further increase our economic dependency on China. So retiring the penny would also make our economy more independent. Now to my opponent: My opponent has one argument: that the nostalgic value of the penny cannot be ignored, comparing it to various monuments in D.C. I will contend the actual nostalgic value in a second but first we must see that keeping the penny could in fact result in the end of it. As I have shown, we are losing tremendous amounts of money due to the penny. This annual loss helps push our economy helping to lead to a recession or a depression. When you have depression, countries are in danger of breaking apart. If the U.S. were to cease to exist so would the penny, so either way we lose any nostalgic value. Now I contend that there is no value to the penny. Considering that 58% of people save pennies rather than spend them, the new penny philosophy seems to be the one found in this Ashfield comic: http://www.ashfieldonline.com... rather than the one my opponent is indicating. As I have shown why the penny should be discontinued I bid adieu until my opponent responds.", "qid": 45, "docid": "64d27e41-2019-04-18T19:38:48Z-00004-000", "score": 9.280200004577637}, {"content": "Title: Stop the Minting of the American Penny Content: Thanks to con for relinquishing the last round, and for joining me in this debate.If we look at con's fifth source, which s/he used to stress his/her belief that the US will lose money, we see in exactness why Rodney Bosco, the author of the article, believes this to be the case. Mr. Bosco states that getting rid of the penny, a coin produced with money lost as a result, would \"...increase demand for the nickel, which is also currently produced at a loss\" (p.2). While this is true, simply keeping the penny and changing the contents of it would not be an adequate measure. Perhaps changing the nickel's contents, a coin that has ten times the buying power of the penny, would be (or we could get rid of it too, but that's for another debate, I suppose). Even using the multi-ply plating technology would not be enough. To stress this point, Bosco said that such technology has \"...been successfully used by the RCM to manage circulating coinage for Canada...\"(p.3) - a country that even with this method got rid of their penny three years ago as of this May. I must stress that the penny's content is something that can be changed, but is not worth changing when considering how low its buying power is.As for the argument \"you don\u2019t see people abolishing the car\u2026. Or milk,\" I don't see this as a perfect comparison. Cars provide fast and effective transportation, and milk has nutritional value. Pennies, on the other hand, don't provide the services that they should. Even the argument pertaining to those who use cash to pay for things doesn't have much basis, and I'll explain why: the part about rounding up goes against what I've already said about the myth of the \"rounding tax\" back in Round 2. Most places that have gotten rid of the penny round both up and down, and it's worth mentioning that no significant effect has been shown to the economy and there has been no significant or noticeable rise in prices nor, for that matter, has there been any decrease in charitable donations [1]. It is also worth mentioning that people who are poorer and would use money more are statistically more likely to donate money to charity.Finally, I would like to say that the amount of money earned back from reforming the penny does not reach how much we have lost, as attested by my argument in Round 2.I thank con again for joining me in this debate.

Vending machines, toll booths, laundromats, and pay phones will spit them out or even sound an alarm. Many people simply place their pennies in a jar, or a 5-gallon water jug. \" This only concedes to the idea that the penny allows for charity organizations to make more money. Since few places do not take the penny, it now becomes easier for an individual to donate more penny than any other coin due to face value. \"I agree with my opponent that the penny does serve towards patriotism but the fact that our economy is losing more money than necessary in this poor economy is a sure indicator that money should be treated as money.

Since the penny is of sentimental value, then the penny is of benefit to the public mind which then protects it from being eliminated. \"Many people believe that eliminating the penny would, in fact, harm the amount of money spent towards charities.

If you were to eliminate every penny in the making, giving up the nickel would be even harder because the nickel can now be seen as the only way to complete a purchase (all item will now be rounded to the nearest 5 cents). \"ake a hundred people giving a donation of a penny.

If my calculations are correct, JC PENNY's Penny Drive would have made $2,753,135.87 asking for a nickel. \" If 84 people give a nickel to the charity organization, then it is also likely that 8400 people would give the penny. Since the penny has a lesser face value, more people are likely to give the penny than nickel. {please give me your evidence for the JC penny claim} \"Economics Professor Ray Lombra may have believed that most prices would have been rounded up but a Washington Post article says otherwise. \"Robert M. Whaples of Wake Forest University has analyzed 200,000 transactions across seven states, and he concluded that consumers would not actually suffer. Purchases at gas stations and convenience stores are just as likely to come to $7.02 as $6.98, so the rounding up and rounding down would cancel themselves out. On average, shoppers would lose nothing. \" Statistically, there would be no loss of money by rounding. \" If this was actually true, the the economy in general would suffer. The first scenario stated by my opponent says that an Item worth $7:02 would be rounded to %6.98. If this business normally makes 3,000 sales, that is a loss of $1,500. This hurts the owner as there business is now losing money and this also hurts the circle of selling and buying, which then hurts the economy in general. \"My question to weirdman would be why more production of the nickel be necessary. It would take four pennies to pay any $0. X4 (X representing any positive integer less than 10) but one would technically only need one nickel at most to to pay for any $0. X5. Also, utilizing the time to figure out the exact change of these prices would be worth it. \" A greater production of nickel will have to take place because with the penny gone, the nickel would have to become the lowest denomination and thus a greater need for the nickel to complete a pay would take place which means a greater production would need to take place to maintain stability.

My opponent forgot to mention the part where I stated, \"If it is of no benefit. .. not facilitating exchange. \" Now, as I said I would explain further above, eliminating the penny is not equivalent to abolishing the American Flag because whereas the American Flag's purpose is to serve as a \"symbolic of nationhood and identity,\"[1] the true purpose of the penny or any money in general is to \"function as a medium of exchange when it is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services. This function facilitates and eliminates the inefficiencies of a barter system, where goods and services are directly exchange for other goods and services.

My opponent has no justification as to why 8400 people donating a penny could be as likely as 84 people donating a nickel but I do for my calculations. Take situation A where donors only donate pennies and situation B where donors only donate nickels. As previously stated by my opponent himself, 15.5% of American people are of the lower class and would have trouble donating a single nickel (which I personally find difficult to believe unless those individuals had absolutely no idea of the severity of poverty around the world. Most of America's homeless are better off thank some average people of third world countries. ) and so mathematically speaking, 100% - 15.5% = 84.5% would be able to donate a nickel. For the sake of easy math, let's say that situation A has 1000 donors all capable of donating a penny. However, since situation B donors are donating nickels, we must take into consideration the lower class who are reluctant to give that nickel. Therefore, situation A would have 1000 people whereas situation B would only have 845 people. Situation A would make 1000 x $0.01 = $10. Yet, Situation B would make 845 x $0.05 = $42.25. So mathematically, asking for a nickel would not only be more profitable but also it would help the mission of the charities which my opponent was concerned about. Evidence for the JC PENNY claim: >($655508.54 asking for pennies) x (84.5% of people rather than the complete 100%) x (5 as that is the amount of times a nickel is worth over a penny) = $2,769,523.58 The price here comes out to be more because above, I approximated 84.5% to 84 in favor of my opponent because there is no such thing as .5 of a person. However, this time I took into consideration 1000 people providing a more accurate result. My opponent misunderstood my claim that \"$7.02 as $6.98\" would be just as likely. It is saying that the probability of an item costing $7.02 would be the same as an item costing $6.98 and therefore would both round to $7.00 cancelling each other out. Nowhere did I mention a percentage of 6.98% or if my opponent made a mistake typing the dollar sign, if he read more carefully, he would see that I never stated that an item would round down to $6.98. The fact that a business normally makes 3,000 sales makes the statistical probability of rounded prices cancelling each other greater and more ideal. My opponent misunderstood my question to him. The only way you could pay for something worth $0.04 or $0.07 (two of four prices that would round up or down to $0.05) would be with 4 pennies or 1 nickel and 2 pennies whereas $0.05 would only take one nickel. There would be more hassle. Similarly, that can be said about any value whether it be $0.84 or $0.87 compared to $0.85. My claim is that, paying for any price would only require at most, 1 nickel (because of the existence of dimes and quarters) whereas a with pennies, the most would be 4. Also, as I mentioned above, taking the time to add up the correct change with these coins would be worth it because of their larger face value. So I ask again, why would production of the nickel be necessary? Ultimately, I believe the penny should be eliminated because it does not serve its purpose as a monetary medium. If you had a Engineer who was bad at engineering but a great artist, wouldn't you move him to the art department? Similarly, if a penny is a poor monetary system, it should go where it belongs: in a museum. I thank my opponent for willing to debate with me in my first debate. I thank every one of you who took time to read through our debate. And have a very merry Christmas. Sources:[1] . http://www.tpk.govt.nz...

Sentimental Value: When looking into the issue of sentimental value, we find that it is one of major concern to the American citizen. The best way to understand the value of the cent towards the American population, is to look at the penny or rather cent's history. BACKGROUND: \"When the United States Mint was created in 1792, one of the first coins it made the following year was the one-cent coin, and it looked very different from the modern version. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The image on the first cent was of a lady with flowing hair, who symbolized liberty. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The coin was larger and made of pure copper, while today's smaller cent is made of copper and zinc. In 1857, Congress authorized the United States Mint to strike the cent with 88 percent copper and 12 percent nickel. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The \"shape and size\" would be determined by the United States Mint Director, with the approval of the Treasury Secretary. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The new cents showed a flying eagle on the front and a wreath on the back. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The act of February 21, 1857, also mandated that people could no longer use coins from other countries, a practice that had been necessary because of a lack of domestic coinage. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd However, people could bring their foreign coins to the United States Mint, where they could be exchanged for U. S. silver coins and the new cents. From 1909 to 1958, the Lincoln obverse was paired with a reverse that featured a wheat design in which two sheaves of wheat flanked the words\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdONE CENT\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUNITED STATES OF AMERICA. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd It is commonly known as the \"wheat penny. \" From 1959 to 2008, the reverse featured an image of the Lincoln Memorial designed by Frank Gasparro. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd It commemorated the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth. In 2009, the United States Mint issued four different one-cent coins in recognition of the bicentennial of President Abraham Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the first issuance of the Lincoln cent. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The themes for the reverse designs represent the four major aspects of President Lincoln's life: birth and early childhood in Kentucky (1809-1816) formative years in Indiana (1816-1830) professional Life in Illinois (1830-1861) presidency in Washington, DC (1861-1865)\" {1} With this being said, we can clearly see that the penny seen as one of the first American formulated coins, possess a both patriotic as well as personal value. On to statistics: Results of the poll, conducted by Opinion Research Corporation (ORC), show that: * 69% of Americans favor keeping the penny in circulation, which is virtually identical to what Americans reported (71%) to ORC in 2001; * 64% of respondents oppose eliminating the penny and establishing a price rounding system; and * 70% expressed concern that if the government implements rounding schemes for cash purchases, merchants might take the opportunity to raise prices rather than lose pennies when rounding down, with minority Americans expressing most concern. {2} A personal survey interviewing 50 of my school mates showed these results: 38--->Wanted to keep the penny 10---> Didn't care 2-----> Wanted the penny gone. We must also take in consideration that many charities use the penny to collect huge amount of donation. Take the JC PENNY Penny drive, the penny to many is far easier to donate than coins with a higher face value. Abolishing the penny will greatly affect these charity organizations as the are now unable to collect as much money as they previously did with the existence of the penny. \"Some charities use penny drives to raise money. Children in New York City collected more than 65 million pennies last year for a total of $655,508.54, according to organizer Common Cents. \"It is a very powerful symbol of the potential we have to turn our wasteful society into a caring and recycling and reciprocal society,\" Common Cents founder Teddy Gross says. \" {3} Both the statistic and the survey above shows that the penny is worth a lot when it comes to the American population. The American citizen not only see the sentimental worth of a penny, they also recognizes its. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Economic worth. My opponent makes a valuable point in stating that the penny is worth far more than its face value, however we must also take in consideration that the penny is also a major part of the economic circle. If the penny was abolished, every American goods as well as imported goods will have to be rinses to the nearest nickel. This might not seen like a lot, but to the lower class which makes up approximately 15.5% of the American population. \"And at least one economist says eliminating the penny would hurt the poor. When prices are rounded, most of the amounts will be rounded up, not down, argues Pennsylvania State University economics professor Ray Lombra, who has testified before Congress in support of the penny. For those who have little money, those pennies will add up. \"Certainly the working poor \u2014 many of them still do not have checking accounts, credit cards \u2014 they are conducting their transactions in cash. So they are the ones who are going to bear most of the burden,\" Lombra says. \" {3} We must also look into the fact that the nickel cost far more than the current penny. The nickel cost $7.55 approximately $2.55 over its face value. If the penny was to be eliminated, there would be an increase in the manufacturing of nickels which in turn would cost the united states more money than both the current penny and nickel production today. Following my opponents core reason to abolish the penny, we should also abolish the nickel as it cost more to produce than it is actually worth.

My opponent argues that pennies stay in currency a long time, making it worth the 1.8 Pennies it costs. We'll just because it stays in currency longer does not make it more valuable. I honestly don't see how that would make anything more valuable. My argument last round (sorry for the confusion) was that even if we had to make five dollar bills 25 times more often it would still be more cost effective then the penny. Simply because It cost practically nothing to make paper but copper costs a decent amount of money, and to top it all off the five dollar bill is worth about 500 times more valuable then the penny. 2. The penny has no buying power but is used in currency quite a bit. But for what reason? Somebody might say to make exact change but eventually the money used to make this change is simply not worth it. My opponent has made no argument against this statement. 3. Our money system is cent based but for what reason? As I said there is almost no value at all to this coin, so why do we pay exact change? The reason is non-existent, the penny is such a small increment that it can't be efficiently used in a transaction requiring more then ten cents, which can't really be used to buy anything at all. The penny can have value if you take a redicolus time collecting them but so can any coin or any other increment of money. You cold still spend the pennies, there just simply wouldn't be any new ones coming in. Though company's will still round to the nearest 5\" eventually. My opponent argues that the penny might gain value but that that claim is 100% false. Inflation will occur until the government stops borrowing and lending money which pretty much means its never going to stop. And if it were it would happen in at least 20+ years, even if inflation stopped now the penny is still not worth it. 1. Many people including my opponent think that rounding to the nearest 5\" would hurt the econemy but its like a game of chance, since the money can be rounded up or down, the overall price over a year would be roughly the same, but again even it was rounded up every single time (which it won't) we would loose an extra 50$ tops in an entire year. 2. I think it's simply the fact that people are very greedy. I think you have conceded this argument but I'm not sure.... So just to recap theses charities won't loose money because people would have to give nickel which would actually probably boost charity income. 3. Well umm... Yeah not really an argument. Summary: Pennies are bad for the econemy because the government literally spends money to make less money and then people are taxed to make up for it. Pennies can't be used to buy anything and are practically useless. The only thing pennies are good for is making exact change but after a while the value the money represents becomes to small to buy anything or bother with. When peope take out pennies to make exact change it just wastes the people's time that are in the line, in is a just a plain out inconvenice we have to pay for with tax dollars.

The stock on zinc (not copper as pennies are primarily zinc) has risen in the last five years and is currently rising. . https://www.google.com... How do you think that the pennies usefulness outweighs its cost? Charities It looks like you are the one dancing to this one. First my statement can be proved and is not contradictory. The quote was: \"The penny is the most donated coin,yet it can be quickly overshadowed by the nickel (5-1)\" The meaning was clear, a nickel is worth five pennies, a donation of one nickel will always beat a donation of four pennies. (proof) You on the other hand have no proof, You again assume that people will not donate nickel's or will be stingy. As I outlined in round two assumptions like this make charitable people look bad. Australia is another country who abolished the penny way back in 1992. The charitable donations still rose even though they has no pennies to give. . http://www.jbwere.com.au... I am Canadian I believe that I have the right to use the international experiences of the loss of the penny in a debate. Using countries comparable to the USA is is a great way to estimate what will happen to the economy after the abolishing. I do know that the Canadian economy is not the exact same. I also know my fair share about the American economy. The reason I do not compare America to America is because no matter which America you compare it to they still have their penny. Furthermore I have only given examples of my own experiences with the penny being abolished effect on commerce (I can use other Canadian or Australian examples if you wish) and gave an idea for charities. I did use other arguments outside of Canada. Burden As stated I believe this burden is the instigators. You have only given ONE clear argument which was refuted twice. In reply to your points they can be tackled quite easy to what I have said earlier and what is assumed when starting a debate: 1) Removing the penny is justified: It costs too much to make and is not worth it. What other follow through do you need? 2) Will not harm the economy: I have stated that it will help the economy by decreasing debt and will not do any harm with a complete rounding system. 3) The plan to phase out pennies: oh I assumed you knew, it is your argument. Getting rid of pennies will be done the only way that makes sense, phasing them out from circulation. Here is the normal process used by Australia and Canada (Yes, most likely USA): Stop minting the penny (the process of making the penny), merchants will stop giving out pennies as change but will accept them for a period of time, (if you have exact change as a customer you don't round up or down), the banks end up with the pennies and then they are re-purposed by the government. The only other way to take pennies out of the system is to make pennies worthless, not legal tender. This wont happen for obvious reasons. Other arguments to refute: Pennies are a waste of time and time is money. Many people don't bother to take their pennies as change let alone spend them in stores. The people that do spend pennies end up wasting everyone time. \"National Association of Convenience Stores and the Walgreen's drugstore chain have estimated that handling pennies adds 2 to 2.5 seconds per cash transaction. Assume that the average citizen makes one such transaction every day, and so wastes (to be conservative) 730 seconds a year. The median worker earns just over $36,000 a year, or about 0.5 cents per second, so futzing with pennies costs him $3.65 annually. \" . http://www.washingtonpost.com... This estimate does not include the time wasted from picking up found pennies, the cashier or business time wasted by customers counting pennies, the cashiers time wasted by counting pennies at end of shift, rolling your pennies because you have so many, and taking pennies to the bank to be changed. Pennies are not accepted for all purchases. Electronic transactions are becoming more and more common and the penny is becoming less useful in that respect. Vending machines, phone booths, toll booths, and parking meters are some examples of electronic merchants that do not accept pennies. Pennies are bad for the environment. It is no secret that many pennies end up just dropped, you can find them on the streets and in the sewers. Unlike that banana peel rotting on someone's lawn pennies do not biodegrade efficiently. What is worse for the environment are the mines, Specifically zinc mines (Pennies are made of very little copper) \"Red Dog Mine, which is the largest zinc mine in the U. S. is by far the #1 polluter on the EPA's list, because of large quantities of heavy-metal and lead rich mining tailing's. The process of refining both metals can release sulfur dioxide (SO2), lead and zinc into the environment. \" . http://www.treehugger.com... In conclusion, It is obvious that taking out the penny will result in a better future for the USA, financial and otherwise. Because of Con's constant assumptions, a single outdated, uneducated argument, and inability to create a rebuttal it is clear that Pro is the front runner in this debate.

Firstly, I will refute, weigh the significance of controversial arguments, address the burden, and, finally, conclude. Refutations to Refutations: Refutation 1: Rounding My opponent has brought up in their refutation to my argument about economic harm that she did not feel the need to formally reply to my argument because I \"did not cite where\" my \"facts are where from\" (This grammatically should be \"were from\") . That is a sorry excuse for what is truly a lack of a refutation for my argument. He/she moves on to saying that my source is from 1990, and then because of that completely rejects my argument. There are better ways to refute this than just pointing out an outdated source (which has no relevance whatsoever and doesn't disprove anything). He/she then moves on to give examples of a merchant saving and losing 2 pennies. However, the example that my opponent provides is what I like to call a utopian example. It's perfect, and it just seems to work out. However, not everything will perfectly balance out like this. Here's a counterexample: A merchant owns a store. The price, after tax, comes down to $11.88 and it gets rounded to $11.90 since it is a cash purchase; the merchant gains 2 pennies. However, the next person buys an item that totals to $11.91, and it gets rounded to $11.90; the merchant loses one penny. When simple math is done, it can be shown that, in this example, 1 penny is obviously lost. Not every transactions will perfectly counteract each other as my opponent suggestions, therefore, multiply this imperfect transaction by hundreds of thousands occurrences a day, and you will lose, more or less, $600 million a year, as Raymand Lombra puts it. Refutation 2: Minting Cost In this refutation, my opponent responds my point by stating that my point is invalid because the minting price is worth more than the face value, even though it is lower than what he/she originally said. I have 2 responses for this. 1) I strongly disagree as this does not disprove my point whatsoever since the manufacturing value has declined since 2011. It has been on the decline, and since it is 1.7 cents, it is only a loss of .7 cents per each penny. Why should we get rid of the penny if we lose 3 cents on each nickel as they cost 8 cents to mint (http://blogs.wsj.com...)? My opponent's logic is to get abolish its creation and circulation because it costs more to manufacture than its actual value, so why not get rid of the nickel as well since it is more of a loss than the penny? 2) \"Thus what we have with the penny and the nickel is the last, residual restraint that the government actually faces when it manufactures money. This money, this petty change, actually costs something to make. Which would be precisely why we should insist that the United States keep making it. It can remind the country of how properly to conduct monetary policy. When market signals say you are pushing too hard, stop it. The real economy will respond by getting back to what it does best, which is roaring.\" -http://www.forbes.com... If you don't want to read the article, it basically says that pennies are good for the economy, especially since they are made out of a semi-precious metal, because it will not get overproduced, thereby meaning that having a higher manufacturing value is actually a good thing, turning and capturing my opponent's point. Refutation 3: Charities Pro brings up that I am the actual one dancing on this one, however fails to back that statement as well as simply asserting that his/her quote is not contradictory without an explanation. He/she also misunderstood my logic. As I said, since pennies are worth less, people will donate more of them, totalling to a greater amount of money for charities. Sure, this is an assumption, but it's a logical one unlike the assumption made by Pro, who becomes a hypocrite by stating that I have no proof, hounding me for a source from 1990, and then using a source from 1992. Therefore, my charities point should get through. Refutation 4: Canadian Pro definitely does have the right to use international experience anywhere he/she pleases, however, as proved and agreed with by him/her, Canada and America definitely do have completely different economies (http://www.thestar.com...). The same goes for Australia. Therefore, Pro has conceded to this point. Refutations to Arguments: Refutation 1: Waste of Time Pennies are not a waste of time. No matter who, they always have a meaning, whether it is an emotional connection between father and son, mother and daughter, the ability to save someone's life from cancer when being donated to charity, or being lucky when picked up from the street. Also, see my refutation 2 above for a further refutation that applies to this as well. Saying that pennies are a waste of time is like saying that an abused dog is not worth saving. Refutation 2: Not Accepted for all Purchases My opponent's second argument is that pennies are not accepted for all purposes. I completely agree, in fact this is common sense. But this argument was just a waste of time in that it is not tied in and plays no role in the scheme of things. Refutation 3: Bad for the Environment Saying that pennies are bad for the environment is a bold, overreaching statement. Sure, pennies are bad for the environment when dropped, but the number of pennies laying around on someone's lawn is so insignificant that this portion of the argument does not help prove anything. I, as well, agree that zinc mines harm the environment, but don't take the penny out of service to fix this. They're still going to make zinc for other purposes, it is not the penny that is causing the harm, it is the zinc mines. Pennies are innocent. Weighing: Economical Harm vs. Waste of Time (Con 1 vs. Pro 1): In this situation, my argument is clearly stronger do to the fallacious logic and overarching bold statements presented by Pro. The impact of losing ~$600 million/year and the other chaos that will potentially break loose is more significant than a few cents being wasted here and there. To put this in simpler terms, $600,000,000 > $3.65. Charities vs. Environment (Con 2 vs. Pro 3): With Pro's argument focusing on such an insignificant scope/area and my argument logically demonstrating harm to charities, it's no wonder my point is stronger in this instance as well. The Burden: Pro had three prongs to prove, yet he/she said that it does not have to be proved as I am the instigator. I strongly disagree as Pro is the side trying to change the status quo, and with that, you need to prove how your plan is going to be effective, which has not been done. These are the three unproved prongs: 1) I have clearly refuted this, disproving what my opponent attempted to say, therefore leaving this prong unproved. 2) Somewhat proved, but not all the way. 3) Once again, there has been no clear explanation as to how Pro's plan will \"transition into this change smoothly with minimal harm and maximum benefit.\" As the burden is left unproved, Pro does not have a case sufficient to win this debate, therefore resulting in a clear reason to vote for me, Con. The decision is up to the voters now. Conclusion: I'd like to thank my opponent for this great debate from which I have learned a lot and all future voters for exercising judgment as to who won. As a 13 year-old, it is hard to debate an economic topic against someone with a business diploma. I wish luck to my opponent as the debate comes to a close.

(Kleptin Tourney) Content: Thanks for the great debate, Con! :) Pro Case --------------- Pro 1A: Consumer Confidence 1. I wasn't placing a \"definitely will\" burden of proof on said finance minister. However, the quotation itself shows little reason to believe that discarding the penny will lead to imminent downfall of the economy. Furthermore, most of the harms that the Minister cites have to do with not minting low denomination coins, not specifically one-cent coins. The minister's harms come from all coins. Counterplan: 1. My opponent seems to think that we don't spend money to mint anything but zinc. Any metal will cost us money to utilize, so we still spend more than the penny's elimination. 2. Cost stats still stand. See later responses. On Abuse: 1. This is still abusive. My opponent needed to detail the text of his counterplan in the first round, thereby giving us both enough time to properly discuss the merits and drawbacks of using such a metal. This is pretty critical to his counterplan, so claiming that it would be akin to \"picking a random metal\" is just a cop-out. 2. My opponent chose a metal that is actually more expensive, and will remain more expensive, than zinc. Over the last 15 years, aluminum has consistently been more expensive per pound than zinc. [1] Imagine how much worse the harms are at the point where we accept the counterplan. Though my opponent asserts he has a source stating otherwise, even his own source indicates that aluminum is more expensive than zinc (.9369 cash value to .9276 cash value right now). 3. The US aluminum market is incredibly unhealthy. Aluminum exports alone have tanked 43.8% in the last fiscal year. [2] Furthermore, since aluminum is so abundant, we don't have any sort of monopoly potential on it. Furthermore, guess who the number 1 producer of aluminum is? China. [3] Pro 1B: Cash Transactions Cheaper 1. Unless my opponent thinks that debit card, credit card, or check transactions are going away anytime soon, then I'm not obligated to compare the cost of cash transactions to the cost of any other transaction. I still cut spending out of the status quo, and that's all I'm obligated to do. 2. Until my opponent addresses my analysis on cost of using pennies in transactions, we can assume it's extended. Note that my opponent's initial response only states that cash transactions are cheaper than other types of transactions, which does not link at all to the affirmative advocacy. Cash transactions become more expensive when pennies are involved, which was the original argument. The wasted money still remains if you negate, even if you use aluminum. NACS: 1. Search where I told you to, please. First RD 1 source, CTRL F, \"Walgreens.\" It's there. I promise. 2. Call B.S. all you want, but that website is just as reliable as any other source in the debate, including your CATO Institute and the blog citations. The man who maintains this website, Jeff Gore, is a physicist at M.I.T. That does give him some sort of professional, academic credibility, don't you think? However, if it'll make my opponent happy, I will email Jeff and ask him for his citation. Pro Contention 2 Cross-Application of Counterplan: 1. Apply all three of my abuse responses to the aluminum counterplan. Fail plan. 2. I'm a she. 3. Doesn't matter how much time I had. This is like waiting until cross-examination to read plan text. It isn't my job to coax his full plan out of him. He made it\u2014he should state it up front. Brightline: My argument is that we already aren't acting freely, but no, I can't fix a $ amount to this. Foreign politics doesn't boil down to solely mathematics, and to expect that of me is downright silly. I do, however, prove conclusively that we are greatly indebted to China, which will in turn affect our foreign policy decisions with regards to not only China, but a number of other key countries. This goes unrefuted. Human Rights: 1. As the CATO Institute author readily admits, \"Although market reforms do not guarantee greater respect for human rights, economic prosperity brought increased pressure for democracy in such countries as South Korea and Taiwan.\" South Korea and Taiwan cannot possibly be compared to China, who, as my opponent mentions, is responding to capitalist expansion into their markets poorly. If this gentleman from the CATO Institute was correct, then the Great Firewall should have been down by now. China has the manpower to lead production, and their economic ascendancy shows this. Encouraging freer trade with such a nation does nothing but entrench their buying and selling power, which in turn encourages the Chinese government to strengthen itself and shirk off the criticisms and actions laid down against it by the likes of the U.S., who are too tied to it to act. 2. My opponent's responses, and the CATO Institute article, conveniently ignore ethical concerns surrounding the issue. By funding such a country, in which the government routinely abuses human rights, we are implicitly compromising our own ideals as a nation by supporting these actions. ---------------- Neg Case ---------------- Neg Contention 1: All my opponent did was re-assert that I can't prove any of my cost stats. That's based on a lack of acknowledgement of most of the sources I used in RD 1 and a challenge of legitimacy to the first source in RD 1. Neg Contention 2: On #1: 1. I don't immediately eliminate the penny. They'd most likely remain in circulation for a while. Immediate harms cannot be accessed by my opponent, which I pointed out in my last response. 2. Extend what I said about inflation being a wash. It still is, no matter how many times my opponent repeats himself. On #2 1. This doesn't answer the response I gave. Lombra is very specific about inflationary impact of the rounding tax. What he says afterwards is that those impacts might cumulate over time, and then cites his \"$2 billion in spending by 2010\" estimate. He doesn't say anything about individual items\u2026? Neg Contention 3: On #1: The price stays raised to cover your rounding tax each year. I don't get why this negates what I said, which is that the tax would only need to make up the 30% profit lost of a 6-7 cent net profit. Even if we assume the worst, an item will never go up more than 2 cents in cost. We only need to aim for the closest \"5\" or \"0\" in a price (i.e. $2.99 is rounded to $3.00, while $2.97 becomes $2.95). On #2: Though the financial implications still remain, I typo'd on cents vs. seconds. My bad. I won't concede the financial impacts of the rounding tax, but I will advocate that you disregard what I said about 2-2.5 cents in the last RD. On #3: My sources are perfectly adequate. On #4 (Theft): 1. My opponent's source only deals in credit cards, not debit cards. Moreover, food stamps are now entirely electronic, though I don't know how much of the transaction market they monopolize (I do know that 19 million people participate in food stamp programs in the US). Debit card transactions in the US are on the rise [4], so I still don't bite those harms to the point of voting against my position. 2. I also asserted that, because the likelihood of carrying all other change vs. the penny has not been properly established, and because I'm not eliminated the use of all coins, the harms won't come to fruition. I don't stop merchants from making totals that require exact change. My opponent hasn't warranted how pricing something at $2.47 is inherently less dangerous than pricing it at $2.45.

Without the penny the government estimates it will save 7.6 TRILLION dollars in just ten years. http://www.enzi.senate.gov...Argument 1: Economical HarmI don't think you quite understand the \"penny plan\". As a Canadian (with a diploma in business) I have witnessed this plan first hand. The consumers worried that their $19.99 product will increased to $20.00 need not worry as it will stay at $19.99. The penny only effects Cash transactions, not electronic. all debit, gift card, credit card, cheque, etc. will be handled as if there is a penny.As for rounding of pennies the cost of using cash normally does not change. We use a complete rounding system, not a rounding up system as you implied. This means that $1.01 and $1.02 would be rounded down to $1, while $1.03 and $1.04 would be rounded up to $1.05. If you play close enough attention to your pennies you can actually save money by only using cash when it is time to round down, but not much. http://www.cbc.ca...Argument 2: CharitiesThe penny is the most donated coin, yet it can be quickly over shadowed by the nickel (5-1). There is no evidence that suggests people who donate will simply stop donating because there is no penny. In fact donations may rise because people \"have\" to give more then just a couple pennies. Furthermore Charities in Canada held drives to collect the \"worthless\" pennies once they where discontinued. http://theotherpress.ca...", "qid": 45, "docid": "540788cc-2019-04-18T15:19:54Z-00004-000", "score": 8.12440013885498}, {"content": "Title: The U.S. Penny Should Be Abolished Content: Although Con did defy my rules, Con messaged me in a friend request his/her apologies. Voters, please do not take off points as long as Con does not do it again. Con, if you would, please repost your arguments when it is your turn. I don't care if you copy and paste what you had written, as long as you stay with the format. Anyway, onto my arguments. I have two main arguments for my case, both of which are comprised of smaller points. My first main argument is that U.S. pennies are just a drag on not only the economy, but all of us in general. My first proof is that pennies just aren't worth the time to earn them. The average hourly wage for workers was $22.33 in 2013 (Source: http://www.bls.gov...). That means more than a cent every two seconds, and five cents every ten seconds. Even if you use the median wage, the calculations are still very close. It takes such a little time to earn pennies that it wouldn't affect finances if it was removed. As further proof that pennies aren't worth the time, look to the grocery store. In the U.S., unlike other countries, the tax isn't included on the price tag. The vast majority of people just can't do the math in their head without a calculator, and most just wait until the checkout to find the true price. This means it takes time to count out the pennies, wasting time. It may not seem very important, but it could make a huge difference if pennies were removed. As a matter of fact, there's relatively little that pennies are used for now. No modern vending machine accepts pennies. The only one that does is Coinstar, which is a machine that takes your coins and gives you them back, with a slight amount taken away. Essentially, it is an ATM for solely coins. Lastly, it would benefit the U.S. economy to get rid of pennies. Pennies cost more to make than their face value (no pun intended) (Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com...).

My point here was that pennies stay in currency a long time, and have much more usage potential than a dollar, and certainly more than the 1.8 cents they cost. As for printing extra pennies, thereby reducing the value, that does not support stopping the production of the penny. Pennies can be, and are, created at such an amount simply to make up for the pennies that were either destroyed or fell out of currency. 2. I did not mean to say I agree with you, I was actually trying to indicate that I was going to use the same argument later. While the penny does not have much buying power, it is used extensively in currency. One often gets more pennies back from a cash purchase than any other type of money. This leads into the third part of the next section. 3. I like your point here, but you forget that our money system is cent-based. And while the penny does not have much buying penny, it still has its value, whether you want to donate it or roll it up into a neat little parcel and exchange at the bank. Also, just because the penny doesn't have much value today because of inflation doesn't mean it will never have value again. If you eliminate it now, re-starting production would be even more fiscally infeasible than it is now. Other Rebuttal: 1. The system suggested would indeed work to price things without the penny, but would be difficult and unruly, and end of costing one a lot more a year. The more you break up earnings and values down, the more accurate something's cost can be, and the less it will end up costing. 2. While in theory this is correct, that these charities will not lose money, it is interesting that more nickels and dimes aren't given, since their worth so little, and that pennies make up such a large percentage. 3. Fair enough. The point here I was making, however, is that the same arguments could be made for nickels, and then possibly for dimes.", "qid": 45, "docid": "652f23f4-2019-04-18T17:28:19Z-00002-000", "score": 7.650199890136719}, {"content": "Title: New Federal and State employees should not receive a pension. Content: I'll start at the bottom: As regards to the $10 million or \"one penny and have it double itself everyday for a month\", I'm going to assume you actually mean have the total double every day for a month (otherwise, if only that penny doubles itself every day, you just get a new penny every day, but as this is an old puzzle that's usually phrased a little differently, I'm assuming you mean that). February would net you $1,342,177.28 ($2,684,354.56 on leap years), while any thirty day month would net you $5,368,709.12, and only a month with 31 days would really be worth it, because that would get you $10,737,418.24. So the answer is \"depends on the month\". (And to math geek out a bit, if the answer to \"which month\" is \"random month\", then it would be worse to take the penny than the $10 mil, since you have a 58.3% chance of <1 mil increase, but a 41.6% chance of a losing at least $4631290.88, or more in the case of February, and the profit/loss of that is not something I'd take). I'm not sure how this relates to the debate at hand, unless you're thinking of \"tricking\" employees into taking a worse deal. I'd rather government try to stay away from tricking people, myself. However, if your position was \"Offer higher wages OR a pension, and see if you can get rid of the pension by attrition\", I wouldn't object, but I also wouldn't think it would work. I think most employees wouldn't give up their guaranteed pension unless they got a HUGE increase in salary. About pensions: While the Burden of Proof rests on you for why things should be changed from their status quo, if we're going to shift to the concept of pensions as a general concept: Pensions exist to take care of employees who are retiring. They're there so that, when someone is too old to work any more, they're taken care of by the employer to whom they gave their youth. The same Labor movement that brought about the concept of the 8-hour workday, and increased pay for overtime, brought about pensions. Unfortunately, only part of the Labor movement's advances were enshrined in law; this gave employees a false sense of security, and when the Unions were weakened years later, anything not required by law started to be stripped away. That is why pensions aren't as common as they used to be. That is why, until the recent changes in law, insurance benefits were being eroded. I, for one, do not want to see a regression of the country. At the same time, I understand not wanting to intrude too much into private business. But the state should do what we expect a good employer to do, and we should expect a good employer to take care of its employees.

In Washington state they had a case in their SSM ban, they held 5-4 that the law was consitutional and one reason was procreation. (1). It furthered the states interest in marriage, up bringing of children. One of the justices said banning SSM raises procreation rates, making more children. She also claimed that was the reason (one of them) that the state recognizes straight marriage. (1) Another argument you will press is \"marriage is love not procreation\". To a normal person yes, but if that was the case then why would the state recognize marriage? There would be no benefit, no reason for the state to recognize it, therefore there is a reason, procreation. The most common discussed state reason for banning SSM is procreation, that is the reason the state is hesitant to agnolage it. (2) C2: health risks of gay sexual behavior Please no wordplay here, I mean MSM men having sex with men and the risks. Gays accounted for 53% of the new aids/HIV infections in the US, and in 2006 held again 53% of all of the virus in total. (3) now why is this significant? Because the total gay population is America is 10% at most, or under. (4). So let's use the census estimate, 2-3%, that 3% has more then half of the aids virus. Now are they more likely to get the aids virus or is it a myth? They are more likely. MSM where 44 times more likely to be diagnosed with the aids virus then other men. (3) C3: slippery slope Let me use a few examples: Guns: After the passage of the 1991 Brady bill the pro gun controllers celebrated their victory. The NRA lost their threshold and the amount of guns in circulations declined, the momentum against guns increased. It had an effect on people's minds. (5) Perfect example. Now an SSM example: In 2003 Canadian courts allowed SSM in Ontario, after that is quickly spread to all of the other provinces. (6) Also polygamy advocates say the only criteria for marriage is love, well in that case polygamy should be legalized etc. Once marriage is no longer 1 man + 1 woman then the definition changes, and there's no way to stop the other marriage forms. (7) C4: the economy 1138, that's the amount of provisions used on marriage that are basically benefits. (8). In the UK there is a 150\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd tax return. (9) but in the US it just consists of benefits, but how is this bad? 1$ spent here is one dollar not spent on a tax return or well fare etc. it wastes a dollar. This is said by Michael Steele a GOP chairman, it hurts small buisness as a penny on marriage = a penny not in Healthcare. (10) Conclusion; No SSM!

Definitions: Penny Taken Out of Service: All pennies within the United States will neither be minted nor accepted as legal tender. Plan: As I am Con, it is not my job to address a plan, so the plan must be addressed by Pro. Burden of Proof: Here, I'd like to establish a 3-pronged burden of proof for Pro. In order for Pro to win this debate, he/she must prove the following three items: 1) The harm of the penny is sufficient enough to justify its removal from the market. 2) Taking the penny out of service will minimalistically harm the economy. 3) Their plan is good enough to transition into this change smoothly with minimal harm and maximum benefit. If any fragment of these three items is left unproved, then I, Con, will win this debate. Arguments: I would like to bring 2 major points into this debate. Argument 1: Economical Harm The US penny should not be taken out of service because it will harm the economy. Even though it is only one cent, the penny is extremely important in the way the US economic system works. How can we achieve the same amount of exactness in change and payments as we do with the penny? The only answer is rounding, but that is detrimental to the economy. According to pennies. org, propositions take the penny out of service and utilize the nickel as the coin of lowest value create public anxiety about higher prices and inflation. Over three-quarters of Americans (77%) are concerned that merchants would raise prices without the penny. And, most likely, they are correct. Professor of Economics at Penn State University Raymond Lombra, Ph. D. said to a Congressional committee that rounding cash sales up or down to the nearest nickel would cost consumers over $600 million annually. For example, you are a merchant who runs a clothing store. You charge $11 for a t-shirt, and the sales tax in California is 7.5%. You have a customer, and he/she pays in cash. The amount comes down to $11.86 with the sales tax. But, wait\" you have no pennies! How do you get the extra cent when there are no cents? The only answer is to round the price down to $11.85, but then you're losing a cent! When the penny is taken out of service, multiply this example by millions per day, and, as Raymond Lombra puts it, $600 million is now lost per year versus when the penny was still in service. $600 million dollars being lost just from taking a coin out of service is an extremely significant amount that cannot be ignored. A whopping majority of 77% of the general public is worried about taking the penny out of service. Without the penny, the the general public will lose money and the US economic situation will worsen. Argument 2: Charities The US penny should not be taken out of service because charities need pennies. There are a plethora of small charities that depend on penny drive to bring in donations. People think nothing of pouring out their old penny jars to support these drives, but they won't part with nickels so easily. Many corporations, national charities, schools, and local philanthropies have realized the worth of the penny. Through the use of point-of-sale collections, penny drives and competitive penny fundraisers, these groups have turned thousands of idle pennies into real dollars for everything from college scholarships to cancer research and housing for the homeless. One major example is Pennies for Patients, and without pennies, it would be nickels for patients, but that doesn't sound good! Pennies always have a worth to someone no matter who he/she may be. Pennies rescue people battling terrible diseases such as cancer. Pennies can save lives. College scholarships and cancer research rely on pennies. We, the opposition, want the best in the future, and the best is not to eliminate the penny.", "qid": 45, "docid": "540788cc-2019-04-18T15:19:54Z-00005-000", "score": 6.814599990844727}, {"content": "Title: The use of pennies in the US pricing system should be eliminated. Content: Thank you for the quick response. Sadly, my opponent misunderstood me. I do not contradict myself. Yes, I do believe the penny holds a sentimental value. However it should be eliminated because it does not have a benefit towards its purpose of facilitating exchange. My opponent forgot to mention the part where I stated, \"If it is of no benefit. .. not facilitating exchange. \" {1} To my opponent, I did incorporate the parts where you stated \"If it is of no benefit. .. not facilitating exchange. \"{1} To Voters as well as my opponent, the biggest flaw made by my opponent within this statement is the use of the word \"facilitate\". Facilitate means to \"Make (an action or process) easy or easier. \"{2} With this said, we can clearly see that the penny under my opponents term and use of the word facilitate, achieves its purpose as it allows for us to access every cent of a dollar, which then makes the exchange of goods easier to occur and thus should remain. \"eliminating the penny is not equivalent to abolishing the American Flag because whereas the American Flag's purpose is to serve as a \"symbolic of nationhood and identity,\"[1] the true purpose of the penny or any money in general is to \"function as a medium of exchange when it is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services. . .. .My opponent's comparison between the eliminating of the penny with abolishing the American Flag is a non-sequitar comparison and should not be considered. \"{1} How is this comparison invalid? Yes, I admit the fact that the American Flag achieves its purpose in terms of patriotic symbol of nationhood and identity, but like stated earlier, the penny also achieves its purpose of facilitating the exchange process as well as achieving its sentimental purpose. In conclusion, eliminating the penny, is equivalent to eliminating the American Flag. \"Again, this is a non-sequitar comparison and therefore should not be considered. The purpose of a penny is not the same as the purpose of the Statue of Liberty. My opponent is saying that anything that does not contribute to the good of the economy whilst I am saying that monetary mediums such as pennies should be eliminated is they do not contribute to the good. \"{1} My opponent misunderstand's the reason for making this comparison. In his second rebuttal, my opponent stated that \"Our economy is suffering with, as I stated above, at least $15 billion from time wasted with these pennies. \"{1} This comparison was made to attack my opponents argument that since the penny is disproportional to our economic goals, then it should be eliminated. This comparison is simple trying to convey to both my opponent and the public, that just like the statue of liberty that does not comply to our economic goal, we should not eliminate the penny, as it achieves its purpose in both facilitating the economy and sentimental value and commemoration of the past president. \"My opponent does not realize that keeping the penny would make \"giving up the [penny] harder because the [penny] can now be seen as the only way to complete a purchase. \" However, as my opponent mentioned the success of the Penny Drive, obviously that claim is false and the nickel would be just as easily given up. \" This statement completely contradicts my opponents stand within this debate. My opponent through out this debate constantly stated that the penny is worthless and thus would be easier to neglect and many places do not accept the penny, now he is saying that people will hesitate to donate a penny. In terms of penny drive and its Success using the nickel, my opponent although asked in my previous argument to show his evidence fails to do so. So his claim that the nickel would be as easily giving up should be seen as simple opinion without evidence. \"Sadly, my opponent misunderstood my calculations. My opponent has no justification as to why 8400 people donating a penny could be as likely as 84 people donating a nickel but I do for my calculations. Take situation A where donors only donate pennies and situation B where donors only donate nickels. As previously stated by my opponent himself, 15.5% of American people are of the lower class and would have trouble donating a single nickel (which I personally find difficult to believe unless those individuals had absolutely no idea of the severity of poverty around the world. Most of America's homeless are better off thank some average people of third world countries. ) and so mathematically speaking, 100% - 15.5% = 84.5% would be able to donate a nickel. For the sake of easy math, let's say that situation A has 1000 donors all capable of donating a penny. However, since situation B donors are donating nickels, we must take into consideration the lower class who are reluctant to give that nickel. Therefore, situation A would have 1000 people whereas situation B would only have 845 people. Situation A would make 1000 x $0.01 = $10. Yet, Situation B would make 845 x $0.05 = $42.25. So mathematically, asking for a nickel would not only be more profitable but also it would help the mission of the charities which my opponent was concerned about. \" My opponent has no justification to say that these much people will be willing to donate there nickel so in the same term, how is he to say that over 18,000 people will be able to donate a penny compared to the 100 people who donate the nickel. The point is that since I provided evidence showing that pennies are more likely donated than nickels, my scenario clearly overturns my opponent's scenario. \">($655508.54 asking for pennies) x (84.5% of people rather than the complete 100%) x (5 as that is the amount of times a nickel is worth over a penny) = $2,769,523.58 The price here comes out to be more because above, I approximated 84.5% to 84 in favor of my opponent because there is no such thing as .5 of a person. However, this time I took into consideration 1000 people providing a more accurate result. \" This makes absolutely no sense. I asked for evidence not personal calculation. As for the 84.5% middle and upper class, who is to say that they wouldn't give the charities pennies because they asked for pennies. The 15.5 lower class evidence was not to show how many people donates, but to show the percent of people who would be greatly affected by the elimination of the penny. \"My opponent misunderstood my claim that \"$7.02 as $6.98\" would be just as likely. It is saying that the probability of an item costing $7.02 would be the same as an item costing $6.98 and therefore would both round to $7.00 cancelling each other out. .. The fact that a business normally makes 3,000 sales makes the statistical probability of rounded prices cancelling each other greater and more ideal. \" Following my opponents new calculation, this completely goes against his idea that a coin is in existence to facilitate the economy. If the penny already makes it easier to complete an exchange, then why eliminate it? Also my opponents scenario is highly unlikely as producers are more likely to round up rather than down. so the $7.02 item would be rounded to $7.05 and since the $6.98 item is round up to $7.00, then the overall consumer is now loosing $1,200 following the 3000 costumer scenario. This means that the elimination of the coin will defeat my opponents main purpose of eliminating the penny, as exchange is now harder for the consumer. Voters: I win because I showed how the penny facilitates the process of exchange. I win because I showed that the penny has other value other than its face value. I win in argument as I defended as well as attacked my opponents arhuments My opponent drops some of my arguments such the argument that eliminating the penny hurts the poor, and the argument that eliminating the penny means an increase production of the nickel which cost more to produce than the penny.

I don\u2019t mind having some fun but we should be a bit more serious. I also must apologize for forfeiting round two. I had meant to post my argument but time hadn\u2019t allowed. However, I digress\u2026 As for the penny and nickel: be it resolved that both the penny and the nickel be eliminated from the production of coins by the US Mint. To begin, let\u2019s make sure we understand some background information. The penny has been fluctuating in price for the past several years. Pennies are made of both copper and zinc, and these metals have both become rather pricey in the past several years. Currently, the price to produce one penny is roughly 1.7\u00a2 [1]. This alone should cause you to vote in the affirmation of this resolution. The penny is literally worth less than we pay for. Also, over 13,000,000,000 pennies each year [2]. Let\u2019s do some math now. To find the total amount of dollars spent on producing pennies we will take the cost of producing a penny and multiply it by the amount of pennies produced in a year. When we do this, we discern a monetary total of $221,000,000. Now if we subtract the spending value of all these pennies from our production cost, we lose a total of $91,000,000. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if less money was spent producing the penny than it is worth. Lastly, the US Mint is a government run organization. All of the funding it receives to produce these coins comes directly from taxpayer pockets. We cannot allow any more tax dollars to be needlessly wasted like this, especially if it is such a large number as $91,000,000. The second half of the proposed resolution is to discontinue the nickel. Allow me to explain why we need to do this. As you should remember, there is a massive inequality between the production cost and face value of the penny. Guess what! The nickel is the exact same way. The production cost for a single nickel is 11.2\u00a2 [3]. This is an even greater inequality that the penny, seeing as it is more than twice as expensive to produce than it is a face value. There are roughly 4,300,000,000 nickels produced in a year [3]. Doing the same math as before, we find that we are losing a total of $266,600,000. Combining this with the deficit created by the penny inequality, we find that we are losing $357,600,000 annually. We cannot allow this. Any product that wastes any amount of tax dollars should be cut out of production. It\u2019s very simple. It should seem obvious that there is only one logical choice in this debate; to discontinue the penny and the nickel from the US Mint\u2019s production of coins. We would save millions of dollars by deciding on this resolution. Considering all these things, I must urge a vote to Pro. Works Cited 1) \"Cost to Make the Penny: Chart/Graph. \" Copper Pennies.

Con did everything within an ability to follow that instruction. Pro made all legitimate claims for reason to stop minting the penny. I agree, I too felt the penny should go at one time. Why attack a legitimate claim that is actually part of the job the penny is used for, something I did not know at the time. Just as the cost of production is a gauge on a much larger machine. Yes it cost more to make then the materials it is made of. There can be a hundred good reasons to hurt someone justification never makes it right just necessary . 1.Pro is incapable of understanding what the actual pennies value is. It is unclear if I can explain it to every-on let alone just one person. I will try any-way. The penny is the same as the small line on a clock that equals seconds. These lines cost more than they are worth to put on the clock, we actually don\"t need them. Why have they? Simple they are part of that measurement device. Do you have to use them? No! Of course not. Do other people need them? 1.(A) The people who use the penny the most do not always touch the penny. So it is understandable how some-one does not know that a penny is actually a negative number outside cost in an economy gauge (measurement). It is not just one number it is two numbers, first number is .01 the second number is .0001. 100 points of measurement make up one dollar multiply that 100 by, 0001 and the answer is .01 one-penny. This argument and number three are connected. 2. The money is being sent inappropriately, not will be. One of the highest cost of the penny is not the production of the penny it is enforcing the law that should have protected the penny. The penny has been used as an inexpensive way to mine metals directly out of an economy. This is where a 2.41 cost ratio of roughly 3 to 1 is minimal as the cost to enforce the law is substantially higher. This cost can be seen as $3.00 dollars or greater to every .01 penny in production. ( 300+ / 1 ) It is this cost which has been squandered on other things. 3.The penny has lost its buying power. It was lost, it had buying power at one time. There had been many things a penny could by with its value. Where did it go? Pro should be telling is why we do not want that buying power back. Not telling us why he or others do not want to do the work to get that power back. It is not better than the National clock it is tide to debt.

My opponent states that pennies are economic indicators, but offers no evidence, either objective or analytical. This means that this argument should be ignored due to the lack of support. 4.

Content: The background provided by weirdman in undoubtably true. No denying history. However, he contended that \"With this being said, we can clearly see that the penny seen as one of the first American formulated coins, possess a both patriotic as well as personal value. \" On the other hand, my point was that the penny possessed such negligible value today such that the economy is actually losing money manufacturing it and where a dime is worth a penny during 1970. One can imagine the value it may have possessed in the past but that is not the point of this debate. It is about the penny now. (Please correct me if I am getting your point about the penny being of personal value incorrect. )The fact that the penny is a medium of patriotism does not matter. Our economy is suffering with, as I stated above, at least $15 billion from time wasted with these pennies. Furthermore, there are a lot of places that don't even accept pennies. Vending machines, toll booths, laundromats, and pay phones will spit them out or even sound an alarm. Many people simply place their pennies in a jar, or a 5-gallon water jug. \"The purpose of the monetary system is to facilitate exchange, but I have to acknowledge that the penny no longer serves that purpose. When people start leaving a monetary unit at the cash register for the next customer, the unit is too small to be useful. \" Greg Mankiw, EconomistI agree with my opponent that the penny does serve towards patriotism but the fact that our economy is losing more money than necessary in this poor economy is a sure indicator that money should be treated as money. If it is of no benefit or as Greg Mankiw stated, not facillitating exchange, which the penny is clearly, then we should eliminate it. Another popular belief I forgot to mention is the one my opponent brings up. Many people believe that eliminating the penny would, in fact, harm the amount of money spent towards charities. This argument ignores that fact that the charitable organization could simply ask for a donation of a nickel. My opponent mentioned that 15.5% of the American population is of the lower class and therefore would have problems. However, that means that 84.5% of the population is of the middle or upper class. Take a hundred people giving a donation of a penny. The charity would make $1.00. Now, take 84 people donating a nickel. That charity would be making $4.20 a $3.20 profit. If my calculations are correct, JC PENNY's Penny Drive would have made $2,753,135.87 asking for a nickel. Economics Professor Ray Lombra may have believed that most prices would have been rounded up but a Washington Post article says otherwise. \"Robert M. Whaples of Wake Forest University has analyzed 200,000 transactions across seven states, and he concluded that consumers would not actually suffer. Purchases at gas stations and convenience stores are just as likely to come to $7.02 as $6.98, so the rounding up and rounding down would cancel themselves out. On average, shoppers would lose nothing. \" Statistically, there would be no loss of money by rounding. My question to weirdman would be why more production of the nickel be necessary. It would take four pennies to pay any $0. X4 (X representing any positive integer less than 10) but one would technically only need one nickel at most to to pay for any $0. X5. Also, utilizing the time to figure out the exact change of these prices would be worth it. I thank commentor \"Janus\" for bringing up a relevant question. No, we would not round to the nearest bill. My point was the we would eliminate the penny. Therefore, we would round up and down accordingly to mathematics and thus, prices would statistically cancel out.

First, it's not worth your time for pennies. Literally, if you pick up a penny off the street, you could have made more money in that exact frame of time. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median hourly wage for all occupations is $16.87 per hour. Do the math, and that means a tiny bit more than a cent is earned every 3 seconds, and 5 cents every 11 seconds. This clearly shows how little the value of the penny is. Ignoring that, the U.S. could save money by getting rid of the pennies. According to the U.S. Mint, it costs more than 2 cents to create one penny. This means that the U.S. is losing tons of money by creating pennies. Also, a single penny can't buy you products anymore. The only machine at all that accepts pennies is... ...Coinstar.

Even after that penny in the $0.99 transaction is returned, the penny will most likely end up in a jar dead to the economy not fulfilling its role as currency. The fact that machines such as Coin Star exist that take advantage of the inconvenience and uselessness of pennies to make money off of people just proves my point. Many businesses and organizations recognize the cost of transporting and counting the pennies isn\"t worth it. One of these organizations includes a little organization known as the United States Military, where in overseas bases have banned the use of pennies. They also contradict your definition of consumerism as because those who use exact change to pay for items waste the time of those waiting and overall, the rate at which things are sold decreases. There is a simple answer as to what happens after the penny is abolished. There are many countries around the world including New Zealand, Canada, etc. that have gotten rid of their lowest unit of currency and ended up fine. None of these countries have saw high degrees of inflation or drop in charitable donation. The US could easily take after those countries. Also this sort of process isn\"t anything new to the US as we went through the same process when ditching the half-cent coin in the 1800\"s for the same reasons we should ditch the penny. Abolishing the penny would actually do it good. As the amount of pennies decrease as they are melted, lost, etc. their value begins to increase again.

I am not sure why my point is not valid. Every time a penny is used, is further stimulates the economy, making it more and more useful and valuable, if not literally worth more. I am not sure I understand con's point. The dollar is worth a lot more than the penny, but it is also worth a lot more than the quarter. Would you eliminate everything worth less than the dollar, because the dollar is more valuable? This is not an argument. 2. The argument I clearly articulated here was that the penny is still used in purchases and exchanges, which my opponent claimed it did not. 3. As you said yourself, the penny is not valuable, so I would not say inflation is at all reliant on further creation of pennies. I looked it up and could not find out whether the Government actually creates more pennies than there are, or just makes up for the ones fallen out of currency. The latter is the way it should be, but does not make an argument for completely halting production. My point about the penny some day being worth more I assume is still valid, as there was no mention of it in my opponent's argument. Other Rebuttal :D: 1. I think we can agree that businesses would round up, not down. A business would definitely not want to lose money off the new system. Also, I think 50$ is low balling it a bit. Simply on groceries, a whole year's worth of rounding up would cost you more. Even so, 50$ is no small sum, especially in today's economy. 2. I did not intend to concede this point, if that's the impression I gave you. If people were wiling to part with nickles and dimes, and since they are worth far more than the penny, you would see a much larger percentage paid with nickels and dimes. But you don't, implying people are willing to donate pennies, but not nickels and dimes. To be fair, that might change if the penny was no longer produced, and this isn't much of an argument anyway. 3. Yeah, kinda pointless. In my defense, I brought it up to show there was no distinction is argument between eliminating pennies and eliminating other types of currency. Conclusion: As the penny is a current part of our currency, I feel it is fair to put the burden of proof on con. My opponent made no strong case for why the penny should be stopped altogether, with the one clear downside being the taxpayer money used to produce the pennies.

Hope Pro doesn't mind. Consumerism - the theory that an increasing consumption of goods and services is economically desirable. Instant gratification - The consumer receiving the good/service immediately or in an expedited manner upon paying for it, instead of a delay. Definitions adapted from merriamwebster.com My argument for keeping the penny is a simple one. Not everyone has a credit card. There are those of us who have to make do with the money in our pockets when we go spending. The penny allows for cashiers to make change more easily. For example, a $0.99 item (after tax) is being paid for with a one dollar bill. Well, the change for that is... wait for it... one penny. Sure, that is a specific example, but still, convenience. For reference, consumerism is still alive and well here in America. The penny, as it is now, is a medium of exchange, legal tender, for all debts, public and private, here in America. An announcement of an attempt at abolishing the penny would result in an uproar unless it coincided with a sporting event. The way the debate statement is phrased, abolishing the penny would cut down on the money supply a bit, but so would contractionary fiscal policy. We are paying 1.7 cents per penny for convenience. Sure, there are downsides, such as a bunch of pennies being really heavy, but they have machines like Coin Star* for that. You are paying for convenience when it takes 10% from your monies, but you can now get bills and nickels on up, and drop the penny in the chain's pet project charity of the week's box if you so desire. The term for such a thing is instant gratification. Another example of instant gratification from our daily lives is fast food, such as In-N-Out or McDonalds. You get your food very quickly, allowing you to resume your life sooner than if you went to a sit-down restaurant. There are those that would say, \"Hey, fast food is cheaper than sit-down.\" Yes, that is true. However, fast food can and does serve more customers overall, which means they can have lower prices, to attract more customers. Yet again, In-N-Out would be a prime example of this. A better example of instant gratification would be the one-day or two-day shipping options when shopping online. \"You want this thing? You want it now? Pay a little extra to get it!\" As far as I can tell, *This, and all the other examples given aren't advertising; I'm just using the examples I know. A very good question for those penny-punters (not pinchers) would be \"What then? Do all existing pennies become worth the alloys they are made of?\" Chances are, they just saw an example of waste and wanted to smite it, initiate sweeping reforms, and get a statue (made of smelted pennies or something pretentious yet awesome like that) somewhere. A buyback program would work... up until pennies don't show up in multiples of five. Would we round up or round down in such a case? If we round up, we're throwing money at people. If we round down, we're taking even more money from people. If we round up, the government loses in the short run, which is bad for the politicos, but good for the people. If we round down, it looks better on the balance sheet for that year, but a lot of people just lost a few pennies. Admittedly, people would probably lose less than they spend on a cup of coffee on any given day, but there would still be a bit of outrage, and outrage is bad for the incumbents. And now the rambling bit that I really should write better, but because of reasons, I only had twenty minutes to write this, because of a prior engagement that I should have remembered earlier that, fortunately, let out early. Wishing wells and/or the Uncomfortable Truths Well would have a lot more nickels, dimes, and quarters in them. We already have issues with fractions of cents. Don't make it worse by getting rid of the penny. It's easier to use a Coin Star, take it to the cashier, and deposit it in a savings account than it is to do a buyback. How much change do you have lying around that you won't find for a couple years? How long is the aforementioned buyback program in effect? Which way was it going again? Were they rounding up or down? Will it simply take place at a bank, or will there be specialized facilities? All of these are legitimate concerns. In conclusion, the penny is still a viable medium of exchange and store of value.

Taxation would have to be adjusted to a numerical value system based off of our remaining coins which are all multiples of fives, causing potential increases in how much and how we are taxed. Theoretically speaking, what would the cost for a cheap item with a tax of one cent be changed too? Would we just have no tax on it or would we just round up to five? It's a large amount of work to be done when there is another solution. Instead of simply \"stopping the production of pennies,\" I feel that we should change the materials of a penny or the size.

Just like much other older forms of currency, after production is stopped and less of the currency is around, the more valuable it becomes. The other solution I stated before is making the penny smaller. By doing this we won't be putting as much material into it, and less material equals less cost.", "qid": 45, "docid": "261deb04-2019-04-18T13:26:46Z-00004-000", "score": 6.529900074005127}, {"content": "Title: The United States should cease production of the penny Content: Much of this argument will be tied into convincing those who are reading, and can vote. But, like the penny those who cannot vote, still have a valued by opinion in this matter and can be counted by their comment. The penny\"s value is beyond its own self-evident worth it will be proved to be a reflection of our labor. The penny holds a liberty which serves and greater good and is worth in its added cost beyond face value. 1.The Penny is a part of an impartial system of measurement and as a part of the system it is expected to be held as part of its measurement and value. Not a just cost and value. When it shows a negative number by its own profit. It is a part of the overall machine showing wear or abuse in that system. The penny is simply just .0001% of a dollar. The measurement outside of its well-known value is a direct relationship to our method of keeping time. Its transposition is to the ten-thousands by volume. 2.The pricing of metal makes it profitable to harvest pennies out of an economy. The obligation behind all taxation is immediately to the United States Connotation Separation process. The removal of the penny means an instant pay raise for inappropriate spending. Spending which should have been going to safeguarding the harvesting of United States Private Property, its penny and the value by weight of metal. The pennies copper or metal is incapable of self-regulation. The Federal Reserve Note in line behind every penny most certainly has this ability. It only fails when squandered elsewhere. 3.The penny is an economic indicator to inflation it is part of a clock system. I have recently started argument that the national Debt Clock is indeed inaccurate. Part of the inaccuracy is how it aligns Debt spending by its lowest value. The mistake is in increments. The lower values in debt accurately run backwards as mentioned in my opening reason the penny has a negative transposition valued at Ten-Thousand. The hard thing to want to take is this measurement is for loss not profit. In the Axiom of GOD we TRUST, the reason for this somewhat obscure logic all people want to know about the possibility of loss first as an indication or warning. 4.The pennies worth for harvest was not always 1 cent it was driven by inflation. When the pennies is gone that means the nickel is next in the line of inflation driven harvesting. Instead of 1 cent it will be .05 cents which is taken. The Government has always operated by rounding up to the nearest .05 cents. To justify this action which can destabilizes an impartiality, how any-one can say this action of round up has improved cost is hiding the examples of its overall performance. After all the Governing body has been collecting four times more than the rest of the Nation and the rising spending provides us with a quarter or less in stability or progress.", "qid": 45, "docid": "35161051-2019-04-18T12:33:43Z-00002-000", "score": 6.529799938201904}, {"content": "Title: The Penny Should Die. Content: Hello. My name is AppleAddict439, and i thank the challenger for accepting this debate. Let\"s start in 1792, with the first U.S mint. Back then, pennies were made out 100% copper. There was no zinc in the actual penny. But, the market changed. The value of copper went up, and, due to inflation, the value of the penny went down. After that, the penny became almost completely zinc. Then, in 2006, the old pennies were found to have a value above 1 cent, so people began to melt them down to make a nice, tidy profit. Then Congress decided that pennies were actually worth something (they\"re not) and passed a law against melting U.S currency. So, let me get to the data. Math time! Each second, the U.S mint produces 1,040 pennies a second, 30 million pennies a day, and (as of 2016) produce 13,000,000,000 pennies each year. 13,000,000,000!!! But, for each cent we make, we lose a little bit of money due to the fact it takes (as of 2016) 1.5 cents to make 1 cent. Now, you may be thinking: \"Wow. really makes a difference. 0.5 cents lost for each penny. That\"s so much.\" Actually, if you thought that, you are partly right. It is so much. After 13 billion pennies were made this year, with 0.5 cents lost for each penny, that means that in 2016 we lost 6,500,000,000 dollars to the penny making franchise. Now, we could be using that money to fix U.S debt and the U.S deficit, but no. We have to make pennies. Pennies are bad for us and bad for the U.S economy because: Say you want to pay for a 20$ toy. That\"s 2000 pennies you have to carry around\" Pennies add, on average, 2.2 seconds to each cash transaction, which causes a 1 billion dollar loss in money each year due to productivity costs. If you want to spend your precious pennies, it will be hard. For example, vending machines, laundromats, tollbooths, parking meters, newspaper machines, or telescopes. Pennies, essentially are DEAD WEIGHT in cash transactions. So, there are probably the penny diehards who are listening to me reading this that are thinking: But\" It\"s never been done before! We\"ve never removed the penny, nor have others!\" Well, that\"s wrong. New Zealand, Finland, Australia, the Netherlands and Canada have removed their one cent coins or pennies. They now round to the nearest 5 cent. But- others say-we\"ll remove Lincoln! That would be oh no: UNPATRIOTIC. Well, Lincoln is still on the 5 dollar bill, and- get this: some military bases round to the nearest 5 cent. To put it simply in the words of CGP Gray: Pennies waste money, waste time, are a money fail, and are worth less and less each year due to inflation. And that's it.

Refutations to Refutations: Refutation 1: Minting Cost My esteemed colleague has stated that, as of 2011, it costs 2.41 cents to make a penny. However, I'd like to point out that they have cited a source from 2011. As of 2014, pennies only cost 1.7 cents to make, down 2.4 cents from 2011 (. http://blogs.wsj.com...). Therefore, the evidence shows that the amount it costs to make the penny is actually on the decline. Soon, it will not be much of a loss for the US to make it, meaning that there is not an adequate reason to abolish its use. Refutation 2: Debt \"Removing the penny is only good for debt\" is what Pro states. I strongly disagree as we will lose $600 million/year with the rounding system as earlier showed in my first argument. The United States' debt recently hit $18 trillion, and I believe Pro and I have a common interest in lowering that debt. However, the solution is not to take the penny out of service. Also, after this statement, Pro brings up a source and says that the US will save 7.6 trillion dollars/year without the penny, yet he/she fails to provide any reasoning behind this. It's just going to happen. .. somehow. .. I don't think so. Therefore, Pro's case has one more flaw. Refutation 3: Economical Harm Refutation My mistaken opponent stated that the penny will only affect cash transactions in response to my argument about economic harm. However, they have ignored a chunk of the argument in saying this since the source I stated about the $600 million a year being lost is talking about cash purchases. (Here's a link: . http://pennies.org...) Therefore, Pro simply danced around my argument instead of actually attacking it head-on. Refutation 4: Charities Refutation A contradictory statement made by Pro is \"The penny is the most donated coin,yet it can be quickly overshadowed by the nickel. \" This is like saying \"People like beef, but they'll like chicken better sooner or later. \" Therefore, It is a contradictory statement that cannot be proved. To expand on my charity point, pennies are better than nickels for donations since pennies are worth less, and, because of that, people donate more, which eventually becomes more money for the charities. If people donated nickels, they would be more stingy with how many they gave. Refutation 5: Canada \"We use\" and \"As a Canadian\" are two prime examples of phrases used by Pro that prove his/her misunderstanding of the topic. If I may reiterate, the topic is \"The US Penny Should be Taken out of Service,\" not \"The Canadian Penny Should be Taken out of Service. \" Pro fails to use any American examples and is under the delusion that the Canadian economy is exactly the same as the United States economy, proving another point for Con. Refutation 6: Burden I gave Pro a 3-pronged burden of proof and, so far, no prong has been fulfilled. Let's break them down individually. 1) The harm of the penny is sufficient enough to justify its removal from the market. Pro slightly dances around this by saying that it costs a lot to make a penny, but never follows through, and I have already taken this down earlier. 2) Taking the penny out of service will minimalistically harm the economy. Pro has not mentioned anything whatsoever about this prong. 3) Their plan is good enough to transition into this change smoothly with minimal harm and maximum benefit. Pro never even brings up a clear-cut plan. Sure, they mention things like \"the penny plan\" and \"the plan,\" but what is this plan? The world may never know, or at least not myself and the voters since Pro has not mentioned this. Here is a statement made by Pro: \"I do not agree with your terms as they where not originally outlined. As the instigator it is normally assumed that you have the burden of proving your point. It is up to the voters to decide who wins, not you. I will address your concerns to be a good sport. \" If he/she does not agree with my terms (they actually were originally outlined since the first round was for acceptance), then why didn't Pro attempt at refuting them? As an Instigator, it is assumed that I have the burden of proving my point. I already have proved my point, yet Pro has not proved his/hers since he/she has failed to meet his/her burden. I completely agree that it is up to the voters to decide, this burden is a mere aid for the voters, saying that if Pro does not have these three things, they can't win because their case is not sufficient to prove their assertions.

The United States's money is based on a basic cents system, with 1 cent being a unit. The value of the dollar has dropped nearly 80% in the last few decades, and prices have inflated to new highs. Very little can be bought with pennies, and yet they should not stop production, even at the cost of 1.8 cents per cent. Refutations: 1. Pennies cost 1.8 cents to make, which con points out is more then the penny is worth, but does not consider the value of repeat use, especially by something as durable as a penny. Estimates on how long a penny last range from 20-25 years, going through thousands of exchanges, each time adding value to the actual cost of producing the penny. In the end, the penny stimulates the economy far more than the 1.8 cents they cost, lasting 25 years compared to the dollar bill's 18 months of existence. (1) 2. While I disagree that paper money was to make things easier to buy, con is correct, little can be bought solely with pennies. Although I will go into it extensively later, paying with pennies is not their use, but instead is for reaching the exact cost of something. 3. Machines do not accept pennies, as they are not taxed and always round up to a clean number, something prices in stores would not do. As for their usefulness, I would argue that when one pays in cash, just as many or more pennies are exchanged then any other type of bill. Almost any price will come out with tax not a perfect five cent round. If something costs 4:53, you have to add an additional 3 cents, only payable with pennies. If you pay with a five dollar bill, then you will receive at least two pennies in change. There is nothing else you could make up that difference with. Arguments against: 1. If the penny was eliminated, it would make pricing things nearly impossible. Unless every price is rounded to a five cent mark, the only thing you can pay with cash is pennies. Add ever-changing tax to that cost, and it is almost impossible to price anything. Con claims he can refute this, which I will hold them to. I am yet to see a good refutation to this point, and I will be impressed if con has one. 2. Many charities work off pennies, either receiving all their donations or a large percentage of them from pennies alone. Such charities include Habitat for Humanity, World Wildlife Fund, and the Salvation Army. These charities and many more rely on pennies, because of people's willingness to part with pennies. (2) 3. The nickel's value has dropped just as much as the dollar and penny, are rarely used in purchase, and nickels cost 11.2 cents to produce. (3) Would you have them eliminated as well? What nonsense. No, nickels are similar to the pennies, and the arguments are valid for both. We work on a cent system, and eliminating the one cent and five cent are fiscally ridiculous. I will begin with this.

Yes I did admit that some would come out on top and some would come out on bottom, but by only a few cents each, nothing that would amount to 600 million in deficit even if people tried to save money this way. (see cbc link)Another issue we have bumped heads on is the use of outdated information. Any high school will tell you a report made by someone can be outdated if it is opinion based and if it is older then 10 years. My source from \"1992\" is not from 1992 as my opponent stated, It is from 2012 based off charity trends that existed since before 1992 till 2013. Their Source is an opinion based report published in 1990.Minting CostMy opponent brought up that the cost of a nickel is also higher then the cost of a penny. He/she assumes that if I say \"we should be getting rid of pennies\" I must make a case to get rid of nickels too. The simple fact is that nickels do not round the same as pennies, and we would have to do something about quarters too. It simply is not feasible to get rid of the nickel (yet). This does not undermine the savings that loosing the penny would would create. America would still be gaining back the cost of creating pennies wile not losing any more then planned on nickels. My opponent did not tackle the subject of a penny will never equal its cost to make, but simply said it decreased from 2011-2013. \"This money, this petty change, actually costs something to make\" The cost to make pennies each year is much, much more then petty change:\"This year, the Mint has spent more than $114 million to make pennies, compared with $83.7 million for nickels, $72.3 million for dimes and $133 million for quarters.\"It is an expensive coin! Overshadowing nickels and dimes all for what? To end up on the street. http://www.wsj.com...My opponents Forbes site does not say \"higher manufacturing value is actually a good thing\" it said it \"used\" to be a good thing. Today the government has standards and laws that prohibit the creation of money for no reason. We also have a harder time counterfeiting currency now then they used to during the original years of the country.Charities\"fails to back that statement as well as simply asserting that his/her quote is not contradictory without an explanation\". I did explain this one. Once again I said that a nickel will quickly over shadow a penny (5-1). Nickels are worth five times more, therefore the will overshadow a penny five times to one. My opponent then preceded to call me names (hypocrite) by saying my 2012 source was from 1992 and again forces the assumption that people will stop donating if there are no pennies.Canadian: we are in agreement.Waste of TimeCollecting: I am sure the mother and daughter, father and son who collect pennies will be much happier when their collection goes up in value due to the abolished of the penny in stores. Donations: The cancer patient has a good chance of survival due to other non penny donations. Your comparison is not correct, saying pennies are a waste of time is like saying a dog only has so many years, go play with him instead of rolling virtually useless coins. My opponent did not refute the actual dollar amount that every American will lose per year due to time wasted on pennies.Not Accepted for all Purchases. My opponent agrees with me but tries to make my point less valuable then a penny by saying it is a waste of time. I would like to explain with the example:wile you have to fumble in a change purse around 50 pennies (not accepted at a vending machine), you could have had two quarters in change (or ten nickels) and you could have gotten that bag of chips you wanted but now you are hungry and in a rush with pennies weighing you down. Vending machines are only getting better and more convenient, who knows when you will get your next snack craving.Bad for the Environment: \"Pennies are innocent.\" 18,000 metric tons of zinc are used per year to create pennies. Supply and demand dictates how much zinc they will dig up and therefore how much pollutants they will put out. Reducing the demand will reduce this environmental catastrophe that pennies are indeed guilty of helping to create.http://www.forbes.com...Thank you for reading. Thank you for debating.

Commercials are shown a lot in repetition, why? because when watching tv they can't determine if someone new turned to that same channel and didn't see the ad before. The reason the head on commercial repeats 3 times is its suppose to, the phrase was suppose to be the catchy slogan of the product. Well if it makes a customer wonder they might even guy it out of curiosity alone your thinking too much into it the general public doesn't think into commercials that much. Actually they wanna spend all their 1 minute to 30 seconds talking about how good their product is rather than wasting time on talking about the negative thats why they talk fast at the end. They will tell you what you would have to pay when you call them about the product. barely readable fonts? sounds like bank lone tricks not going to wall mart and buying a bag of lays or bounty paper towels. 2.The product usually don't work.... So you really couldn't find proof of these products not working im sorry but we can trust what you remember find a source saying these products don't work. Nor your experiences. Plus your little malfunction might have been how you were using or how you places the tube into the despenser sometimes its a user error. 3.Ads tend to benefit only large companies rather than the general public... Thats actually a very incorrect statement to tell people to stop buying stuff, in an economy such as the U.S we need money circulation, the reason the economy is so bad right now is there isnt enough money circulating. The whole idea is people spend money to a company then company employee's spend on other things expand and goes back out into the economy, however everyone is keeping their money not contributing to the circulation making it hard to do this. The stimulas package was suppose to help circulation, didn't work very well either. Buying products helps our companies survive allowing jobs to stay which paying employee's puts the money back into the economy and helps the economy without companies less jobs actually hurting the general public.", "qid": 45, "docid": "62e38fb7-2019-04-18T18:46:31Z-00001-000", "score": 6.309800148010254}, {"content": "Title: Convert the penny!!! Content: This is actually the response I expected. I am familiar with Robert Whaples' point of view, and I even read his article entitled \"Why keeping the penny no longer makes sense.\" But despite the viewpoints of Robert Whaples, Greg Mankiw, and a few others, the economy truly would suffer due to the elimination of the penny. In Whaples' article, he claims to have obtained data on \"nearly 200,000 transactions\" and states \"the number of times consumers' bills would be rounded upward is almost exactly equal to the number of times that they would be rounded downward.\" These words of \"nearly\" and \"almost\" accompanied by a complete lack of data make his view flaky at best. In reality, the rounding tax is not a myth. On the surface Whaples' claim may seem to hold water. But upon a deeper analysis we can find out why it is untrue. Currently we still have the penny, but even now due to the sales tax percentages, costs are being rounded up or down to the penny. Here's the problem: whenever a customer purchases an item that would end in a half a penny after tax, that item gets rounded up to the penny. One half lies exactly between being rounded up or down. Yet it gets rounded up every time. This may seem trivial, but such trivial percentages have allowed businesses like casinos to rake in a large portion of money. The mention of casinos may seem out of place, but the same principle with rounding pennies in convenience stores applies. The house (or the store in this case) has a small advantage since there are slightly more totals that will be rounded up rather than down. This effect insures that the stores come out on top. The effect is cumulative, just as most of the economists have claimed. Furthermore, when looking at the sales tax percentages we can see that this number of one half comes out even more often than expected from a random set of numbers. The tax percentages tend to end in eighths, quarters, or halves. This gives an even larger advantage, and studies done with common cash purchases has shown that somewhere between 60% and 93% of transactions would be rounded up. While the rounding tax and the devastation of the economy should be enough to dissuade others from eliminating the penny, it is not the only reason to save the penny. The people that have proposed this notion claim that prices would still be the same when it comes to payments by check, credit card, or debit card. Only cash paying customers would apparently suffer since there would be no more pennies. This means that the one cent unit of currency would still exist on paper. There would just be no tangible one cent pieces. Our current system uses the same units of currency on paper or in the form of tangible cash. So eliminating the penny would move one step closer to eliminating tangible currency. This may seem like nothing, but it can open up a huge can of worms. Once people become used to the idea of currency that only exists electronically, further steps in the same direction can be made. When every purchase by every person is made electronically, the items that each individual buys will be able to be tracked. This is not a good thing. The current president has already violated privacy rights by viewing all of the books that people read and check out of a library. Further rights can be violated when the government can track every purchase by every person. I saw that you are in favor of George W. Bush, but you should still acknowledge that privacy would be violated if every individual's transactions can be traced. Since you stated that you are also in favor of flag burning, I think you may understand the philosophical necessity of freedom and rights. On your profile it also states that you are against a flat tax. I am as well, because it would damage the lower class. Similarly, the rounding tax (which is NOT a myth, despite Robert Whaples' claim) would also adversely affect the lower class since they are the ones more likely to make purchases with cash rather than credit cards or checks. So the two reasons to save the penny are that the economy would suffer overall, and the movement towards an elimination of tangible currency is a step in the wrong direction.", "qid": 45, "docid": "f143e2ae-2019-04-18T19:44:22Z-00001-000", "score": 6.29640007019043}, {"content": "Title: In the US, pennies should be abolished.

It is the most precise way to control inflations rates.If you control inflation rates, you control prices.

This is money that could be spent much more effectively, like on public schools!

We make them because they help to even our money transactions. We can't just round everything to to nearest nickel, because then half of the products would be MORE expensive then before, therefore wasting cash as well.

(On my opponent's case): Their #5 argument is not proven correct. These issues by their own merit ceasing production of the penny, en though I will now move on to attack my opponent's case. This first part isn't an argument, and has no place 1:This argument makes no sense. My opponent claims that the penny is .0001% of a dollar, even though it is exactly 1% of a dollar. This argument also makes no claims as to why .0001% of a dollar is a good system for a coin. 2:My opponent claims that the money would be spent inappropriately elsewhere. First off, he supplies no reason why the money would go towards the wrong spending, so it is safe to assume that the money would be spent in equal percentiles of current tax distribution. Second off, the idea that money spent to produce spending would go to illegitimate spending is exactly wrong, because producing pennies is the exact illegitimate spending that my opponent warns against. This means that my opponent agrees spending money on the wrong things is bad, yet refuses to see he is arguing for one of those systems. 3:Yet again, my opponent claims pennies are better economic indicators than the Debt Clock without providing a source of evidence, merely asserting that this is true. Also, the Debt Clock was not a part of his original argument, which means that this is a new argument and not a defense for his older argument, showing that pennies are not good economic indicators. 4:My opponent claims that the nickel will be next, which is not his original argument here. On the contrary, his original argument was about increased cost in bulk purchases, which is false. Also, my opponent claims that nickels are .05 cents, even though they are 5 cents. My opponent finally claims that eventually the nickel will suffer the same fate, and at that point, it would be justified to remove it for the same reasons proven here today.

Content: For reader/voter convenience I will go in the same order my opponent does Cont. 1- In order for this response to have a chance to hold water, my opponent first must prove that the United States indeed has the resources necessary to grow enough food for the whole nation. Until my opponent gives proof of this, the food portion of the response must be ignored. If we do not have the facilities to do so, then importing food is certainly not a waste of money as it helps ensure the continuation of the nation. As far as the monuments go, the point of having them is to commemorate the various historical heroes of our country. My point is that we are paying extra money to keep the penny when there is no reason to keep it other than your suggestion of the benefit nostalgic value which I have shown not only to be outweighed by the harm of economic down-fall but that it in-fact does not exist. And as I showed in my first contention, the penny is NOT a small waste of money. Cont. 2- My opponent forgets that the other half of products would go down in his hypothetical situation. However, this is not a viable situation unless stores never changed pricing strategies, sales tax would be eliminated, and people never bought more than one item, all of which randomize rounding. In fact, a recent study(http://www.wfu.edu...) confirms that the effect of rounding would be neutral. Cont. 3- Here my opponent drops that we would lessen our dependence and that that would be beneficial, thus those points stand. He goes off into an illogical point that we would become more dependent on countries making the ingredients for other coins. I ask how is it possible that lowering the need of zinc heightens the need for other metals. Cont. 4- I am sorry, there has been some misunderstanding. When I said the penny has no value, I meant nostalgic value. The stat with 58% saving and the germ reference were simply to point out that people think so little of the penny that they not only put them away rather than keep to spend them but germs actually become a bigger part of the decision of whether or not to pick up a penny off the ground than the value of the penny, actual or nostalgic. (Besides that money \"poured back\" into the economy would just raise inflation.) Last paragraph- Please note I never said that the penny would be THE reason for an economic recession, just a contributor. My opponent concludes by saying that the amount of debt grows \"THOUSANDS of DOLLARS, not by pennies.\" Considering that I have proven that the penny costs us BILLIONS of dollars and this has remained uncontested, this only strengthens my argument.

I actually never talk about any net benefit regarding consumer confidence. The only thing I mention in 1A is that it costs way too much to produce. 2. Even the German Finance Ministry can only say that confidence in the Euro \"might\" decline as a result of not producing a penny. Education could easily combat this, assuming the risk even exists. Furthermore, the movement to eliminate the penny in the U.S. is well-documented, as indicated in the sources cited in the Pro case. Introducing a penny piece and taking away a penny piece that has been accepted by a vast majority of a society as useless are two entirely different scenarios. Pro Contention 1A: Counterplan 1. Of course, the more sensible solution would be to eliminate such a useless coin entirely, which is the only way to actually save all that money I talk about in my 1st contention. I am the only side that can maximize effective usage of resources. 2. What the counterplan does not address at all is the cost of pennies within a transaction. If we keep pennies, we still waste $10 billion in the transaction process if we keep pennies of any material. 3. My opponent proposes a nebulous, abusive counterplan. What material does he propose we use? I can't adequately refute it if I don't know the text. For example, if he picks another metal that is similarly controlled by a foreign market, he bites every harm in my 2nd contention. Just replace \"China\" with the name of another country. If he picks a metal that is marketed primarily in the U.S. (good luck finding one of those that another foreign market can't beat us at in price, as this is the problem with zinc in the first place), then a whole other host of practicality concerns would surface. However, I can't address any of them because my opponent is being overly vague. Pro Contention 1B: Cash Transactions Are Actually Cheaper 1. Cheaper than what? 2. Though the cost of receiving a cash transaction is less expensive to store profit than checks, debit cards, or credit cards, it does not at all follow that the use of pennies isn't increasing this cost. Yes, your 1st source states that a single cash transaction costs a store around 7 cents per transaction. However, my analysis of 2-2.5 cents wasted is not contradicted anywhere in your source. This debate compares cash transactions with and without pennies, not cash transactions to other kinds of transactions. Pro Contention 1B: NACS \"Report\" 1. You should know the NACS website quite well by now, since you cited the statistic in the first place. 2. Never claimed it was a report. 3. The statistic I use is cited by my first source from RD 1. Front page. CTRL \"F\" Walgreen. Pro Contention 2: Cross-Apply Counterplan 1. Cross-apply my vagueness analysis on the counterplan. We could very easily have the exact same problem, but my opponent refused to name an alternative material. Pro Contention 2: Bright-line for China Dependency 1. Sure can. As of January 2009, China had bought more than $1 Trillion of U.S. total debt [1]. Considering total U.S. debt is around $12 Trillion [2], and considering that China is the world's third most powerful economy, they represent a gigantic piece of our power struggle pie. If this were Mexico or something, I wouldn't be raising as much of a fuss (at least, not in terms of sheer capital power), but China is already a top world superpower contender. Furthermore, China is the second largest foreign owner of the US Treasury. Though they are slightly behind Japan in terms of foreign investment, I'd say that China is a far greater risk to the US than Japan will ever be, especially considering that their economy is improving, while ours is, in comparison, stagnating. They've become leaders in the global economic recession. We haven't. Pro Contention 2: China & Human Rights 1. Of course we have no pull right now. We've been obligated to China for quite some time now, and what's the incentive for China to bend to US pressure when we have no foreign policy leverage? Reducing trade and debt commitments to China clearly gain benefits for the sole reason that we stop giving some amount of money to China. =============== Neg Case: =============== Neg Contention1: 1. Do some math with me. Lombra predicts a $600 million round tax per year. I am going to assume that my opponent made a grammatical error when he said \"paid by each consumer,\" as I doubt each individual will pay $600 million a piece. I estimate that $10 billion is wasted by the consumer each year in penny transactions alone, not including the $50 million lost by the consumer in the production process. $10 billion > $600 million. I save the consumers more money. Neg Contention 2: 1. Inflation will occur with or without the penny, so until my opponent can give decent analysis on actual inflation, and not just an increase in government spending which is not explained well at all, this is a wash. 2. The author of his source admits that \"the inflationary impact of rounding will probably be small.\" Furthermore, the $2 billion in spending my opponent refers to was a projection for 2010 in the even that the penny was eliminated at the time of publication. That number is in no way representative of consequences within the current economy. Neg Contention 3: 1. The NACS also suggested a slight raising of prices in order to off-set the 30% profit loss. Keep in mind that this is 30% of 6-7 cents. That's not much to off-set, now is it? 2. Furthermore, the elimination of the penny, which would save 2-2.5 cents per cash transaction, would make up for this 30% loss. 3. Cross-apply my response to Con's 1st contention. $10 billion > $600 million. Until he can prove that we will spend more as consumers, as business owners, and as a government eliminating pennies than keeping them, you are still gaining more net financial benefit by voting Pro. 4. Considering current societal trends, the theft argument is outdated and relatively unwarranted. First of all, card transactions are becoming exponentially more preferable for the consumer. Despite Lombra's assertions otherwise, firms are not discouraging card usage at all. Think about the last merchant you visited that refused to take debit, Visa, or Mastercard. Furthermore, merchants are not being stopped from using change all together\u2014just the penny. The likelihood of carrying pennies vs. carrying any other change hasn't been established at this point, but if card transactions are becoming increasingly preferred, the likelihood of carrying any change is getting worse and worse, which means I probably won't even bite these harms.

Content: ~~~ SIDE EFFECTS ~~~ At Grace Amazing Hospital Penny Zillion's a doc. She helps in the infirmary, for jail down the block. A prisoner became enraged and injury seemed nigh. The guards asked her to inject him, else they would give a try. Penny is not an enforcer, she will not stand for pain. But if she helps or she does not, will greater harm obtain? Penny Zillion has a medical practical at Grace Amazing Hospital and helps out in the local prison infirmary. One day she is asked to give a tranquilizing injection to an unruly prisoner. Penny feels that her job is to care for patients, not participate in their punishment. She believes that if she does not inject the prisoner, the latter will be roughly handled and some guards may also be injured. Round 1 Reasoning Mill might urge Penny to do as she pleases as long as that does not harm others. A tranquilizer administered by a medical professional is unlikely to harm the prisoner. Rough handling by the guards, even if only attempting to retrain him, poses the greater possibility of harm. Since prisoner and some guards could conceivably be injured in the process of restraint, Mill's principle of acting to produce most happiness for the most people further supports Penny in injecting the prisoner. Kant might raise a tangential concern. We are to respect ourselves and others. The prisoner has rights. Does administering a tranquilizer disrespect the prisoner or even disrespect Penny by placing her in a compromising position? To answer affirmatively goes too far. This is not a matter of policy. It is situational use of medical restraint given an unruly prisoner and concern for the welfare of the prisoner and the guards. Furthermore, Penny is free to make up her own mind; she is not a pawn of the prison staff. And as a hospital physician, she certainly would rule out adverse reactions or other issues of medical history. No, the Kantian concern for disrespect or being used by others does not pertain.

Due to the rising, and risen, costs of metal, minting change is more expensive than ever. A Jefferson nickel costs almost 8 cents to mint and the Lincoln penny about 1.25 cents. Normally, the government makes profit by minting money (seigniorage), paying production cost and recieving face value. But, in the case of nickels and pennies, the government lost almost $100 million dollars alone in 2007. So, a simple remedy is to stop minting the Jefferson nickel, and make the Lincoln penny worth five cents. This not only saves the 3 cent and .25 cent loss for every nickel and penny minted, but creates a profit gap where the new Lincoln nickel makes the government 3.75 cents per coin.

We abolished the one cent coin ages ago. In fact, we've abolished everything beneath the ten cent. That means you can lose up to five cents on each purchase, assuming that shops do round fairly (they never do - it's usually more like 9 cents per purchase) by not using physical money. That might only add up to twenty cents a day (assuming maybe ten purchases), but that's $67 a year. In the US, currency is somewhat more valuable than in New Zealand, but still $67 is quite a considerable sum of money. The international banking system is based around the cent. When you transfer money, whether locally, at POS, or internationally, a fixed number with exactly two decimals is used to describe how much is being transferred. Even if pro abolishes physical pennies, the value of currency that pennies represent will continue to exist. The net effect is that card payers pay the exact price, and penny payers pay two cents too many or too few each time. And here's the problem - remember how we said right at the start that money needs to have an \"agreed upon value\"? And how pro was claiming that anything that prevents money from having an agreed upon value will be failing to fulfil the purpose of currency? Well here his own model clearly gives each good not one \"agreed upon value\", but two - one value for those who pay with one form of cash transfer, and another for those who choose to use a different mode of cash transfer. The harm here is that without an agreed upon value, you can't have a standard of value and thus no stable economy (. http://www.investopedia.com...). Not that the US economy is currently a bastion of stability, but this can only compound that issue. If pennies were really that useless, consumers wouldn't accept themHow many times have you gone to a shop and seen somebody refuse to take their change because they claimed it wasn't worth their while to pick it up? Consumers are not dumb. They support pennies (. http://www.pennies.org...), by and large, because they want to have pennies. They provide some value, otherwise they have no obligation to accept them. But they do. There is demand for the penny. Like pro doesn't see the point in pennies, I don't see the point in bottled water. If you have a safe water source conveniently already in your kitchen, why not use it? But that's no reason to abolish it, because other people clearly do see the value, and it's not doing me any harm for them to drink it. In the same way, it's no reason to abolish pennies, other people clearly like them, and there is no harm to pro if other people accept them. The model is pretty hastily thought throughYou know what will cost more than all the pennies are worth? Collecting them all up. It's a huge deadweight loss since it doesn't actually provide any real economic benefit. And then what? So the treasury has this big pile of coins, are they going to sell them to Walt Disney for a new Scrooge McDuck set? Just dumping that much metal is not exactly a great idea for the environment or anybody. And all the cost that the US has paid in making the coins will have gone to waste forever. They Cost More Than They Are WorthIf you read pro's own source #1, you'll note that Obama changed the Fed's secret recipe for minting coins so that the numbers pro cites are now all wrong. This problem has already been solved and it didn't require the abolition of the penny. The \"Coin Modernization, Oversight & Continuity Act\" provides that the treasury has to keep looking for new ways to drive down this cost still further. On the other hand, changing the factors of production in favor of other coins actually works out to be more expensive for the country as a whole (. http://www.pennies.org...). Sure those coins are worth more, but it also means you have to pay more - and with US money becoming relatively less scarce as more is made, you lose out in the end. Opportunity CostOpportunity costs of earning are not realised in spending. Sure, it might take twice as long to earn a penny at the checkout than at your job, just like you can probably buy a TV much faster than you can earn the money to buy one (unless you work for, say, Panasonic). That's normal, and it's OK, because to be an opportunity cost they would actually need to compete for the same time. News flash, those two seconds are probably not going to get you to work any faster, and if you arrived to your work two seconds early your greedy boss is too lazy to fill out all the accounting to give you two seconds of overtime. The marginal two seconds spent at the checkout are therefore not time lost that you could be earning something at your job. Moreover, it's not the same penny - one is change, the other income. Inefficiency in one aspect of a product, in this case the handling, does not really justify the abolition of this product, but even if it did pro has failed to show any kind of real opportunity cost. UselessThis was my opponent conjecturing that the opportunity cost was so big, nobody could be bothered emptying their piggy banks any more. I'm not sure how wealthy my opponent is, but as I understand it, jobs in the US remain scarce, poverty remains a problem, and piggy banks are so dry of funds that I wouldn't be surprised if the national meteorological service declares a nationwide drought tomorrow. Absolutely people are digging into their piggy banks. That's probably because you guys have just come out of a depression. In time, businesses will naturally begin rounding their prices due to inflationary pressures making pennies less cost-effective for them to calculate. At the point where pennies can no longer be spent, then perhaps there might be a case for them being useless. Since pennies can still be spent, however, they have a use, and are therefore useful.

The value of copper went up and inflation made the Penny worth less. So the mint was forced to make penny with less and less copper, until only 5% of it was made of copper. In 2006 the value of older pennies rose over one cent, so pennies were worth more dead then alive. People started melting pennies to sell there copper for profit. In a better efficient, rational world that would have been it for the penny, the american government would have realized there not worth minting and would have been happy there citizens were making profits. Instead copper melting became illegal and we kept making pennies. .. Argument 1 (bad for the economy)We manufacture 4 million Pennies each year even though it cost more to make the penny then the penny is worth. It costs 1.8 pennies to make one Pennie. So 1.8cents = 1 penny. Pennies are bad for the economy and add debt every year. Argument 2 (Pennies are impractical and unneeded) the whole point of paper money is that it's easier to buy things with. Imagine buying twenty dollars worth of stuff with 2000 pennies. The penny's worthlessness will continue to get worse, meaning that it will just continue to get more impractical to buy things with pennies. Back in the olden day pennies could by things, not anymore the penny is not capable of buying anything anymore. Argument3 (Pennies are a waste of time) not a single machine accepts pennies not soda machines, news paper dispensers, vending machines, laundry machines, toll booths or parking meters because there just not worth the time to add and collect them.

Content: So, to round up the beginning of your argument, the term I should be using is offshoring, not outsourcing. But in my defense, the terms are used interchangeably nowadays. And I while I did say that only the top tier remains in the country in my scenario, I also pointed out my scenario was also intentionally oversimplified. It's impossible to include every variant of outsourcing in an 8,000 character limit. The point remains, however, that every time a group offshores, there are less jobs in whatever country they were based in, and that the money used to pay the foreign workers' wages is lost to the sending country's economy. Which, for our argument, is really all that matters. Just who loses jobs is largely irrelevant. The problem is, though, that you're looking at things in the short term. Provided, your predictions go maybe ten to twenty years into the future, but I'm looking a little further. I'll show you what I mean. As you rightly state, the country we offshore to receives a great deal of money from us. But if you look at the planet as a whole, there is only a finite amount of wealth to go around. It can be either money, or resources, or both, but at the end of the day, it's limited. From there it follows that when we give money to other countries, we have less. Regardless of how we move it around, whether prices of products go down, whether we invest in stocks, whether we get jobs elsewhere in the country, there's still going to be that massive drain on the economy, and on the US as a whole. And while our money gets other countries richer, we get poorer. It follows that unless we export as much as we import, we're eventually going to drive ourselves into a depression. And the US currently manufactures very little. In fact, for the most part our only exports are the raw materials that we send to foreign countries to be made into our own goods. We're also not going to be doing much exporting because, for the most part, other countries are doing just fine for themselves. American labor is expensive, so our goods wouldn't be any cheaper than theirs, and it seems a bit pointless to manufacture goods for export to support our purchases of imported goods anyway. In the scheme of things, it makes more sense for us to safeguard ourselves against other countries' economic troubles by manufacturing our own goods. If we depend on exports to fund our imports, then we run the risk of economic failure should the country we export to stop buying our goods. And of course if we depend on China for our goods and they have a civil war, we risk economic failure. For the most part, you're looking at employment, which is certainly an issue, but the fact remains that no matter how we shuffle money around, there's less every year. As there's less money in circulation, wages drop or we just print more and inflation goes up. But by some point, no matter how low prices drop, there's going to be a point where no one can afford to buy products. Or inflation will spin out of control with largely the same result. Take your pick, really. But that isn't to say that employment isn't important anyway. Put simply, only so many people can be employed as public servants, and it doesn't take nearly so many people to man a ship as it does to staff a factory. Unemployment is still going to be an issue. But even if we have more jobs for the time being, we're just stalling the inevitable. \"Also note that the increased purchasing power of the foreign workers count: there is no reason to assume that they won't spend part of their extra income on foreign goods.\" So far, this one sentence is your only argument against the fact that offshoring is a drain on the economy. No offense intended, you've been focusing on employment instead. But anyhow. There's two reasons that won't work. The first is that we don't export goods to the countries we import from. They can't put money back into our economy if there's nothing to buy now, can they? Secondly, even if we do export to other countries more, so does everyone else. And I think you'll agree that most of the money we pay foreign workers will be spent on local things. So we're after the remainder. However we're competing with every other country selling product to our target consumers for that remainder. Needless to say, we won't get much of it. However, when we pay American consumers, nearly all that money would be spent on American goods (provided we actually produce any ourselves) and would stay relatively contained in our economy, where it would circulate around supporting everyone. Which is a much better system, in my opinion. \"Indeed, no wage drop. One of the causes is that there is that the economic boost (explained above) creates new jobs, hence keeps the demand up, the offer of labor doesn't change, hence the wages stay the same.\" Great. But as I proved, the US has less wealth to pay those wages with, so inflation just goes through the roof instead. And US would have less jobs as a whole anyway, which would drive wages down a little. But probably not enough to compensate for the inflation. At any rate, same argument as before, eventually we can't afford to buy the goods these corporations are trying to sell us. Not all labor is moved to foreign countries because some jobs necessarily have to remain in the US. The \"top tier\" from my original argument does, certain groups have to remain to keep everything running smoothly, jobs that physically require people to be in the US have to stay here. \"Main one is productivity: foreign labor has a low productivity compared to the Western countries.\" As far as I know, this is not true. The countries we offshore to have no legal obligations to not establish sweatshops or to have fair workdays. Additionally, in most cases, workers are paid by the product and not by the hour, which keeps productivity up. Regardless, productivity isn't even an issue when the labor is that cheap. The only time productivity is important is to weigh how much is costs to hire workers against how much work they can do. Even if productivity is low, if wages are low, you can hire many more workers and still get productivity up to par while paying less. Quality is also a bit of a nonissue. Since our governmental quality controls are essentially gutted we're left to the free market to determine quality. If there's no one with better quality and comparable prices, then there's no one worth competing with. And because it's so much more expensive to maintain any semblance of quality, those companies can't compete. I'll give you transport, but transport is comparatively cheap and is not much of an issue for these corporations. As for other costs, building factories and exporting materials are about the only things we need to worry about. We don't build up reputations or pay compensations to workers. That's why foreign labor is so cheap. And the private sector has everything to do with government. The government spends because of what the private sector does. Companies outsource. People lose jobs. The government has to pay unemployment to them now, increasing the national debt. Also, if there's less money in circulation, there's less to tax and less to pay it with. And I never said we should completely ban offshoring, because as you suggest, it's fairly impossible. What I do suggest is severely limiting it. All you have to do is set a minimum wage. If you said that all American companies have to pay the American minimum wage to workers, regardless of where they are, it would solve your problem pretty neatly. Without cheap labor, employers would come back to the US. If there's a shortage of labor, we can still hire overseas. As for offshoring by outsourcing, require the same thing of companies that your companies get involved with.

Thank you for participating in your own debate. If the viewing audience would take a close look at what my opponent has written down, you may notice the same thing I have. She has attached as a true value for coins not what the department of treasury denotes them, but rather their true worth is reflected in the cost it takes to make them. For a penny, normally worth 1.000 cents, she points out it cost 0.0126 cents to make it so making a penny is a net gain of 0.9874 cents. Then she goes on to tell us that it takes even less than that to make the coins that are worth more in the eyes of the department of treasury. Ergo even greater net gain. Perhaps the source she gave actually conveys something different, that the net gain in making a dime is less than the net gain you make in making a penny, but since my opponent clearly failed to articulate that and by some accident articulated the opposite meaning, she should lose this debate. Plus my opponent has completely ignored my case that I have been making every single round that money only has the value it does under certain conditions. When disaster strikes your area candles, flashlights, generators, fresh bottled water and guns become worth there wait in gold. When everything hits the fans and we are forced to find what any worth there is in these two coins you see that because dimes are more sturdy and harder, it takes less to fill a bag full of coins that you can hit people with like a club to defend yourself. My opponent has also never addressed my point that you cant pay the cashier with .0126 cents, they will laugh at you when you try. You have to save all your .0126 cents until you have enough to make a hole cent that you can exchange them for, because a completely made penny is the lowest value that any commercial vendor will accept. Since you cannot lose lower than one cent values they virtually have no value until they become a whole cent, and once a whole coin the dime clearly stands out over the penny. Plus, my opponent did not specify we refer to only dimes made recently with FDR on them. We must be talking about all dimes and pennies. The best penny that is worth the most would be made with real copper, but the best dime would be made with real silver. Melted down the dime is worth more, cause silver is worth more than copper. http://www.bellbookandcandle.biz... So lets refresh my four argument. 1) my opponent conveyed her argument so poorly that if you didn't read her source you would be convinced dimes are worth more. 2) When people stop valuing money dimes serve better as make shift club than pennies 3) People only accept whole cents now a day's, so the denoted value on the coin is all that we care about or believe in. 4) My opponent has obviously been referring to her penny that she pulled out of her pocket, it was minted last year its not worth much, and the dime in question is obviously supposed to be mine and mine is a factory mint condition silver dime that predates the FDR dime. It's worth way more than a 10 cents now. And very much more than her penny. I don't owe my opponent cheetos, but I believe you owe me your 2-cents.

(Kleptin Tourney) Content: Okay, man, it has been a while since I've done this. I thank Kleptin for organizing this tournament, and alto2osu for this debate challenge. Without further ado, let us begin (As a brief roadmap, I will go down my opponent's case before my own). Interpretation- This is a reasonable interpretation, and the one I intended when I originally made the debate. Thus, I agree and there is no clash here. 1a. I cannot deny the cost of zinc in the world. However, alto2osu makes it seem like the discontinuation of pennies is the only action to take, with the net benefit of public confidence in the economy through reform. However, we can see that the elimination of the one-cent piece would actually LOWER consumer confidence, as the German Finance Ministry stated for the introduction of the one-cent euro piece [1, page 8]: \"If a euro one-cent coin were not introduced, public opinion might regard this as a sign of weakness in the euro and confidence in the stability of the common European currency might suffer as a result\" Also, this is not the only option to solve this problem. At the point where the cause of this cost is from the metal it is made from, primarily zinc, we can see that it is much more beneficial to accept the following counter-plan: \"The United States should change the metal that pennies are made out of\". Not only does this solve my opponents first point, but it has the net benefit of avoiding the harms of the negative case that is to come. 1b. Again, while the case my seem to be against the penny, the actual cost of a cash transaction comparatively is not the wasteful picture my opponent paints. When stores calculated the cost of each transaction (in time, armored courier costs, etc.), they found that cash transactions, including those with pennies, were the cheapest by FAR, whether it be per item, or in total transactions [1, page 6] Also, I searched for this report by the NACS that you claimed, but I could not find it. I'm not saying you are lying, but could you please give the source? 2 First, cross-apply the counter-plan. If the penny is not made out of zinc, we don't have this \"problem\". Secondly, we must see that even if this sale happens, we do not become more \"indebted\" to China. This is simply one company selling itself off. Ok, we don't have the world's biggest deposits of zinc. Therefore it makes sense we are not the biggest producers; this is not apocalyptic , just common sense. \"We are already far too indebted to other nations, especially China, to be able to operate freely within the world economy.\" Can you prove this? Where is the bright-line between us being able to operate freely and not operate freely? On human rights, we already have NO influence on China in the issue of human rights, nor do private businesses as shown with the recent tiff between China and Google. In fact, China shot back at the US calling the US hypocrites for criticizing China.[2] Neg case (other than impact turns): 1 Direct Impact. If one were to get rid of the penny, obviously one would have to round prices to the nearest nickel. While seemingly insignificant, this causes a huge price to be paid. Due to the disproportionate amount of items ending with 9 and certain other numbers [1 page 3], a $600 million \"round tax\" as Lambra calls it, would be paid by each consumer yearly simply because of this rounding. If we are going to talk economic impacts, this forced extra spending that does not actually produce benefit is simply going to leave consumers with less disposable income, meaning less spending which means a slower recovery if not another recession. 2 Long-term-Inflation. Long term impacts do not look any better. The rounding that would occur would negatively affect governmental spending. Using data from the congressional budget office, Lambra calculates that government spending would be up by 2 billion JUST by this rounding. Note that this was is 2001, when the economy was actually good and our spending was not that high. With the higher spending we have today, the artificial rise would just be that much greater. 3 Stores- Finally, we can look to the affect on stores. After taking into account the fact that cash transaction is the cheapest transaction to make, we can see that this rounding would run stores out of buisness. At a 1998 convention, the NACS stated that the average profit per transaction is about 6-7 cents [1 page6] Thus, a two-three cent rounding would take about 30% of a store's profit basically kicking someone while they are down. Also we can look to the threat deterrence of pennies. Without pennies, exact change is more likely to be had. At that point, the register does not have to be opened to procure change and the employee can just pocket the money. With pennies, this is MUCH less likely to happen. For all these reasons, I urge a vote in negation. 1: http://college.holycross.edu... 2: http://www.reuters.com...", "qid": 45, "docid": "5c2fb364-2019-04-18T19:07:11Z-00004-000", "score": 6.059999942779541}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: an infirmary doctor should tranquilize an unruly prisoner.

This causes the store, and ultimately the government (since it collects taxes), to lose money, nullifying your saving money argument. It also has an important flaw: sales tax would still need to be added to the price. Let us still consider the McNuggets as $1.22. In Maryland, the sales tax is $0.06. Even if you rounded to the nearest nickel, the total would be $1.26, and still not be able to provide exact change without a penny. Even if the tax was added first and then the price was rounded, this defeats the purpose of a state-imposed sales tax, effectively making the nationwide sales tax $0.05. Not only does this interfere with a state's sales tax policy, but it also can decrease the government revenue even further. Due to these complications, the government would not gain enough, if any, of a benefit from abolishing the penny, and would interfere with a state's right to impose a sales tax.

If we adopt the plan, thats an extra $150 million dollars in the government's pockets that isn't adding to the deficit. Not to mention the fact that adopting the plan would be intrinsically profitable, making money instead of losing it, since the Lincoln nickels would be worth more than cost. Your second objection is that we need pennies for transactions etc. But, transactions are already rounded. When you buy gas, the price per gallon isn't $3.59, but $3.599. Thats what that miniature number farthest to the right on the sign means. So, rather than rounding off tenths of cents, we would be rounding off full cents. Some argue this would lead to a 'rouding tax' where buyers are robbed of pennies on every transaction. But, a study was conducted, and simple logic would show, that out of the countless transactions performed everyday, there are an even number of transactions that would round up and round down, leaving the monetary advantage null.

I'm sorry this wasn't very clear, and as such I will not address the definition in that context again and will refrain from using that part of it in the debate. Section 1: Content of the USD PennyThe argument about the zinc industry as a whole is not a fair argument, particularly when considering my opponent's suggestion for reforming the penny. If one was to agree with my argument, that would mean no further production of the penny. However, if someone was to side with my opponent, it would mean reforming the penny's composition to reduce the cost. .. which would mean using significantly less zinc. This essentially renders my opponent's argument null and void. \"These providers of zinc and copper would lose contracts worth tens of millions of dollars every year if such pennies ceased new production. \" \"It is true that such rising zinc prices have increased the price of the penny, but there is no reason why the composition of the penny cannot be revisited as a way to cut down on costs on production, without having to cut the coin all together. \"I would also like to see a source that shows that cutting the penny would cost this much for copper and zinc producers. If this is true, perhaps it would make it easier for producers to focus on more useful zinc and copper products than the penny, such as galvanization for the former and wiring for the latter, as well as various other practical uses [1][2]. If this cannot happen, then this is simply an unfortunate side effect of a capitalist society moving forward in time. This sounds harsh, but let me ask: why don't we see people building cars in assembly lines as much as we see robots doing it? Why are deliveries from milkmen so rare nowadays? And why did Kodak tear down numerous buildings and fire thousands of people when they didn't get enough sales in the paper and film industry (and wrongfully believed there was still a big business in it)? It's because we no longer see a use for these things or have a use for them. The penny will similarly have to go. Section 2: Use (Or Lack Thereof)Of course, this is not just an issue of what we make the penny out of, but it is also an issue of the penny's low buying power. The penny costs more to make than it's worth, which, as one of my commenters has pointed out, is not a valid argument in and of itself, considering currency is frequently used and is thus ultimately worth more than its face value. That being said, we've been using the penny so infrequently that it's costing the US around $900 million each year [3]. They're very unworthy of our time. In fact, in the time it takes for people to take out pennies or even pick them up, the average American earns more than one cent [3][4]. These same issues of low buying power do not apply to the $1-$100 bills, and as such it would be wise to keep them and find a new way to make them. The fact that the penny costs so much to make would just be an added bonus for getting rid of it, but it's not the main one. We got rid of the half penny back when it had buying power that would take eleven cents today [4] because it wasn't realistic to keep it with such a low buying power. It only seems logical, then, for the penny to follow suit.

And not only this, this debate has been won by the Con side throughout various times in our nation's history. There exist many jobs in the zinc and zinc-related industries that produce these pennies, as well as transportation jobs in relation to delivering pennies to various institutions. By ceasing the production and minting of the penny, we see many of these jobs that would be otherwise lost. These providers of zinc and copper would lose contracts worth tens of millions of dollars every year if such pennies ceased new production. In 1982, these pennies were made from brass, and were also engaging in a higher production cost. However, in this year, zinc was used to provide 97.5% of the composition of the penny, with the thin copper plating on the outside of the coin. Initially this saved the government millions of dollars, but we have seen recently the rising prices of zinc. It is true that such rising zinc prices have increased the price of the penny, but there is no reason why the composition of the penny cannot be revisited as a way to cut down on costs on production, without having to cut the coin all together. Hypothetically, if the cost of ink and paper exceeded $1, would we eliminate the dollar? If it exceeded $100, would we tell all the Benjamin Franklin enthusiasts that his likeness and portrait will be less commonplace? Of course not, as there are many materials that can be made to provide coins and currency, and the re-visitation of such denominations is a sufficient way to address such concerns. As another example, in 1943, the Mint produced pennies made of zinc-coated steel to conserve copper for military use, yet we still kept the penny as a valid denomination.

Content: Tim Wu, the guy who coined the term \"net neutrality,\" notes the importance of \"differentiat[ing] sharply between the principle of network neutrality and a network neutrality law.\" This debate isn't about the principle of net neutrality. This debate is about whether the US should adopt a net neutrality law. I'm not arguing against net neutrality as a principle. I'm arguing that the US shouldn't adopt a net neutrality law. Con's arguments are aimed against banning net neutrality. I agree with Con that banning net neutrality is bad for competition and small businesses. There is no debate there. The debate here is whether net neutrality should be required, not whether it should be banned. 1. Con says \"net neutrality stimulates competition\" because, \"if we ban net neutrality the big ISPs ... would be able to block competitor's websites. That way the big companies would be unable to compete with each other because people could not access more than one big service without paying more, and therefore there would be no need for competing.\" First, as discussed above, this debate isn't about banning net neutrality. Con's argument doesn't support adoption of a net neutrality law. Con's argument only supports the status quo -- allowing net neutrality but not requiring it. I agree with Con that banning net neutrality would be bad for the economy. What I argue for is less regulation, not more regulation. A ban on net neutrality, like a net neutrality requirement, is more regulation. Either way, that's bad for the economy. What we need is less government intrusion on the Internet, as I explained in the previous round. Second, the idea that ISPs can block competitor's websites without a net neutrality law is incorrect. As I explained in the last round, the antitrust laws prohibit anticompetitive business practices, including such discriminatory behavior that harms competition and consumers. Take a look at the Wikipedia for a brief summary of the antitrust laws: http://en.wikipedia.org.... Section 2 of the Sherman Act doesn't allow companies to harm consumers or competition by using their monopoly power to raise prices or exclude competition. Third, Con's claim that \"big companies would be unable to compete with each other\" is false, even if we did ban net neutrality, as there would still be many ways for companies to compete with each other. Pricing, Internet speed, Internet reliability, types of discrimination, geography -- all these would still be open to competition. To be clear, I'm not saying we should ban net neutrality. I'm just saying Con is wrong that banning net neutrality would make it impossible for companies to compete. 2. Con says \"if we ban net neutrality internet providers will be able to pick which sites show up first, and ban or block websites that they don't want their customers to see.\" As a result, Con argues, \"small businesses will not be top priority on these providers' lists and may even be banned, therefore leaving them unable to get off the ground.\" First, again this debate is not about banning net neutrality. Con argues against banning net neutrality, and I agree with Con that banning net neutrality is bad for small businesses. Con's arguments actually support my point, which is that more regulation harms the economy and small businesses. I argue for less regulation -- no net neutrality law, either requiring net neutrality or banning net neutrality. Second, in the absence of a net neutrality requirement, ISPs can offer customers faster or slower lanes of traffic. As I explained last round, this is good for competition, as it gives incentive to create faster lanes for which ISPs can charge higher prices. Prohibiting ISPs from discriminating in procompetitive ways (a patient's heart monitor versus a music download, for example) disincentivizes the creation of faster, more reliable Internet service. Third, Con's claim that small businesses will be \"banned, therefore leaving them unable to get off the ground\" is false. Again, such exclusionary practices are covered by the antitrust laws. There is no need to create rigid net neutrality laws to cover a perceived risk which is already dealt with under antitrust in a more nuanced, flexible, fact-based way. 3. Con says \"if there were to be no net neutrality, high class providers such as Comcast and Verizon could sell special treatment to their favorite web companies like Google and Netflix, and charge extra fees to deliver their online videos and other content at fast speeds.\" Again, those \"fast speeds\" might not be developed in the absence of incentives to develop them. The ability to charge premium prices for faster speeds is what gives ISPs incentive to create faster, better, more reliable Internet services. The US Postal Service example is directly on point: no one has any problem with Express Mail (which costs more). Why should there by any problem with faster Internet lanes, for which companies can charge more. Always keep in mind that business practices which are legitimately anticompetitive -- practices that harm consumers or competition -- are already covered under the antitrust laws, so there's no need to create another layer of regulation, especially a rule so rigid and categorical as requiring net neutrality across-the-board, regardless of the circumstances and potential pro-competitive benefits. 4. Con says a net neutrality law is necessary to protect our privacy. But that's simply not true. What we need are stronger privacy laws, not a rigid net neutrality law. Con says that in the absence of net neutrality laws, ISPs have the \"power to decode any decryptions placed by their customers.\" But even if net neutrality laws exist, ISPs can still decode decryptions placed by their customers. Net neutrality proponents -- not Con since he didn't argue this point specifically -- argue that without net neutrality protections, ISPs will block privacy services. But like I've argued elsewhere, that sort of misconduct is covered by the antitrust laws. We don't need net neutrality laws to protect us from exclusionary, anticompetitive business practices. The only purpose of net neutrality laws is to avoid a perceived risk -- but that perceived risk is already covered by current laws. I direct attention again to FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell's comment that \"in the almost nine years since [net neutrality] fears were first sewn, net regulation lobbyists can point to fewer than a handful of cases of alleged misconduct, out of an infinite number of Internet communications. All those cases were resolved in favor of consumers under current law.\" [6] All net neutrality cases thus far have been resolved in favor of consumers under current law. We don't need more regulation to protect consumers, competition, or the Internet.", "qid": 46, "docid": "1ae9f84e-2019-04-18T15:25:04Z-00001-000", "score": 9.711400032043457}, {"content": "Title: The USFG should reject Net Neutrality. Content: (Note that I have neglected to mention a variety of arguments that have little or no bearing on the debate, 10000 characters are often not enough when debating a topic like this) IntroductionPro claims that he should be the winner of this debate because \u201cthe Opposition has not presented a case worthy of a win.\u201d But it was stated very explicitly in my 2nd Round that my strategy in this debate is not to provide positive arguments for net neutrality; instead I was to undermine Pro\u2019s arguments, by refuting all of his contentions, and thus show that there are exclusive benefits in rejecting net neutrality. If I do this successfully, then Pro has not met his BOP. But in doing so, I inadvertently affirm a case for net neutrality because in his 1st round, Pro has essentially set out the case for net neutrality, as he has already specified arguments in favour of net neutrality, such as:\u2022 A rejection of net neutrality enables \u201cbroadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content.\u201d\u2022 Net neutrality enables \u201cequal treatment\u201d and \u201cends [ending] discrimination in transmitting content\u201d, which is desirable. Pro then seeks out to refute them. But, if I successfully refute his criticisms, then these arguments for net neutrality are affirmed by default. So I personally do not have to provide positive arguments of my own, because Pro already has done so for me.In addition, in other areas of the debate, I have also implicitly made arguments for net neutrality such as:\u2022 \u201cISPs are not to be trusted with regulating and controlling the Internet.\u201dFreedom of Speech1. FCCa) Pro accepts that net neutrality as considered in this debate will be focussing on the principle or concept of net neutrality \u2013 in effect, all forms of net neutrality legislation. Pro takes issue with the \u201chighly transparent and democratic manner\u201d bit. He claims that the FCC already is highly transparent and democratic. This contradicts his later statement; that \u201cnet neutrality concentrates the decision of what is available into the hands of five commission members.\u201d [the FCC] I don\u2019t see how that is transparent and democratic (especially) at all. b) Pro also argues that my solution is \u201chypothetic\u201d and that I would need to present \u201cexamples of specific legislation spelling out how exactly transparency is achieved and grants solvency.\u201d I don\u2019t. No matter how hypothetical the scenario presented is, it still should be treated because we are dealing with net neutrality as a principle. c) Pro also argues that \u201cregardless of how transparent they are, their idea of \u2018fair\u2019 still does not line up with ours.\u201d But I am not advocating for the FCC to merely act \u201ctransparently\u201d, but also \u201chighly democratically\u201d. 2. Chinaa) Pro\u2019s argument is irrelevant. Even if we adopt the view that net neutrality would lead to infringements of freedom of speech with parallels to censorship in China, it still is a slippery slope.Consider the format of a slippery slope fallacy: \u201cIf we allow A to happen, then Z will eventually too, therefore A should not happen.\u201dWe can see that Pro\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t overcome the problem of a slippery slope, because Z is simply changed from \u201ccensorship that mirrors China\u201d to \u201ccensorship that has many parallels to censorship as seen in China.\u201d b) Pro misuses MacKinnon\u2019s article. Never in the article did MacKinnon talk about net neutrality, as a Control+F search of \u201cneutrality.\u201d would reveal. Instead, MacKinnon was talking about the Stop Online Piracy Act, a separate issue. Pro attempts to treat the issue lightly, making an argument based on history to suggest that \u201cit is not unreasonable to suggest that this is a possibility we should at the very least be wary of.\u201dc) Pro has not responded to my argument in the previous round that FCC actions regarding televisions and radios should not be compared with the Internet, because of the different ways information is transmitted between those. d) It is merely established that FCC\u2019s supposed infringement upon freedom of speech is a \u201cpossibility\u201d. But that alone is not enough to provide a reason why we should reject net neutrality. We could still have a rationale for implementing net neutrality, but merely be wary over the FCC ie. make their actions \u201chighly transparent and democratic\u201d. ISPs1. Blocking ContentPro claims that it is entirely reasonable that ISPs are able to block out legitimate content because they are the providers of a service, and thus it is entirely reasonable that they should be able to do what they want with such a service. Note that Pro has conceded the BitTorrent point, and shifts his attention to the rights of ISPs as a whole. a) This argument is that it entails a closed Internet, because ISPs \u201cfavour certain uses\u201d and \u201cexplicitly filter out content\u201d, even though it is presumed within the framework of this debate that a closed internet is not desirable. Thus, we should not grant them this right. b) Pro does attempt to address this argument, though. He argues that \u201cwith numerous ISPs and the free market allowing for other options for consumers, the internet remains open.\u201d This is true, when considering the internet from a wide scope. It should be noted that my argument looks at the openness of the Internet from the perspective of a subscriber of an ISP company choosing to filter out content. Thus, it is claimed that on balance, the Internet still remains more open if net neutrality were rejected, than if it were not, because the introduction of \u201cthe FCC as a presider over the internet\u201d is \u201ca clear introduction to a closed internet\u201d. d) Pro assumes that the FCC will abuse their power and promote actions that lead to a closed Internet. This is essentially his \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d argument repackaged. It should be discounted due to the fact that compelling replies have already been given to such an argument, as seen above. e) His argument \u2013 that net neutrality places the decision of what is available on the Internet into the hands of five commission members \u2013 fails due to the same issue. We are dealing with net neutrality as a principle rather than specific forms of its legislation. Pro\u2019s argument does not address net neutrality as a principle \u2013 net neutrality does not require 5 commission members to be in control \u2013 rather, it addresses specific forms of net neutrality.2. Innovationa) Pro has not addressed the descriptive-normative gap argument satisfactorily. Critics of his position do not deny that there are differences between the bandwidth needs of various content. The problem is how to link the descriptive statement (what is) to a normative statement (what ought). b) Merely restating the descriptive statement does not get anyone anywhere in bridging this gap. In order to get from an is to an ought, Pro must \u201ccombine the [is] with an ethical principle or assumption.\u201d (1) c) Pro\u2019s analogy of a store fails. Pro notes that different types of date have a different cost to be supplied. But this doesn\u2019t mean that different pricing schemes for different types of data should be adopted, because this is not necessarily in virtue of the type of data transmitted, but rather the ISPs\u2019 method of data transmission. Tom MacKay explains:\u201cISPs\u2026need to deal with connections between content providers and their own networks. When Game of Thrones freezes up, the problem could be saturation at the select locations where data leaves HBO and intersects with an ISP\u2026the ISP must upgrade their network to accommodate traffic that might be generated by a few high-data companies.\u201d (2)3. Europe a) The net neutrality regulations in Europe are recent \u2013 only established this year - so we can\u2019t make any judgements empirically.b) Pro needs to show that the reason that because Internet is lacking in Europe is a consequence of the establishment of broadband as a public utility. He, and the article he refers to, only cites a correlation between the two, not a causal relationship. There are other factors that should be taken into account eg. regarding broadband coverage, the discrepancy could be explained by the fact that the U.S is much richer than many European countries such as Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria.c) Cheng et.al in their paper The Debate on Net Neutrality: A Policy Perspective show that the opposite is the case. They use a \u201cgame theoretic model\u201d to evaluate the impact of net neutrality, and conclude that \u201cthe incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under net neutrality are higher than those under the no net neutrality regime except in some specific cases. Under net neutrality, the broadband service provider always invests in broadband infrastructure at the socially optimal level, but either under- or over-invests in infrastructure capacity in the absence of net neutrality.\u201d (3) Householda) I don\u2019t see how I have been selective with Pro\u2019s arguments, and Pro doesn\u2019t specify how so. Pro doesn\u2019t specify which source provides justifications for his claims, so I can\u2019t possibly evaluate his argument, considering that several of the sources are extremely long and for the most part, seemingly irrelevant. His quotation from \u201cthe Comcast article\u201d fails to justify both claims that I called out upon. b) I have addressed Pro\u2019s argument. I argued that rejection of net neutrality doesn\u2019t result in an immediate solution of network congestion, as with the case with an affirmation of net neutrality, so neither offers an advantage. ConclusionBy refuting Pro\u2019s arguments, I am in effect, making a case for net neutrality. Pro\u2019s major arguments have been refuted. Thus, I have implicitly made a case for net neutrality, as well as refuted Pro\u2019s arguments against it. The resolution is negated.

Content: I shall do this by refuting all his contentions, and in doing so, show that there are no exclusive benefits in rejecting net neutrality. Pro essentially argues that the USFG should reject net neutrality because \u201cnet neutrality does not, [in fact], result in a more open internet, but actually takes steps towards a closed internet. \u201d Note that in order for him to use this kind of reasoning and reach the position that the USFG should reject net neutrality, he needs to make the assumption that an open internet is more desirable than a closed internet, which he has not done. Personally, I do believe that an open internet is more desirable than a closed internet, so I\u2019m on his side on this, but I reject all contentions that he makes in attempting to show that net neutrality takes steps towards a closed internet. Let\u2019s see his contentions. Freedom of Speech Pro argues that enforcement of net neutrality would stifle freedom of speech. According to him, \u201canyone claiming that new network neutrality regulations through the FCC will result in \u2018greater freedom of speech\u2019 is frankly either lying, or deluded. \u201d Given that he has made a very strong claim, one would expect him to give solid reasons, or evidence, in support of his claim. Unfortunately, he has not done so. Essentially, his argument amounts to that the FCC doesn\u2019t support freedom of speech - as a matter of fact, it is against freedom of speech - and consequently, enforcement of net neutrality laws would, by giving the government more control of the Internet, thus stifling freedom of speech. Such an argument is problematic in several ways:(a) Regarding his claim that the FCC is not supportive, and never will be supportive of freedom of speech, he gives no reasoning or evidence whatsoever. Essentially, his argument amounts to a bare-assertion fallacy. (b) Enforcement of net neutrality laws do not give the government more power to control what is available to us on the Internet. This is because the FCC does not seek to regulate the Internet, instead, it is regulating the way that telecommunication industries operate their Internet services. Perhaps in anticipation of (b), Pro creates a slippery slope argument. He observes that the Chinese government strongly regulates telecommunication industries in China, thus promoting censorship and the rejection of freedom of speech. Thus, Pro argues, net neutrality regulation may be the first step further governmental control and restriction over the Internet. There are multiple things wrong with this argument:(a) Slippery slope arguments \u201c[avoid] engaging with the issue and instead shifts attention to extreme hypotheticals. \u201d Thus, they are fallacious (1)(b)There is a big difference between the way regulation of telecommunication industries as advocated by the supporter of net neutrality in the US and the way telecommunication industries are regulated in China. In China, actual website content is blocked, while enforcement of net neutrality laws only lead to the regulation of how the telecommunication industry can transfer information on the Internet. Thus, Pro needs to give reasons to how net neutrality regulation would lead to the type of censorship observed in China. (c) China and the U. S cannot be compared, because of the different socio-political situations between the two countries. For one, the Chinese government has a strong incentive/motive in committing acts of internet censorship and restricting freedom of speech - eg. to silence dissent and preserve the political system present in China by restricting knowledge of other political systems - while the U. S government does not. Second, the U. S is far more democratic than China - it\u2019s citizens have a greater influence on governmental policy, for an example of Internet policy, look at SOPA. Thus, we should be skeptical over his claims that net neutrality would eventually lead to a closed internet in this sense. Net Neutrality and Competition Pro argues that Comcast\u2019s blocking of torrent sites housing pirated content was justified, and that \u201carguing this [Comcast\u2019s actions] as a supporting factor of net neutrality is ludicrous. \u201d(a) Adherents of net neutrality do not use Comcast\u2019s actions as a reason for promoting net neutrality. Rather, they use this as an example to illustrate the fact that ISPs are not to be trusted with regulating and controlling the Internet, thus acting as a reason against Pro\u2019s position that the USFG should reject net neutrality, rather than a positive reason for net neutrality. (b) Pro cherry-picks information by only mentioning that Comcast was blocking torrent sites housing pirated content. Rather, Comcast was blocking BitTorrent traffic in general, as his source indicates. (2) It is important to note that BitTorrent is not solely used for pirating content - there plenty of legitimate uses such as legally downloading game updates, and the Internet Archive - because BitTorrent is merely a means to spread information. (3) Thus, blocking BitTorrent traffic would also infringe upon legal uses of the technology. (c) Pro has not shown that it is the \u201cprerogative\u201d of ISPs to block illegal and pirated content. Indeed, it could be argued that the sole purpose of ISPs is to provide Internet access, and thus they should not be controlling what their clients are doing on the Internet, because it is out of their bounds. Pro also provides several reasons why rejecting net-neutrality laws do not promote monopolies. For instance, he argues that net neutrality will not end monopolies, instead it makes it harder to end monopolies. (a) Advocates of net neutrality do not argue that net neutrality regulation will end monopolies; instead they are arguing that rejection of net neutrality will promote the development of monopolies/duopolies etc, or that net neutrality regulation will make it easier to end monopolies/duopolies etc. Thus, Pro\u2019s statement is non-topical. (b) Essentially all of this segment regarding competition is pure assertion. Pro has not justified any of the claims he makes here, and thus on this basis alone, all of his claims should be discounted until he provides justification. Innovation (a) Pro claims that Internet content such as \u201can online calculator, a funny home video, and an e-Book\u201d should not be treated equally, because they are not equal in importance. But the importance of such content is not intrinsic, but relative to different people. Thus, the question of whose perspective discerns the importance of online content is raised. (b) Pro argues that because the various content on the Internet are different, they ought to be treated differently. However, he makes the jump from a descriptive statement (various content on the Internet are different) to a normative statement (they ought to be treated differently) arbitrarily, and does not show how the descriptive statement logically leads to the normative statement. Pro uses an analogy of a household in order to illustrate why rejecting net neutrality would be beneficial, and extends this logic towards an entire community. Fundamentally, this is a question of how to deal with network congestion, and Pro argues that rejecting net neutrality would help solve this problem. However: (a) In the case that net neutrality is rejected, and ISPs are able to deal with network congestion through allowing in variation of pricing Internet access according to how one uses the Internet, Pro does not elaborate on which method ISPs are to do this. Do customers sign up to an Internet package which is optimised for what they are to do with the Internet (eg. a package optimised for watching Netflix)? Do customers sign up to a rather blank Internet package, and the pricing is determined later on how customers use their Internet? Both are in my view, problematic, and I would like Pro to elaborate on the specific details of his view. (b) The fact that the two people in the household are unable to complete simple activities on the Internet such as Google searches (this also applies when Pro\u2019s argument is extended to the community) does not mean that net neutrality should be rejected. S. Derek Turner notes that net neutrality regulation as pushed for still \u201cleave ISPs completely free to address congestion via reasonable network management methods. \u201d (4) Thus, the benefit of being able to address network congestion effectively as argued by proponents of net neutrality rejection is not exclusive to their position, and net neutrality still allows room to fix these problems. Pro claims that \u201csimilar regulations are place in Europe\u201d. However, what regulations are he talking about? Net neutrality regulations? His Source 4 states that there are no established net neutrality regulations in the European Union. So where in Europe is he talking about? Regardless of this, it is a factual mistake to claim that \u201cbroadband services are significantly cheaper in the US\u201d, when in reality, broadband service is actually much more expensive in the U. S when compared to many areas in Europe (3 times more expensive than in the U. K and France) (5) Conclusion In this round, I have refuted the core of Pro\u2019s arguments, showing that none of his 3 main contentions stand up to scrutiny, and as a result, show that there are no benefits (exclusive) in rejecting net neutrality. Thus, Pro has not affirmed his burden of proof, and the resolution is negated.

Content: Thanks, Pro, for your quick yet substantive rebuttals. Freedom of SpeechFirst, I would like to provide a general criticism of Pro\u2019s argument that the FCC would through net neutrality, infringe upon freedom of speech. Note that the resolution of the debate concerns whether \u201cthe USFG should reject net neutrality.\u201d But he has not specified exactly which form of net neutrality legislation the USFG ought the reject. Thus, we are left to concluding that he is arguing that the USFG ought to reject net neutrality as a general principle; a concept - in effect, all forms of net neutrality. Pro too notes that he was quite interested in \u201cthe concept of net neutrality\u201d. As a result, this debate should focus on net neutrality as a principle of a concept. However, his argument - the FCC would likely infringe upon freedom of speech through net neutrality \u2013 is not sufficient to reach the conclusion \u2013 the USFG ought to reject net neutrality as a general principle; in effect, all forms of net neutrality. This is because Pro\u2019s argument has a very narrow scope; it only deals with the FCC as the enforcer, rather than net neutrality itself. In effect, his argument does not take into consideration potential net neutrality legislation; for instance, ones that in order to be enforced, requires the FCC to regulate ISPs in a highly transparent and democratic manner. In this scenario, it may be that the FCC has a strong incentive in reinvoking the Fairness Doctrine, but this is ultimately irrelevant. Pro argues that because previously, the FCC has regulated content on TV and radio and was allowed to decide what was content-neutral, the FCC is likely to infringe upon freedom of speech on the Internet. But the problem is that the FCC was allowed to decide on their interpretation on what was content-neutral. As noted, the resolution is dealing with net neutrality as a principle. In legislation of net neutrality where the FCC was not allowed to define \u201ccontent neutral\u201d, this argument would no longer apply. In addition, Pro neglected to mention that structural differences between the operation of TV + Radio and the Internet. Leonhardt notes that:\u201cthe Internet \u201cdecouples\u201d the strong link between transmission and content; therefore, there is nothing on the Internet that is directly analogous to a television or radio broadcaster. Television broadcasters both transmit data and control its content, so that when a person watches NBC, they are only seeing NBC\u2019s programming. Conversely, on the Internet, the signal comes to a home from an Internet Service Provider (ISP), such as AT&T, Comcast, Road Runner, or Verizon.57 However, once a consumer has a signal, they can view any content at all\u2014even content created by a competing ISP.\u201d (1) Consequently, we also should by default reject Pro\u2019s slippery slope argument regarding the possibility of net neutrality leading to censorship as seen in China, because it falls to the same \u201cgeneral criticism\u201d I already made above. But even if we do not reject such an argument by default we could make a variety of criticisms. Firstly, I noted in the 2nd round that Pro\u2019s argument is logically fallacious because it commits the slippery slope fallacy. Pro never responded to this, although he did indicate that he would eventually respond to all arguments, so I\u2019ll wait for him to do so. I also argued that because of the socio-political differences between in America and China, it is unlikely that net neutrality would lead to censorship like seen in China. Pro does not dispute this point; he merely argues that government officials still have the intention of keeping in power. However, this is irrelevant, because I am arguing that regardless of the government\u2019s will to stay in power, infringement upon freedom of speech would probably never happen due to the differences between the two countries. CompetitionPreviously, I argued that because there are legitimate uses of BitTorrent, Comcast should not have blocked BitTorrent traffic. Pro\u2019s reply misses the mark. Firstly, he argues that the \u201csite should solely be halted because it traffics pirated content, regardless of legal activities\u201d. However, Comcast was not solely blocking sites that hold pirated content available through BitTorrent, they were blocking BitTorrent traffic in general. In addition, there many examples of sites that use BitTorrent for solely legal purposes and have no pirated content. I provided the example of the Internet Archive in my previous round. To elaborate upon my last round, I also suggested that in order to download and update specific games, one would use a client that is dependent on BitTorrent technology. Furthermore, Pro shifts burden-of-proof. His argument is dependent on the assumption (aka. Hidden premise) that ISPs have the right to block out specific content ie. BitTorrent traffic, thus he is expected to defend the premise, just like any other premise. I don\u2019t have to provide an argument against this assumption, I merely have to ensure that his hidden premise is not affirmed, and I can do this by providing arguments of my own, criticising his arguments for the hidden premise, or both. In the 2nd Round, Pro also notes that he is arguing that net neutrality would take steps towards a closed Internet, rather than an open Internet, and thus it should be rejected. I showed that in order for this to lead logically to the USFG rejecting net neutrality, Pro would have to assume that an open Internet is desirable, and that a closed Internet is undesirable. I noted that I too support an open internet. Thus, this debate is run on the parameters that an open Internet is desirable, whilst a closed Internet is undesirable. Recall that the definition of closed Internet that is applied to this debate is: \u201cwhere established corporations or governments favor certain uses; may have restricted access to necessary web standards, artificially degrade some services, or explicitly filter out content.\u201dIf Pro is willing to defend Comcast\u2019s blocking of BitTorrent traffic/websites - which is a textbook example of \u201cexplicitly filter[ing] content\u201d - he is in effect defending actions leading to a closed Internet. However, this makes his case inconsistent, because he is arguing that net neutrality leads to a closed Internet, and thus should be rejected while at the same time supporting other actions which lead to a closed Internet. Innovationa) Pro misread me; I was not affirming that the value of the examples to be intrinsic, I was saying that those were relative. For instance, I would place the highest value on the e-Book, then the online calculator, and next-to-no value on the funny home video. In contrast, somebody may else may have the exact opposite. If ISPs were to regulate content as Pro proposes, then the problem of how the ISP should discern the value of each of these examples is raised. b) I argued that Pro needs to show how the descriptive statement logically leads to the normative statement. This is because descriptive statements only deal with how the world works, in effect, what is. However, a normative statement deals with how the world ought to be, in other worlds, what should be the case, and thus lack logical connection. (2) Pro has not shown how they logically do connect; he is merely restating the descriptive statement. To show how the descriptive statement leads to the normative statement, at the very least, Pro must assume that different entities ought to be treated differently because of their differences. Householda) The winner of this debate is determined on the basis of what would be \u201cnet beneficial\u201d. Thus, I am essentially arguing that in the case of ISPs having to price content at different prices in the case of net neutrality being rejected, negative consequences will follow. So my question is relevant towards the debate, and thus must be answered. b) It was conceded last round that rejection of net neutrality nevertheless allows for solving the problem of network congestion. This is an important concession on behalf of Pro. Nevertheless, he makes the argument that \u201cISPs have not addressed internet congestion because they feel a better solution is to have clients paying for the level of data they want to use\u201d and \u201cdue to the enormous cost of doing so\u201d. But Pro has not justified neither claims, so at this point, we can only conclude that both are conjectures. Pro also argues that \u201ca rejection of net neutrality would result in an immediate solution; the institution of net neutrality legislation allows for solution, but depends on actions by ISPs independent of legislation\u201d, and thus we should favour the rejection of net neutrality. But a rejection of net neutrality does not result in an immediate solution. ISPs would still have to deal with a variety of questions such as how they ought to discern the importance of different content; which ones to put in the \u201cfast lane\u201d and how what form of pricing they should offer customers. In addition, a rejection of net neutrality legislation only entails that data should not be treated equally, it doesn\u2019t immediately lead to the ISP enforcing the particular pricing scheme that Pro advocates; they merely have the freedom to do so. Thus, a rejection of net neutrality offers no particular advantage to an affirmation of net neutrality in managing web congestion. ConclusionPro still needs to address several criticisms that I had made in the previous round. Many of the criticisms that he has supposedly addressed \u2013 as seen in this round \u2013 still ultimately triumph. Furthermore, a number of original objections were raised in this round, also rendering Pro\u2019s counterarguments to be unviable. Thus, Pro still has not fulfilled his burden of proof. The resolution is negated.

Content: But with that said, let\u2019s get down to business. In this Final Round, I will provide a final criticism of Pro\u2019s arguments, helping to tie up some loose ends along the way, and also clarify a variety of points that I have made. In addition, I will also use this round to attempt to convince readers that they should vote for Con, rather than Pro. The FCCPro focusses a significant amount of his final round to focus on the FCC, and makes a variety of criticisms, many surrounding on the on the concepts of \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cconcept. \u201d Thus, it is important to clarify what exactly is a principle, or a concept. The Oxford English Dictionary (Kindle Edition) defines principle as:\u201cA general idea of plan, although the details are not yet established. \u201dAlso by the OED, concept is defined as: \u201cAn abstract idea\u201dHowever, Pro argues that we should focus on current net neutrality proposals because \u201cdebating any other form of legislation is not of immediate relevance, as it is not being considered for institution. \u201d But, given the definitions of \u201cprinciple\u201d and \u201cconcept\u201d this is clearly absurd. As per the definition of principle, we are considering net neutrality in general, and considering it as if \u201cthe details are not established. \u201d As per the definition of concept, we are to focus on net neutrality as \u201can abstract idea\u201d. Therefore, Pro\u2019s rebuttal bears little relevance; by attempting to focus this debate on current net neutrality legislation, regardless of its immediate relevance, he is destroying the whole purpose of debating a principle, or concept. Previously, I gave an example of a scenario where Pro\u2019s arguments that the FCC has no interest in representing freedom of speech are nullified \u2013 where the FCC regulates ISPs in a highly transparent and democratic manner. Pro critiques this by questioning the possibility of the FCC acting in a \u201chighly transparent and democratic manner\u201d and argues that this is an \u201cunachieved goal for decades\u201d and that the whole point of government is \u201cbuilt around the concept of being transparent and democratic. \u201d This rebuttal misses the point of my hypothetical scenario. The feasibility of this scenario bears little relevance because the whole point of this hypothetical scenario is to be far-fetched, because in doing so, it shows that Pro\u2019s freedom of speech argument does not apply in all scenarios, and thus, we can\u2019t reject net neutrality as a principle, or concept \u2013 merely recent forms of its legislation. One final argument relevant to the FCC that Pro makes against my argument that TVs and radios can\u2019t be compared with the Internet, because of the way information is transferred in each medium. Pro responds by citing Section 706 and Title II. But this completely misses the point of my argument. My argument was not to do with how the FCC oversees the various mediums, but how they act in regulating information. In addition, Pro has not elaborated at all on how net neutrality fails to take into consideration differences between such mediums, and how I have undermined my own case. ChinaBy the end of the debate, Pro concedes that he was only making a comparison. In contrast, at the beginning of the debate, he was adamant about the possibility of the US\u2019s internet being similar to China\u2019s, even invoking Negri\u2019s statement that \u201cAmericans may unwittingly be on the road to ceding power to forces that can use the Internet against them, as is seen in China every day. \u201d Pro is correct in saying that we should note similarities between the two, and the outcomes of various policies in other countries. But it we only do this, then that leaves Pro with no real argument to enforce, and he does not sufficiently clarify his position on this issue, especially considering his change of view since Round 2. If he is still arguing that net neutrality would lead to Internet with similarities to that seen in China, then it still is a slippery slope. If he is arguing that we merely should be cautious, and take this into consideration, then there is no rationale for rejecting net neutrality; we could still accept it, but just be cautious. ISPsIt is important to note that a essentially of this section (as left by Pro in his final round) is based on the assumption that the FCC is against freedom of speech, and would set limits on what one would do on the Internet. This is an assumption that has been debated throughout this debate, but falls short of establishing that a net benefit would be reached without net neutrality. This is because \u2013 as I have argued for many times in this debate - it takes a narrow scope, rather than a broad scope regarding net neutrality \u2013 it is focussing on specific forms of net neutrality legislation, rather than net neutrality as a principle, or a concept. Once again, Pro has failed to show how the descriptive statement to the normative statement. He merely complains that my attempts to \u201cphilosophically analyse this practice is simply an attempt to distract from the real issue. \u201d However, firstly, as Pro himself notes, I have conceded that there are differences between the bandwidth needs of various content. However, it is completely false to say that I am \u201clooking for a debate on economics\u201d as Pro claims. It is also untrue that the real issue is \u201cthat content is priced differently as a result of product cost differential\u201d. As a matter of fact, I argue that the real issue is to do with moral philosophy. This is because Pro is arguing that ISPs ought to be charging differently based on the type of content. Naturally, this leads into the realm of moral philosophy, because such a realm deals with what is right and what is wrong, what ought to be done, what ought not to be done; the normative aspects. Of course, positive economics is relevant to some extent. However, in this case, it is concerning the descriptive aspect of content, but not what ought to happen; the normative aspect. Pro hasn\u2019t really addressed this problem; instead, he keeps trying to push us back to a debate on the descriptive statement. Pro appeals to the fact that prices should be varying because to make a profit because \u201cit is common business practice\u201d. However, this doesn\u2019t lead logically to the conclusion that the prices should be varying. Simply because something is common business practice does not mean that this is right, or should be allowed in policy. Consequently, we have seen no compelling reason that ISPs should be pricing content differently, as per their bandwidth needs. We have merely seen that different content have different bandwidth needs. InnovationOne thing to note is that Pro has completely dropped his argument that there is empirical evidence showing that regulation of telecommunications companies in Europe leads to less innovation, and has negative effects, such as limiting consumer access to the Internet. Previously, I argued that this conclusion cannot be reached on the basis of the evidence he has provided, because it does not show a causal relationship between the two. Furthermore, I provided a study by Chang et. al which shows that net neutrality has the opposite effect on innovation as Pro claims; it is actually beneficial in regard to innovation (especially infrastructure), rather than detrimental. Pro has not attempted to refute this evidence. Thus, it can be concluded that there are no good reasons to believe that innovation will be negatively affected by net neutrality, only positively affected. HouseholdPro appears to concede that an ISP\u2019s pricing plan as advocated by him is also dependant on the ISP\u2019s actions. However, he still argues that network congestion is more likely to be solved without net neutrality than with net neutrality. His argument relies on the premise that \u201cwith net neutrality, ISPs are not required to upgrade their systems. \u201d Firstly, this is completely unjustified. It is also clearly false. In the previous round, I brought up McKay\u2019s observation that network congestion is also due to the ISP\u2019s method of data transmission between different servers. We can extend this to show that with net neutrality, ISPs have an incentive to upgrade this servers. This stems from the fact that because ISPs are not able to introduce their pricing schemes, they must find different ways to deal with net congestion, such as upgrading their systems. Conversely, if net neutrality was not introduced, and ISPs were to introduce a pricing scheme as advocated by Pro, they would have no incentive in upgrading their systems, because the problem is already solved. Thus, Pro\u2019s logic falls back on him. ConclusionThis debate took an interesting direction (largely because I misread Pro\u2019s Round 1 and thought that he had the sole BOP for a while), but nevertheless, as we are at the end of the debate, I contend that there are good reasons why the audience should vote Con. (1) Pro has not fulfilled his burden of proof, because all of his arguments fail in one way or another. There are no successful arguments against net neutrality offered by Pro. (2) I have shown that by refuting Pro\u2019s arguments against net neutrality, I am implicitly making a case for net neutrality, due to the way Pro presents his case. This remained undisputed by Pro by the end of the debate. (3) Pro has dropped many of his core arguments. For instance, his argument about Europe\u2019s internet, and his argument that a rejection of net neutrality fuels competition (note that he never addressed this, after I called out his bare assertion in Round 2. ) (4) I have made positive arguments that have been unrefuted and untouched by Pro. For instance, net neutrality is beneficial towards innovation (from Cheng et. al) and that net neutrality helps dissipate monopolies and duopolies (Round 2).

Content: -My great thanks to an excellent opponent for providing excellent opposition in this debate; I legitimately enjoyed it! -In this final round, I will seek to address all of the main points and summarize arguments to as to be as clear as possible on the rational for why I have succeeded in fulfilling the resolution that the USFG should reject Network Neutrality. Freedom of Speech -I agreed that we are considering the concept of net neutrality as \u201ca general principle/concept; we are considering all forms of network neutrality legislation.\u201d Inherent to this, while certainly debating the merits of the possible, we are focusing on the current net neutrality legislation as proposed by the USFG; debating any other form of legislation is not of immediate relevance, as it is not being considered for institution. Thus, my previous arguments against net neutrality via the FCC stand, as ALL current forms of proposed net neutrality legislation specifically utilize the FCC as the primary actor, an argument which Opposition ceded and attempts to circumvent by arguing that we are only addressing net neutrality as a concept in an effort to eliminate all historical applications of net neutrality legislation, including through the FCC, thus hoping to eliminate all arguments against freedom of speech; this clearly fails. -Opposition protests that my arguments are very narrow in that \u201cit only deals with the FCC as the enforcer,\u201d an argument addressed above; however, note that Opposition\u2019s only suggested alternative to current net neutrality legislation is one which \u201crequires the FCC to regulate ISPs in a highly transparent and democratic manner,\u201d with the suggestion that this would prevent such control of the internet by the FCC suggested previously. The first problem is that this still involves the FCC as the enforcer, negating Oppositions solution. -Opposition further misunderstands my arguments regarding the \u201chighly transparent and democratic manner\u201d bit. I never argue that the FCC is highly transparent and democratic, but rather that they are tasked with being highly transparent and democratic. Opposition\u2019s solution for corruption and the FCC\u2019s blatant censorship is to make them \u201chighly transparent and democratic,\u201d yet doesn\u2019t have any suggestions on how. The problem with this approach is that they are already thus tasked; in fact, our entire form of government is built around the concept of being transparent and democratic, yet clearly there have been failings therein. Tacking a \u201chighly democratic\u201d onto a \u2018highly transparent\u2019 does not change the course of the government. The reason that I reject such a hypothetical as Opposition\u2019s arguments have become invested in is because it has been an unachieved goal for decades. It is one thing to suggest a hypothetical on merit of its benefits; it is another entirely to argue solvency from a hypothetical without solvency for the hypothetical, the difference being: Opposition has suggested how we would benefit from a highly transparent and democratic FCC/government, yet fails to suggest the method of obtaining said transparency. Further, Opposition\u2019s solvency is entirely speculation; Opposition has presented absolutely no proof that this theoretical transparency could result in the circumvention of the threats of concentrating power over ISPs into government hands, and therefore this argument is non-topical. China -It is neither inappropriate nor fallacial to note similarities between proposed US legislation and acts of censorship in foreign nations, nor is it fallacial to note the outcomes of such in foreign nations. I never argued that the outcome of net neutrality legislation will be China; I simply note the similarities and suggest that comparatively speaking, such actions of giving government control over the internet has led to government abusing this power-I am arguing for the similarity between the two. If such a comparison is fallacial, then every time we look to another nation, corporation, form of legislation, etc. to try and gauge the reaction/outcome of our pending actions based off of the outcome of theirs so as to improve upon it, we commit a fallacy, meaning one of two things: either our everyday actions are fallacial, yet work and have proven beneficial in reforming the path of our nation to avoid the mistakes of others; or Opposition\u2019s interpretation here is mistaken. Either way this is a legitimate comparison that is used every day in our government to improve our policies and avoid the mistakes of others. For this reason the argument stands. c) Opposition notes that \u201cPro has not responded to my argument in the previous round that FCC actions regarding televisions and radios should not be compared with the Internet, because of the different ways information is transmitted between those.\u201d Opposition appears to be forgetting that under current legislation via Section 706 and Title II, internet services would be regrouped from information services to the same regulations governing common carriers (radio, TV). Thus, as the FCC will have the exact same level of control and oversight of the internet as it did over radio and TV, these two are absolutely comparable despite all informational transmission differences because the law would treat them absolutely the same. I am not ignoring the structural differences between TV/radio and the internet; rather, net neutrality legislation is. Your argument serves to undermine your own case. ISPs 1. Blocking Content a + b) On the contrary; I recognize the perspective you are coming from. I simply argue that on balance, the allowance of the market to introduce new ISPs without the restrictions of ones such as Comcast (the sole example of content exclusions cited in this debate) will allow for a net benefit. The FCC (or any other governmental entity) would impose strict regulations of what is/is not acceptable on the internet, and this content would simply be gone; nobody has access. Under ISPs, there could be limited content disallowed, but on the whole no content is strictly forbidden, and the market allows for the emergence of new ISPs supplying the content blocked by others; it is in their best interest economically in such a market (without net neutrality regulations) to supply as much content as possible. d) I disagree; I feel compelling responses have been given as to why we should consider solely the FCC as actor under net neutrality legislation. e) My argument here succeeds for the same reason cited above. Further, my arguments move past the specific legislation being considered in the US to other forms of net neutrality; I have asserted on several occasions that the fact that one commission (the FCC) has existed and been able to garner so much control over methods of communication shows the capacity for such organizations to exist. The mere fact that net neutrality legislation would entail giving a governmental body authority over the internet is sufficient argument against the institution of net neutrality legislation. 2. Innovation a + b) Opposition appears to be looking for a debate on economics; the recognition that \u201cthere are differences between the bandwidth needs of various content\u201d directly leads to the conclusion, by businesses in general, that the pricing should vary accordingly to make a profit. This is common business practice, and Opposition\u2019s attempt to philosophically analyze this practice is simply an attempt to distract from the real issue, which is that content is priced differently as a result of the production cost differential (which Opposition concedes to be true). c) This doesn\u2019t change the fact that it can cost more to transmit certain types of data, thus costing more, regardless of where precisely the cost originates. Household b) The probability of network congestion being resolved is stronger without net neutrality. With net neutrality, ISPs are not required to upgrade their systems, resulting in no solution from net neutrality legislation. With ISPs being able to price their own internet packages, congestion is reduced due to users paying for their usage, but there is also a greater level of income with which to reform the system. The odds of network congestion solvency due to incentive by ISPs is much greater without net neutrality, granting Government net benefits in this instance. Conclusion -Opposition\u2019s case relies heavily on very technical arguments, the foremost being that we should only analyze net neutrality as a concept, excluding the aspect of existing legislature. However, it is crucial for this debate to analyze not only net neutrality as a concept, but to also include the existing set of reforms which would enact net neutrality in the US. Hypothetical forms of legislation only become relevant once proposed, because here were are trying to argue the merits of that net neutrality legislation with which we have the potential to be governed by in the future. The only reason for Opposition\u2019s exclusion of current legislation is the FCC\u2019s history and the weight this lends to the Government in this debate. -Further, Opposition\u2019s only proposed argument against the right of ISP\u2019s to price their services freely is that \u201cthey can\u2019t be trusted to govern the internet\u201d and \u201cit would hurt the consumer.\u201d As I have argued, an increased cost to the consumer has no bearing on the right of ISPs to self-determine pricing. Additionally, in arguing that ISPs cannot be trusted with the internet, Opposition is essentially arguing that the government (via the FCC) can. I have continually shown this assertion to be false throughout this debate; Opposition\u2019s attempts to exclude the FCC from this debate following Round 2 only serves to support this point. I feel I have very thoroughly shown that the Government has earned net benefits in support of the resolution, The USFG Should Reject Network Neutrality, and that the Opposition has not upheld its burden of proof in this resolution. -The Resolution is Upheld.", "qid": 46, "docid": "f5b3410d-2019-04-18T15:41:50Z-00001-000", "score": 9.348799705505371}, {"content": "Title: Net neutrality Content: To conclude, I'll do a short rebuttal, and then I'll do a recap of the whole debate. == Rebuttal == (1) Pro says that net neutrality was a \"founding principle\" of the Internet. First, Pro's simply wrong: \"net neutrality\" is a recent phrase, coined by Tim Wu in 2003. [1] Second, Pro offers no source for his claim, so it's unreliable (and again, wrong). Third, even if Pro's right that net neutrality is a \"founding principle,\" that's irrelevant to this debate. The issue we're debating is whether to require net neutrality, or whether to allow entrepreneurs to experiment (e.g. Lariat Wireless, discussed in Round 2 and dropped by Pro). (2) Pro says antitrust laws \"don't work because regulation of ISPs are horrible.\" But that makes no sense. Regulations aren't relevant to how the antitrust laws work. Antitrust laws apply in the absence of regulations. Antitrust laws prevent Amazon from blocking other online sites because the antitrust laws explicitly prohibit the \"attempt to monopolize\" and the \"abuse of monopoly power.\" There's no other way to characterize \"paying to block your competitors\" than an \"abuse of monopoly power\" or an \"attempt to monopolize.\" Both are illegal under our antitrust laws. (3) Pro continues to assert that the \"FCC guy\" was \"funded by version,\" but he provides no source for that claim. There's no reason to think FCC commissioners are funded by ISPs. (4) Pro says the FCC passed net neutrality rules. Yes, that's true. But that's also completely irrelevant to the debate, which is about whether there should be net neutrality laws, not whether there exist any net neutrality laws. And if the debate's about whether there exists net neutrality laws, then Pro still loses because the FCC rules haven't gone into effect yet, they're being challenged in the courts (and the last couple net neutrality rules the FCC approved were struck down by courts), and a change in administration could reverse the FCC's rule. (5) I agree with Pro that government should regulate some things, including some aspects of telecommunications. But there's no need to regulate net neutrality. == Recap == The argument against net neutrality is simple: net neutrality doesn't distinguish procompetitive discrimination from anticompetitive discrimination. Pro never challenged that argument. Instead, he claims that net neutrality laws are necessary to prevent anticompetitive discrimination. But as I explained throughout the debate, that's simply untrue. Our antitrust laws -- which have developed over the past 100 years -- are enough to protect consumers and competition from anticompetitive discrimination. The antitrust laws also allow entrepreneurs like Lariat Wireless (see Round 2) to experiment with procompetitive forms of data discrimination. The idea is to cater to the consumer, and in doing so, lower prices. The net result is that more people can get online than if we had a rigid net neutrality law, because prices are lower. It also leads to creative business models, which spurts growth and innovation. Pro never contests the substance of my argument. His only points throughout the debate focus on showing that ISPs can harm consumers and competition in the absence of net neutrality. But Pro offered no sourcing for any of his claims, even though I asked multiple times. The reason is because most of his claims aren't true. Moreover, I showed throughout the debate that Pro's wrong, because the antitrust laws already -- and the keyword there is \"already\" -- stop ISPs from harming consumers and competition. Pro never argues otherwise. Thus, there's simply no reason to displace our antitrust laws, which are flexible and fact-based, with a rigid net neutrality law that doesn't distinguish the procompetitive from the anticompetitive.", "qid": 46, "docid": "2b6ac2c3-2019-04-18T15:10:44Z-00000-000", "score": 9.337900161743164}, {"content": "Title: The USFG should reject Net Neutrality. Content: Many thanks to my opponent for a great debate and prompt replies!-To confirm Opposition\u2019s note that we are either accepting or rejecting net neutrality as a general principle/concept, this is correct-we are considering all forms of network neutrality legislation.-That said, Opposition argues that the logical connective cannot be made between the FCC infringing upon freedom of speech and the USFG rejecting net neutrality legislation because my arguments only address the FCC as the agency of said legislation. There are several flaws with Opposition\u2019s argumentation here. First, Opposition overlooks the fact that ALL current network neutrality legislation would employ the FCC as the enforcer. Opposition\u2019s sole example of legislation which does not require the FCC as enforcer is \u201cfor instance, ones that in order to be enforced, requires the FCC to regulate ISPs in a highly transparent and democratic manner.\u201d This, again, uses the FCC as enforcer; unless Opposition can produce an example to the contrary, this argument is irrelevant. My primary issue with this statement is that Opposition suggests that the FCC is not currently tasked with operating in a \u201chighly transparent and democratic manner.\u201d They absolutely are! Yet we constantly see with government a gap between what they are obligated to do, and what they do in reality. Unless Opposition presents examples of specific legislation spelling out exactly how such transparency is achieved and grants solvency, this is simply a hypothetical solution. Further, Opposition\u2019s argument that a strong incentive to reinstate the fairness doctrine would be irrelevant in a \u2018highly transparent\u2019 organization is also making broad assumptions about the commission. Regardless of how transparent they are, their idea of \u2018fair\u2019 still does not line up with ours, and their ideology will continue to influence their decisions regardless of whether we achieve the \u2018transparency\u2019 Opposition argues for.-I believe Opposition\u2019s objections to the use of China as an example are unfounded for several reasons. First, Opposition argues that this is a slippery slope, that the US could never mirror China for internet censorship. Note that this was not the intent of my point; the use of China as an example is to show the similarities between censorship in China and what would be achieved by net neutrality in the US. Journalist Rebecca MacKinnon states \u201cThe intention is not the same as China\u2019s Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar\u201d in reference to SOPA and net neutrality [1]. Judging by the historical implications of the FCC I introduced in my last round, it is not unreasonable to suggest this as a possibility we should at the very least be wary of; as such, I reject Opposition\u2019s argument of \u2018slippery slope,\u2019 for the reason that there is a very clear. Opposition then states \u201cinfringement upon freedom of speech would probably never happen due to the differences between the two countries.\u201d It is this type of unguarded stance that allows our rights to become infringed upon. Regardless of socio-political differences between America and China, the characteristics inherent to human nature which cause the desire to influence the opinions of others in favor of self are clearly existent in both nations. Then of course there\u2019s the fact that the FCC has already infringed upon our freedom of speech, something Opposition has yet to attempt to contradict.-A crux issue in this debate is the question of whether or not ISPs have the right to block out specific content, ie. decide what they make available to clients. I have already made it clear that I support this right for ISPs. Opposition has argued that this result in legitimate content being blocked from users; so what? ISPs as providers of a service should be able to decide exactly what their service entails. This does not mean I support spontaneous blocking of sites; I do agree that ISPs should be open with consumers about what they have access to-I simply believe they are within their rights to block sites if they wish. Secondly, even should each point in support of ISPs having this right be rejected, Opposition is still required to suggest reasons they should not have this right in order to receive a vote under net benefits, a burden Opposition has not upheld. I strongly urge Opposition to present reasons why this is outside the right of ISPs, as the only argument presented thus far is that it isn\u2019t best for the consumer-this is why consumers change ISPs. This is where the free market comes in; if one company doesn\u2019t satisfy the consumer, the market provides a new option to make a profit through satisfying this new market of consumers. -I apologize for omitting this from my first response, but I concede Opposition\u2019s point that I never explicitly stated that an open internet is more desirable than a closed internet. To clarify, my stance is that an open internet is more desirable, and further hold to my contention that net neutrality legislation will result in a net decrease in the openness of the internet. Opposition argues that allowing ISPs to restrict content access would result in a closed internet; I assert that this regardless is a net increase in the internet\u2019s openness. First, with numerous ISPs and the free market allowing for other options to emerge for consumers, the internet remains open, in contrast to net neutrality which introduces the FCC as presider over the internet, a clear introduction to a closed internet. Thus, net neutrality will result in a net reduction of internet openness, regardless of slight restriction by ISPs. We are, essentially, choosing the greater evil, which is government censorship/control of the internet. -I would also like to point out that net neutrality concentrates the decision of what is available into the hands of five commission members, as opposed to numerous ISPs and their corporation structures. I personally would choose option B any day. At a certain point, there is always someone choosing what is available to us for viewing; opting against net neutrality dilutes this into many, many more hands than the government, which is certainly preferable for the pursuit of freedom of speech and internet content availability.-For innovation: let me rephrase. These are different and are considered different by ISPs because they use differing amounts of bandwidth. Stipulating disconnects between descriptive and normative statements will not eliminate the technological differences between each of these; Opposition is essentially avoiding the recognition that there is a reason for ISPs to regard each uniquely. Just as we place prices on items in stores based off of the cost of production, ISPs place costs on types of data because of cost to supply it.-With regards to regulations in Europe: There most certainly are net neutrality regulations in place in Europe [3,4,5]. Further, by regulations in Europe, I am referring additionally to the European regulation framework that establishes public broadband as a public utility; the service-based competition system established by law has resulted in a system where no new investment or infrastructure is introduced into the system, causing a net loss in innovation. Broadband investment per household in the US is twice that in Europe; coverage is better; and basic broadband is cheaper in the US than in Europe [8,9]. The discrepancy between your statistics and mine can be found in the fact that the cost comparison of broadband in Europe is strictly for broadband, not a bundle of broadband, TV, and phone, which appears to be the focus of your cited statistics. France is the sole exception here; France actually has exceptional broadband services nd prices relative to the rest of Europe.Householda) ISPs may adopt any model of pricing they decide upon; they are independent businesses supplying a service to a consumer. I would contend that net benefits would be achieved in rejecting net neutrality, which I feel I have made sufficiently clear.b) My claims have been justified; the sources included in my last argument confirm this. Further, Opposition is being selective in quoting my arguments. I concede that both allow for lessening of congestion; I also state \u201cA rejection of net neutrality would result in an immediate solution; the institution of net neutrality legislation allows for solution, but depends on action by ISPs independent of legislation, and thus cannot be said to have solvency. Thus, a rejection of net neutrality holds sway here as solvency for network congestion falls in favor of a rejection of net neutrality in this debate.\u201d Thus I hold net benefits here stronger than Opposition\u2019s case does.-I feel I have sufficiently responded to each argument presented by the Opposition. However, I also feel the Opposition has not presented a case worthy of a win. Based off of the resolution, Opposition is tasked with arguing in favor of net neutrality; Opposition has failed to present any substantial arguments in favor of network neutrality, including why ISPs should not be able to engage in independent business models. Net benefits requires Opposition to create a clear image of how net neutrality is beneficial, not simply to attack the status quo. Should we not see this stance develop, it is impossible to assign net benefits to Opposition.Sources:[1] http://www.nytimes.com...

For my argument I have three reasons: 1. ISPs will have more control over the Internet without Net Neutrality. 2. Net Neutrality is the freedom of speech. 3. Without Net Neutrality, the Internet will be more expensive. REASON ONE With Net Neutrality in place, ISPs can't control who goes in the fast lane or not. This makes certain that everyone surfs at the same speeds and nobody goes slower than anyone else. Without Net Neutrality, ISPs can control you and how fast your browser loads, which sites you can go to, how you operate... Without Net Neutrality, ISPs control everything. The worst part is that you don't even know if your ISP is slowing you down. All ISPs can do anything and hide it. \"A widely cited example of a violation of net neutrality principles was the Internet service provider Comcast's secret slowing (\"throttling\") of uploads from peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) applications by using forged packets. Comcast did not stop blocking these protocols, like BitTorrent, until the Federal Communications Commission ordered them to stop. In another minor example, The Madison River Communications company was fined US$15,000 by the FCC, in 2004, for restricting their customers' access to Vonage, which was rivaling their own services. AT&T was also caught limiting access to FaceTime, so only those users who paid for AT&T's new shared data plans could access the application. In July 2017, Verizon Wireless was accused of throttling after users noticed that videos played on Netflix and YouTube were slower than usual, though Verizon commented that it was conducting \"network testing\" and that net neutrality rules permit \"reasonable network management practices\"\" (Wikipedia). ISPs blocking websites brings me to my second argument... REASON TWO Repealing Net Neutrality violates the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" This should have forced the government to keep Net Neutrality in place, noting that repealing Net Neutrality is respecting that these ISPs can prevent many from reading the news, articles, forums, and statements made on the internet. Not only does repealing Net Neutrality go against freedom of speech, it goes against all of Amendment I. Stopping freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right for people to assemble, and petitioning the government for a redress. This goes directly against the amendment, so even if there was any good to repealing Net Neutrality, our government can't do it. REASON THREE With Net Neutrality replaced, ISPs can make you pay more for absolutely anything. For instance, an ISP could slow down everyone's traffic, resulting in hundreds of people paying more for a faster internet. With a slower internet, people using a browser for \"quick awnsers\" would come to an end. The internet would be greatly affected in ways nobody wants. Another way for the internet to become more expensive is if an ISP forced you to pay to enter sites. \"Americans' average wealth tops $301,000 per adult, enough to rank us fourth on the latest Credit Suisse Global Wealth report. But that figure doesn't tell you how the middle class American is doing. Americans' median wealth is a mere $44,900 per adult -- half have more, half have less\" (CNN). If ISPs started forcing you to pay, many Americans would have to stop using the internet. Not to mention ISPs could start attempting to DDoS each other, fighting for a way to hack into an opponent's system. There, they could slow down all of their customer's internet traffic and block sites they go to. Hackers could also try to do this too, and create fraud ISPs to control others. Repealing Net Neutrality would open the doors to more internet crime, and affect how the internet works from now on. Therefore, I still stand by my argument that repealing Net Neutrality is a negative.", "qid": 46, "docid": "1f1620a4-2019-04-18T11:54:27Z-00001-000", "score": 9.282600402832031}, {"content": "Title: The US government should implement a Net Neutrality policy. Content: \"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the FCC lacks authority to require broadband providers to give equal treatment to all Internet traffic flowing over their networks.

That is, there is no means nor possibility for tiered speeds of access. Essentially the debate boils down to what is ISP property when dealing with the Internet and should these property owners have a say in how their property is used. While most of the code and communication protocols used to develop web pages are open sourced, i.e., free for use by the release into public domain, the physical components are decidedly not free. Servers, the specialised hardware that allows content to be available must be bought, owned and maintained. Likewise the infrastructure used by ISPs to allow access, the cables, satellites, wireless transmitters must be bought, owned, serviced and maintained. The servers, the ISPs, the end user at home, all use property, property that is rightfully owned, to cumulate in the experience of being able to access the Internet. It is decidedly not a free enterprise. The Internet is decidedly not a public domain, despite rhetoric to the opposite attempting to assert as such. ISPs build and maintain networks because they are profitable. It's why access speeds have increased through the use of new technology. Verizon, for example, is laying new fiber optic components at an estimated cost of 18 billion. http://seekingalpha.com... ISPs profit by charging Web content providers and Web surfers for access to their lines. These profits then go towards the increased infrastructure of the ISP, whether by expanding the reach or the upgrading of the infrastructure in place. It is precisely this system that allows the type of access and reach available now. Net neutrality seeks to undermine this. An ISPs infrastructure, their property, is theirs to use and profit from as they like. Net neutrality is quite simply, a call for private property violation. The Internet is not public property; the Internet is a system of privately owned personal computers, servers, cable and satellites. Because data is transmitted through private property, the call for net neutrality is an attack on the rightful ability of an ISP to use the property it owns as it sees fit. Under threat of government force, an ISP under net neutrality, must remain passive with regard to how data flows through the networks and lines they own. This includes web content providers who under FCC proposed legislation would not be charged differentially, regardless of the volume they bring. http://www.fee.org... http://www.netcompetition.org... ISPs are profit motivated. That is, they seek to formulate the best user experience for as many of its consumers as possible. By forcing an ISP to treat all data neutrally, the FCC and net neutrality advocates desire to prevent that ISP from enacting policies, offering services, and using technology in regards to its own judgements and business models. As such an ISP would be unable to offer services, or formulate policies that would be tailored to and beneficial for consumers (and from that beneficial to the ISP which in turn funnels back into consumer end usage). Certain real time applications benefit from smooth data flow e.g., streaming video, on-line gaming, VoIP or applications such as Skype. Under net neutrality such requirements from users cannot be tailored to consumers, that is, if net neutrality is in place, then all data is treated equal in terms of priority, which includes data that does not require streaming e.g., email (for example a hospital wishing to invest in a package that allows high quality video streaming for operations would be disallowed under most models of net neutrality - at best at non discriminatory policy based FCC approved rates i.e., not tailored). An unregulated ISP has the ability to offer tailored services to those who need it. Net neutrality says nay and that an ISP must treat all users as equal regardless of usage or consumer desire; in other words, all data must be treated equally regardless of content. It really is no different than paying for premium cable TV services, express mail delivery and the like. The fears that net neutrality advocates bring are unfounded. The call for net neutrality is nothing more than the call for ISPs to be public servants of the population they sought to provide value for. Let's say you have a website which you just bought called debate.org. It is very important to you, and you are willing to pay a premium price to your ISP to get a prioritised connection which makes the site load faster. Should you be able to purchase such priority service from an ISP? Net neutrality of course says no. Net neutrality simply stifles the idea of a consumer base of contractual arrangements between those seeking value for value. == 1. Net neutrality will encourage and protect innovation and competition That unregulated Internet will stifle competition is found false simply through the rise of Internet use itself i.e., an unregulated Internet is what brought such ventures mentioned to the fore to begin with. The ability for an ISP to tailor access to consumer bases is irrelevant to any one enterprising idea. Servers are not ISPs, servers must likewise rent to ISPs to allow access to their content - no process that invokes suppression of services there. The fear mongering completely ignores that ISPs must run as a business under competing enterprises and that supplying services to customer bases is in their best interest. Providing for mass end users is simply good business practice and nothing about a deregulated Internet changes that. What net neutrality will do however is stifle those services that require or show preference to high quality streaming - streaming that many services use, streaming that many people are probably willing to pay premium access for. Claims of flexibility are likewise false, since the FCC policies are precisely designed to enforce static methods. 2. Internet Protocol Standards Such protocols are open for use, design and improvement by anyone. It is unrelated to ISP management of data transfer. Enforcing a static system is anathema to network advancement, explicitly contrary to your prior point. Many protocol standards are already inherently error prone, net neutrality will not change this. It will stifle the ability of ISPs to invest in for example, CO-mode. http://www.netcompetition.org... 3. Free exchange of information, and rights of the consumer Nothing about deregulated Internet implies ISPs will act like China. They have no reason to censor information. The FCC under net neutrality however can. As for ISPs that monitor traffic, that is irrelevant to net neutrality. It is simply a contractual issue between end user and service provider. Comcast throttled torrents because the video downloads took up a large % of bandwidth which affected non bittorrent users. AT&T reports 5% of users using > 50% of bandwidth capability. ISPs property the traffic is being sent through, so their right to prioritise data. Doing so allowed them to not increase fees to cover otherwise resulting costs. http://www.infoworld.com...", "qid": 46, "docid": "91bf368f-2019-04-18T18:58:56Z-00004-000", "score": 9.230799674987793}, {"content": "Title: The USFG should reject Net Neutrality. Content: Network Neutrality -Network neutrality, or net neutrality as it is more commonly known, is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differently by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or modes of communication. Essentially, the stance that ISP\u2019s (Internet Service Providers, such as Comcast, Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.) shouldn\u2019t be able to charge users based on what sites they want access to, what type of content they view, whether or not they play online games that use high amounts of content, etc. One of the foremost arguments proponents of net neutrality present is that of an open internet. - Open Internet-where policies such as equal treatment of data and open web standards allow those on the Internet to easily communicate and conduct business without interference from a third party. -Closed Internet-where established corporations or governments favor certain uses; may have restricted access to necessary web standards, artificially degrade some services, or explicitly filter out content. [1, 2, 3] In this debate, I am going to clearly show that net neutrality does not, in fact, result in a more open internet, but actually takes steps towards a closed internet. 1. Net Neutrality Stifles Innovation -Net neutrality proponents rally to phrases like \u201cequal treatment\u201d and \u201cending discrimination in transmitting content,\u201d all of which sound positive, but in reality threaten innovation, efficiency, and the expansion of Internet access. -First, is simply isn\u2019t accurate to treat all Internet content equally. An online calculator, a funny home video, and an e-Book all use similar amounts of Internet space comparably, yet are obviously not equal in importance, and should not be treated as such. Second, what precisely does it mean to \u2018end discrimination in transmitting content?\u2019 Net neutrality proponents would argue that to be able to charge more for one type of content than another is discrimination. Once again, it is often the case that the contents ARE different, and thus rightfully treated so. Playing PTP (peer-to-peer) games online use massively greater amounts of content than does, say, a simply Google search; net neutrality would treat the two of these equally. So, for example, let\u2019s say we have a house with six people, all of whom share the same Internet. Four of them love playing PTP games, to the point where the other two house members cannot even complete a simple Google search without their Internet being obscenely slow because of the other four members. Now let\u2019s expand this example to an entire community. ISP\u2019s being able to charge based on the amount of content users consume simply means that consumers are paying proportional to what they want, instead of everyone paying the same amount but using disproportionate amounts of content. -In fact, similar regulations are in place in Europe. The result can be clearly seen: they have raised prices and limited consumer access to the Internet. And make no mistake, this isn\u2019t because the service is better over there; broadband services are significantly cheaper in the US despite the fact that we already provide high-speed service at more than double the rate of European countries [4]. Quite simply, regulations stifle the market and economy. What net neutrality is pushing for will result in regulation levels on technology companies on par with that on water and telephone companies, eliminating their ability to innovate in the market. 2. Net Neutrality Actually Stifles Freedom of Speech -Another argument presented by defenders of net neutrality is that it \u2018protects freedom of speech\u2019 through unrestricted Internet access. This is patently false; first off, a lack of net neutrality hasn\u2019t caused a restriction of freedom of speech. Allowing ISP\u2019s to charge differing amounts for different amounts of usage is not going to restrict the freedom of speech of users; you don\u2019t have to pay for content levels for PTP games in order to post online or send an email (the \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 claimed to be violated without net neutrality). -Second, anyone claiming that new net neutrality regulations through the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) will result in \u2018greater freedom of speech\u2019 is frankly either lying or greatly deluded. The FCC isn\u2019t exactly in the business of promoting freedom of speech. In fact, they do quite the opposite-the FCC censors content it feels inappropriate, harmful, and virtually anything else it decides it doesn\u2019t want available. The FCC has never and will never stand for freedom of speech. Net neutrality regulations simply give the FCC, and subsequently the government, more control over the Internet and what exactly is available to us. In the pursuit of a freer Internet, we would actually be creating a less free one. An extreme example of this is China\u2019s strict regulation of communication companies, which has choked off many citizen\u2019s Internet access and significantly reformed the Internet available to the rest. Swiss analyst Gianluigi Negro argues that \u201cunder the guise of allegedly ensuring a free and open Internet, some Americans may unwittingly be on the road to ceding power to forces that can use the Internet against them, as is seen in China every day\u201d [5]. Don\u2019t misunderstand, this is not to suggest that the institution of network neutrality laws will have the immediate or definite result of turning America into a communistic nation. However, each new network neutrality law creates an even stronger precedent for government control and regulation of the Internet and subsequent available content. 3. Net Neutrality Infringes On Competition -Advocates of net neutrality such as Lawrence Lessig have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors [6]. A common example of this is Comcast\u2019s blocking of torrenting sites which sport pirated content [7]. It is also argued that by allowing ISP\u2019s to block out competitors from their users, we are promoting monopolies. -First, it is the prerogative of ISP\u2019s to block illegal and pirated content. In fact, arguing this as a supporting factor for net neutrality is quite ludicrous, as the FCC and government at large is greatly engaged in the prevention of piracy. Thus, ISP\u2019s pursuing this on their own independent of government regulation is rather beneficial to the FCC and society. -Second, in terms of promoting monopolies, it really doesn\u2019t. Net neutrality laws are not going to eliminate monopolies such as Comcast; anti-trust regulations would be required for that. Really all net neutrality does is make it harder for startup communication companies just entering the market to become successful, actually hardening monopolies in the long run. Further, it is entirely within the scope of a company/ISP to restrict access to competitor\u2019s content or specific sites it doesn\u2019t want to give access to. In fact, it\u2019s good business, and common in the marketplace. Further, such restrictions by monopolies or large ISP\u2019s actually makes the dissolution of monopolies more likely, as smaller startup companies would receive more subscribers and users as they became more restricted by the larger providers. In the end, the market regulates itself better than the FCC can possibly hope to. -It is important to note that a lack of net neutrality laws doesn\u2019t infringe on the consumers access to Internet. It simply means they pay for the access they want. Whatever access they don\u2019t have, they aren\u2019t paying for. Sources: [1] - http://en.wikipedia.org... [2] - http://www.savetheinternet.com...

Entrepreneurs often experiment with new and different business models -- e.g. prioritizing network traffic -- to lower prices and improve customer experience. Lariat Wireless, for example, a small internet service provider (\"ISP\") in Wyoming, forbids its customers from operating servers, to reduce network congestion and improve the overall experience for their users. Brett Glass, the CEO, explains: \"most Internet users would not know what a server was if it bit them, and they have no problem uploading content to a Web site such as YouTube for distribution. This means customers that do need to operate a server could obtain that capability by paying a bit more to cover the additional cost.\" Under a net neutrality law, however, Lariat Wireless would be forced to shift \"everyone to the more expensive plan. We will therefore be less competitive, offer less value to consumers and especially less value to economically disadvantaged ones.\" [1] Moreover, current antitrust laws are enough to protect consumers from anticompetitive practices. The net neutrality debate turns on the idea that there are bottlenecks on the Internet which allow network owners to exercise market power. For example, if a local telephone company has a monopoly in broadband access and it blocks broadband subscribers from using an Internet phone service offered by a rival company, that could harm both competition and consumers. But that's a classic antitrust issue. And under current antitrust laws, Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that's illegal if it harms consumers and competition. FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell notes that \"in the almost nine years since [net neutrality] fears were first sewn, net regulation lobbyists can point to fewer than a handful of cases of alleged misconduct, out of an infinite number of Internet communications. All those cases were resolved in favor of consumers under current law.\" [2] There is simply no reason to prefer displacing the antitrust laws -- flexible, nuanced, fact-based enforcement -- with a rigid net neutrality regime.

Content: What Pro is failing to understand is that you can either have or not have net neutrality. There is no 'in between'. So therefore by not requiring net neutrality, it is the same as banning it, for you will still have less competition, small businesses, innovation, and privacy without REQUIRING net neutrality. REFUTES 1) An unregulated Internet is better than a regulated Internet. My opponent was stating that a good internet is \"shaped by intense competition and rampant growth\". But judge, as I mentioned, net neutrality will HELP! It will lead to more competition, innovation, and small businesses. This will help our economy and the growth of the Internet, which therefore turns this point invalid. 2) Net Neutrality doesn't distinguish between pro competitive and anticompetitive practices. Judge, this point is basically that it will be harming all discriminatory practices. But here is why this is not a concern - we have been working with net neutrality for years, and it has increased the global market and been beneficial for our economy and businesses . So whether or not there is no difference between the quoted 'discriminatory practices' there will be a benefit for the people, and therefore it is worth it. 3) Current antitrust laws are enough to protect consumers and competition. They are NOT! Not having net neutrality would actually harm competition, because by giving big ISPs the power to block their competitors' websites, people would not have access to more than one big service without paying more r,many therefore there would be no need for competing. According to Forbes, if there was no net neutrality, many businesses would not exist die to the lack of competition. And it would hurt the consumers to not have this as well. Without net neutrality, your internet providers will be able to charge you EXTREMELY high prices for a free and open Internet, which is one of the greatest privileges of our time. So by having much higher prices, and lower quality service, not having net neutrality will hurt us, the consumers. Therefore, this point is false and invalid.

My reasons for this are as follows: 1. The repeal of net neutrality eliminates regulations on ISPs, helping that sector of the economy grow. 2. A lot of the worries advocates of net neutrality have are rather unrealistic or void of any economic sense. REASON NUMBER ONE: Getting rid of net neutrality will get rid of a slew of harmful regulations on ISPs and help the free market take care of the internet, as it should. To see the effects this will have, we must examine what regulations occur under title II (AKA net neutrality). Under net neutrality, ISPs must submit any ideas for a \"new technology or business model\" to the FCC. This regulation greatly hampers any upcoming innovation, harming the internet economy. This isn't even the least of it though. The FCC also has the power to \"partially regulate the capital investment of existing companies\" and decide what companies can enter the ISP market. Yes, the FCC can decide what companies can become ISPs, which means that this \"monopoly\" problem constantly brought up by opponents of the repeal is more likely to happen under net neutrality, considering that business-stifling regulation blocks potential new ISPs from entering the market. The American Action Forum states that this puts a trillion dollars of GDP and 2.5 million jobs under a \"regulatory regime\". Repealing net neutrality will get rid of these harmful restrictions and bring freedom back into the free market. This will take away barriers against innovation, barriers against investment, barriers against entry into the ISP market (which limits consumer choice), and to top it all off, by getting rid of excessive government regulation, we will be triggering authoritarians in the process. That is a win-win-win-win, and to reference Donald Trump, I am starting to get tired of all the winning. Other regulations that will be destroyed under this repeal include the prohibition of paid priority. Paid priority is when ISPs \"pay to have certain bits sent to computer screens at a faster rate than others\" (Daily Wire). Smaller ISPs used to use this, giving them an advantage considering they had less materials but could pay money for better speeds. Net neutrality comes into play, preventing paid priority from happening, and keeping smaller ISPs (who ironically enough, are who net neutrality advocates claim to help) from having that fighting chance in the marketplace. Because of this, consumers are placed in a lose-lose situation, in which they must choose between higher costs, or slower internet. Getting rid of net neutrality will bring paid priority back into play, giving smaller ISPs the advantage they once had. Considering that title II means the internet is a public telecommunications utility, the FCC also has power to levy taxes against ISPs. A 2014 study made the estimation that net neutrality regulations could result in as much as $45.4 billion lost in new ISP investments over the next 5 years. Tunku Varadarajan interviewed Ajit Pai, commissioner of the FCC, and gathered this: \"Among our nation\"s 12 largest internet service providers,\" he told the audience, \"domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6%, or $3.6 billion, between 2014 and 2016.\" I ask him to elaborate. \"As I\"ve seen it and heard it,\" he says, \"Title II regulations have stood in the way of investment. Just last week, for instance, we heard from 19 municipal broadband providers. These are small, government-owned ISPs who told us that \"even though we lack a profit motive, Title II has affected the way we do business.\" \" By keeping net neutrality in place, we aren\"t sticking it to the man. We aren\"t attacking those greedy corporations. We are hurting the small ISPs by levying taxes against them and taking away their special advantages and no amount of Jimmy Kimmel tyrades can change that. Repealing net neutrality can bring the good changes these smaller ISPs need. REASON NUMBER TWO: The worries of advocates for net neutrality are rather unrealistic. There are two main causes of concerns: ISPs will make you pay for certain websites, and ISPs will block access to certain websites or throttle speeds to certain websites. A tweet from \"Banksy\" states the typical worries: Twitter: $14.99 per month Snapchat: $9.99 per month Youtube: $19.99 per month Netflix: $9.99 per movie Google: $1.99 per search \"If you don't want to pay extra for your favorite sites you need to be supporting #netneutrality\". However, these claims are all false. Now if it wasn\"t for the fact that there is a 99.99% chance those numbers are made up, that might just be a convincing argument. The only problem is that it is completely lacking of any economic sense. If an ISP actually made people pay two dollars for every google search, then people would be leaving that ISP in droves in favor of a ISP with better prices. This is due to the principle of competition, a great factor in capitalist economies when it comes to keeping prices low without government intervention. Of course, there is the argument that some people only have access to one ISP, meaning they have a monopoly and can do whatever they want. This is also false. If an ISP charged prices for access to certain sites, another ISP could go into the area offering better prices, meaning a great profit for them, and horrible losses for the other ISP. The first ISP then lowers their prices to compete, resulting in a win-win for consumers, who not only have multiple choices, but lower prices. People also like to cite Portugal as an example for what the U.S. could be like without net neutrality, as they have you pay for certain packages like the social media package, the games package, or the music package. But what advocates of net neutrality don't know is that using Portugal as an argument for net neutrality is actually a pretty harmful idea, almost on the same tier as shooting yourself in the foot. Snopes put it best when stating: \"The European Union\"s Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) established net neutrality guidelines in 2015. Portugal is a member of the European Union, so its internet providers must comply.\" In other words, this apocalyptic, prepackaged, pay-to-play world we are told we are about to live in apparently happens under a country with net neutrality regulations. Besides having to pay to access certain websites, another main worry of Net Neutrality advocates is that ISPs will \"throttle\" speeds to certain websites or block access to others. The only issue with this distressed vision is that these worries have no factual or historical backing. Ian Tuttle from the National Review makes notice of the fact that when the FCC first considered net neutrality in 2010, they could only name four instances of anticompetitive behavior, all of those being relatively minor. Not only that, but cell phone networks are not subject to net neutrality-esque regulations of any kind, and they don\"t engage in such anticompetitive behavior. About a decade ago, Comcast attempted to \"throttle\" speeds (slowing down access) to certain data packets but were \"pilloried in the court of public opinion\" and quickly relented. There goes that concern! To finish my arguments, I shall make an allusion to the past. In February 2015, Net Neutrality was enacted. I do not remember having to pay for certain websites and I do not remember hearing any stories about ISPs raising the prices of entry to certain websites. I have no worries about the future of the U.S. under a net neutrality-free market economy and because of that I can see of no reason but to vote in affirmation to this resolution.

[and] prohibit the creation of a monopoly and the abuse of monopoly power.\" http://en.wikipedia.org... == Rebuttal == Pro claims that net neutrality is necessary to stop ISPs from slowing down the Internet. But the reality is much different. ISPs could only do that if there were no competition. That means they'd have to collude with each other, or have a monopoly (and abuse that monopoly power). Both of those are illegal under current antitrust laws (Section 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act). So net neutrality isn't necessary to stop ISPs from slowing down the Internet. If an ISP did slow down the Internet while charging monopoly prices, another company would provide faster service at a competitive price, and consumers would buy their Internet from the company providing faster service at a competitive price. That's how a free market works. We don't neet net neutrality laws to regulate an area that's already regulated by antitrust laws.== Argument ==The net neutrality debate turns on the idea that there are bottlenecks on the Internet which allow network owners to exercise market power. For example, if a local company has a monopoly in Internet access and blocks subscribers from using an Internet phone service offered by a rival company, that could harm both competition and consumers. The question is whether we should require net neutrality, or whether we should regulate that sort of anticompetitive practice through other means (i.e. antitrust laws).The problem with requiring net neutrality is that net neutrality doesn't distinguish between procompetitive discrimination and anticompetitive discrimination. Under a net neutrality regime, networks can't favor traffic from a patient's heart monitor over traffic delivering a music download. Or worse, networks can't restrict downright harmful traffic, such as viruses, worms, and spam. Instead, all Internet traffic must be treated equally. Antitrust laws, on the other hand, allow procompetitive discrimination while also prohibiting anticompetitive discrimination.(1) An unregulated Internet is better than a regulated Internet.The Internet has always been shaped by intense competition and rampant growth. Entrepreneurs have had the latitude to experiment with new and different business models. And as a result, in the absence of heavy government regulation, and \"due in large part to private investment and market-driven innovation, broadband in America has improved considerably in the last decade. More Americans are online at faster speeds than ever before.\" [1]Rigid net neutrality laws would change that. Instead of allowing the free market to guide investment dollars where needed, and allowing businesses to act based on the best use of scarce resources like bandwidth, the government would dictate many of these decisions, chilling competition, growth, and innovation.(2) Net neutrality doesn't distinguish between procompetitive and anticompetitive practices.Entrepreneurs often experiment with new and different business models -- e.g. prioritizing network traffic -- to lower prices and improve customer experience. Lariat Wireless, for example, a small internet service provider (\"ISP\") in Wyoming, forbids its customers from operating servers, to reduce network congestion and improve the overall experience for their users. Brett Glass, the CEO, explains: \"most Internet users would not know what a server was if it bit them, and they have no problem uploading content to a Web site such as YouTube for distribution. This means customers that do need to operate a server could obtain that capability by paying a bit more to cover the additional cost.\" Under a net neutrality law, however, Lariat Wireless would be forced to shift \"everyone to the more expensive plan. We will therefore be less competitive, offer less value to consumers and especially less value to economically disadvantaged ones.\" [2]Unregulated markets give entrepreneurs the latitude to experiment as such, producing procompetitive outcomes: more options, lower prices, and better quality services. But a net neutrality requirement would categorically condemn all discriminatory practices, without distinguishing the good, procompetitive ones from the bad, anticompetitive ones.(3) Current antitrust laws are enough to protect consumers and competition.Antitrust laws protect consumers from anticompetitive business practices -- monopolization, collusion, price-fixing, etc. Under these laws, courts ask whether there's been actual harm to consumers or competition before condemning a business practice. If there's been a showing of harm to consumers or competition, then the company harming the consumer or competition faces heavy fines and even prison. This approach is more nuanced, fact-based, and flexible, and it's better for the economy because it gives entrepreneurs latitude to experiment.Pro says that ISPs could slow down the Internet and force content providers to pay for so-called \"fast lanes.\" But if that actually harms competition or consumers, it's already illegal under current antitrust laws. An FCC Commissioner, Robert McDowell, even notes that \"in the almost nine years since [net neutrality] fears were first sewn, net regulation lobbyists can point to fewer than a handful of cases of alleged misconduct, out of an infinite number of Internet communications. All those cases were resolved in favor of consumers under current law.\" [3] There is simply no reason to prefer displacing the antitrust laws -- flexible, nuanced, fact-based enforcement -- with a rigid net neutrality regime.Sources:[1] http://transition.fcc.gov...[2] http://judiciary.house.gov...[3] In re Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Indus.

Content: \"This debate is about what the Internet will become in the years to come\" No it's a debate about FCC regulating ISPs in regards to access rates with users and what business plans they can entail. I've already pointed out the falsity of such statements in the prior round. It remains an ipse dixit claim bordering on fear mongering. It ignores the nature of what the Internet is, what property is and seeks to void the proper use of an ISPs property. \"Let's look at the Verizon example given\" Strawman. The argument detailing the expenditure of Verizon dealt with that the ISP themselves provide the infrastructure, including the upgraded technology. Nor did I argue that net neutrality makes such ventures unprofitable. What net neutrality does is explicitly reduce the available income of an ISP by denying it the ability to tailor access rates to customer supply. The corollary of that is that under net neutrality, fees of *all* users must then account for the discrepancy in profit margin in relation to infrastructure growth. It makes all the payers for the benefit that only some want. That's the issue there. Even so such arguments from profit amount to little more than red herrings. What one may do rightfully with ones property is unrelated to any profit they garner from such as an arbiter. \"Making your network faster, advancing your network, will be met enthusiastically by consumers, and is not undermined by net neutrality.\" Absolutely it is. The available income diminishes exponentially once you implement net neutrality as a *price control mechanism* for ISPs which is an *explicit* goal of net neutrality. To state this will have zero effect on an ISPs ability to expand current infrastructure and invest in new technology that will grant greater access speed is simply ignorant. Net neutrality denies tailoring plans, i.e., variance in priced plans that relate to access rates. It demands that access rates are indeterminate by use. That means heavy use cannot be charged accordingly for those wishing to pay, it means those wishing to pay for stable high access speeds cannot. It means the cost of users who do use high amounts of data transfer must be costed by all. If, as was the case with Comcast, an ISP is forced to devote a large portion of its bandwidth to a minority of its customer base, it is overall not being used profitably. The fallout of making an ISP's property less profitable, under government force, is the reduction of incentive to increase its bandwidth capacities by investing in more property and likewise innovative technology or services. \"dumb internet\" Net neutrality advocates a 'dumb' or stupid Internet - one unregulated by an intelligence that might favor the transmission of some content over other content. It's simply another way of saying no priority can be given to data over any other. However to advocate such a thing one must ignore what the Internet is, namely, transmission of data across private property. Data is transmitted through the infrastructure of ISPs (explicitly their private property) all the cables, computers, maintenance and infrastructure that make the Internet **possible at all.** The \"stupid\" Internet of net neutrality advocates is explicitly one in which ISPs must, under threat of government force, remain passive to how data flows through their infrastructure. \"consumers would be unable tailer their internet for their use .\" Irrelevant. The call for net neutrality is the ability to administer controls *to the ISP* not the end user. Customisation of user preferences only relates to how ISPs have the ability to manage their data transfer. The ability for an ISP to offer a premium rate of access to customers willing to pay is not analogous to the end user changing their router settings. Just like the ability to have express mail delivery services is unrelated to when you decide to post a package. \"My opponent seems to leave out the fact that for those servers to be accessed, people need to go through ISPs.\" I think you'll find I mentioned such fact several times. Such as net neutrality neutralising an ISPs ability to charge differentiated prices to servers of varying size requirements. \"consumer traffic for the benefit of their bank accounts is directly related to the entrepreneurial nature of the internet\" Again, unrelated to how business interests work, the history of the Internet itself showing explicitly contrary. The fear mongering is still ipse dixit. \"allowing competing services primarily operating out of a garage , or teaming multi billion dollar companies to crush their competition?\" I'm saying irrelevant. That's the point. Servers require ISPs. End users require servers and ISPs. ISPs require end users and servers. ISPs aren't blocking servers apart from ones related to illegal activity and have no business interest in doing so. Again, still irrelevant to private property violation and net neutrality itself. \"ISPs are profit motivated.\" Of course. They are a business. None of this has to do with validating net neutrality - freezing the ability of ISPs to tailor data priority if they so choose, across property they own. \"who owns the Internet.\" I covered this already in R1. Source code and protocols are for the majority, open source. ISP infrastructure - private, servers - private, end user hardware - private. \"Should we allow the Internet to be controlled by companies\" Equivocation. Data is transmitted through private property. \"the 5 or so network service providers that control the Backbone of the Internet, would control access to the entire network.\" If by access you mean ISPs are ISPs, then yes they are. That ISPs may discriminate data content and charge premium rates for it is their right as a business. Again no different from say, cable TV services. Net neutrality however denies customers willing to have premium access at their choosing and ISPs from offering it. \"we inhibit future improvements and adaptations.\" Under FCC regulations, such innovation would be likely barred, seeing as it amounts to *variance in data* which is what net neutrality explicitly denies. Unregulated, people are free to innovate and support what they deem fit. As has been the cases up to now. An ISP that doesn't provide access is not a successful ISP. Largely irrelevant though. \"ISPs thus have every reason to censor and favor certain information, competitors, and sites.\" Why censor when you can charge differentiating rates? Again, an ISP that does not provide services to end users isn't a successful one. There is no valid reason to assume an ISP will run as an authoritarian regime that denies access to content. A point which again is irrelevant to net neutrality which deals with data prioritisation and not, content availability. Nothing about the FCC's net neutrality regards base censorship. Net neutrality is about *how* data is transmitted. Not what. http://www.fee.org... http://www.naviganteconomics.com... \"This is completely false and baseless claim.\" They are already doing it with radio and TV 'balanced view' proposed regulation. There's nothing to suggest they consider the Internet any differently in terms of media. \"ISPs being peering into your packets, building online profiles of you, and selling it to the highest bidder, is in no way being indifferent to the contents of those packets.\" Again, irrelevant to net neutrality. It's purely a contractual issue between end user and provider.", "qid": 46, "docid": "91bf368f-2019-04-18T18:58:56Z-00002-000", "score": 9.029399871826172}, {"content": "Title: The US shouldn't require net neutrality. Content: Judge, is it fair to let certain internet companies only allow people with similar political views, or block their competitors sites? Is it fair to let big companies invade your privacy and crush small businesses? If you answered \"no\" to any of these questions, judge, then you technically agree with me on the fact that net neutrality is good. 1) Net neutrality stimulates competition. Judge, if we ban net neutrality the big ISPs, or Internet Service Providers, would be able to block competitor\"s websites. That way the big companies would be unable to compete with each other because people could not access more than one big service without paying more, and therefore there would be no need for competing. According to the New York Times, competition stimulates innovation, or the invention of new products, which we will not get without net neutrality. According to Forbes, if net neutrality didn\"t exist, many small internet providers would not exist due to the lack of competition. Nobody would be competing with each other so nobody would want to switch to new providers. The impact of this, judge, is that with no competition there will be a lot less innovation, which means less ideas and new products. This will impact the ENTIRE population, because they all rely on new technology and keeping up with the fast pace of innovation. 2) Net neutrality helps small businesses. Judge, if we ban net neutrality internet providers will be able to pick which sites show up first, and ban or block websites that they don\"t want their customers to see. Small businesses will not be top priority on these providers\" lists and may even be banned, therefore leaving them unable to get off of the ground. According to the New York Times, Google was a small buisness built in a GARAGE. It is now a huge thing that has advanced technology greatly. However, without net neutrality, the next Google will not be able to make it. According to Marvin Ammori, a technology expert and Yale professor, if there were to be no net neutrality, high class providers such as Comcast and Verizon could sell special treatment to their favorite web companies like Google and Netflix, and charge extra fees to deliver their online videos and other content at fast speeds. However, it could block small websites with things so trivial as opposing political views and the sites that show up first after a search will OBVIOUSLY be the favorites of the ISPs\", and the small businesses that may be more relevant to the search will be left in the dust. The impact of this, Judge, is that without small businesses, any new ideas, such as Google, will not be able to move past the special treatment of ISPs and will forever remain unheard. And just like our point on competition, no new ideas means less innovation, which affects the ENTIRE population. 3) Not having net neutrality would mean an invasion of your privacy. Judge, let me explain this to you. People like to encrypt, or code, many things, from emails to personal information like credit card numbers. However, according to the Economist, without net neutrality the FCC has no rules against decrypting this information. Because of the fact they they want complete control over everything they use in their service, big internet providers will have the power to decode any encryptions placed by their customers. Judge, this means they have access to YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION! This is a HUGE invasion of privacy! Access to this type of thing should be very limited, and your information should be only visible to you. How can we let our privacy be invaded like that, Judge? We have the right of privacy, as stated in the Constitution, and we cannot allow this to be taken away by ISP companies? And not only that, but to give you better results internet companies can literally track and watch everything you do online. The impact of this judge, is greater than anything possible! It impacts nearly every adult on this planet! All these people, judge, will have access to anything they want. The only other people on this planet with that type of power are high up government officials, and even THEY need a search warrant. In conclusion, if you want a more innovative, successful economy, and more privacy and free speech on the Internet, AND less discrimination between big ISP companies, then vote for Con and support Net Neutrality.

Content: \"Small chunks of arguments were taken.\" No. My quotation only serves to orient the reader to the relevant paragraph. If a reader wants to read the whole paragraph they can in your round. It doesn't serve my needs to undercut my character count by spamming your statements. \"This was in an attempt to create the illusion of this case being completely torn apart.\" No. It's how I debate. Fallacies are called out for the fallacies they are. \"had the definition of net neutrality shifted to try to invalidate the argument\" You defined it round R1. Your definition was not 'all concerns I have about the Internet ever' - Your definition dealt with data transfer, \"send and receive\". I expounded the relevance of that, you never challenged that at all. The resolution includes USG, that means the FCC and what the FCC talks about in regards to net neutrality. I provided numerous sources that detailed what net neutrality actually is, especially as it relates to the FCC, and constitutional law. It is not my problem that you are apparently largely unaware of what net neutrality advocates actually propose. You are the one that went tangential to the definition into a number of irrelevancies relating to net neutrality such as data mining profiles. The definition didn't allow it. The FCC proposals have nothing to do with the tangential arguments you made, nor do net neutrality advocates when they talk of net neutrality. It is an issue of preferencing data transmission over other data. I suggest you read the FCC report itself aka \"the solution in search of the problem\". Turning net neutrality amorphously into 'all concerns' as you appear want, simply destroys any definition being valid at all. The definition you gave was fully compliant with the arguments I made, and what the FCC proposal was and is. The issue is you attempting to extend it beyond the scope of net neutrality. It is, in the FCC's own words, that \"discrimination\" should be barred. That means, the inability of ISPs to freely offer preferential services, to be freely paid for by consumers. hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-09-93A1.pdf \"send and receive packets using the Internet in a way that is indifferent to the contents, source or destination of the packets.\" Despite denying what I claim, and despite attempting to utilise that definition otherwise, it's quite clear that what it *does* detail is prohibition of preferential treatment. As explained numerous times already, preferential treatment relates the content access of the data being transmitted, or in the FCC's words \"To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice ... to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network\". It is exactly the proposal, as argued, that net neutrality seeks to deny the ability of ISPs to tailor bandwidth priority. Corollary to that (that's why it doesn't need to be spelt out), is the prohibition for an ISP to offer services that lead to differential treatment of data (see your definition again) in relation to bandwidth speed and services. It absurdly clear what the intent is, because the FCC attempted to prosecute Comcast for exactly doing that. To state that that is not net neutrality requires a gross equivocation. \"In doing so, my opponent has granted the arguments on a technical basis, opposing them only morally on the basis of the private property argument.\" False dichotomy. The issue you consistently ignored is that it is *private property* which means any technical formulations must *first* be reconciled within that framework. It does not make your argument valid simply because I didn't argue 'technology will X' - if you read R1 & R2 I addressed the tech arguments separately anyway, namely, the concerns of protocols and data transfer issues is one in which an unregulated Internet has dealt with since its inception. Nothing about a regulated Internet will change that, other than the availability of the FCC to invalidate new protocols as it would by necessity related back to differential data transfer. Unregulated, the Internet is free to have developers change, advance, advocate and try to implement whatever new protocol procedures they please. Under net neutrality, it's questionable. All it does is bring us back to the infamous quip \"a solution in search of a problem\". \"The end-to-end design of the Internet needs to be preserved\" Contradicts your prior assertions they are free to develop then doesn't it? Again nothing about an ISP or developers is enhanced by reducing the availability of data access. Again, consistently ignored. \"ISPs have motivation to grant multi-billion dollar companies favored treatment over smaller enterprises\" No they don't. They can afford to do both. Charge for both. Companies require servers, no matter the size, which means ISPs charging differentiated rates. Under net neutrality proposals, servers can't be charged differential rates i.e., property violation. \"will be in the hands of a handful of large companies\" Equivocation. Data is transferred across property, that is what the Internet is. Nothing about net neutrality changes that unless you wish to argue full nationalisation, which you didn't. \"The Internet is a egalitarian, decentralized system for the free exchange of information.\" False. It is a system of interconnected private property developed by largely open source procedures. Try using the Internet without any recourse to private property. \"when a company sells plans that they cannot deliver on\" Contractual issues are contractual issues. Net neutrality doesn't change the nature of what a contract is. What it does is deny an ISP to tailor them in certain ways. Again, the data was being transmitted across their property. The bandwidth hog meant that prioritisation needed to occur no matter, it's not an infinite resource, so of course they chose the small % who were the ones using >50% of availability. \"I point to the definition of net neutrality\" Which is irrelevant to whether net neutrality will stifle the ability of profit motives. Which it will. I'm not sure what about preferential data transfer, which you refer to numerous times in regards to bittorrent, being disallowed, doesn't relate to net neutrality being about preferential data transfer. \"is in response to his argument of the inability to tailor access to consumer needs.\" Irrelevant. A user being able to preference one service over the other is no where near analogous to an ISP offering premium bandwidth services to that user. Just like deciding whether to post a letter today or tomorrow isn't analogous to having an express mail service available or not. \"This is the motivation of companies.\" If this was the case we would see see a vastly different Internet experience than the one we do. Asserting your position with no real relation to how the Internet is run at all doesn't help. Hence \"the solution in search of a problem\". \"You ignored the giant pipeline\" What about \"infrastructure\" evaded you? \"more profit\" Profit from denying profit making exercises? \"we must protect the Internet from being exploited.\" The Internet is not a \"thing\" in this sense. Violation of contract is related to contract law. \"buying that package from the ISP\" You pay for access to their lines to transmit/receive - not a portion of their lines in the form of property. Government violating property for another citizen's 'good' is arbitrary. The grounds to do so are not valid just by crying 'exploitation' - there is nothing exploitative about valid contracts between user and provider. All it is is an attempt to ignore that an ISP is private property, validly so, and that right to use private property, including mutual agreement to mutual benefit, exists.", "qid": 46, "docid": "91bf368f-2019-04-18T18:58:56Z-00000-000", "score": 8.989299774169922}, {"content": "Title: The US government should implement a Net Neutrality policy. Content: This debate is about what the Internet will become in the years to come; Whether it will remain an open platform for advancement, or a platform for the advancement of three or four large corporations and their partners. Let's look at the Verizon example given, they spent 18 billion on fiber optics. This statistic is supposed to make the point that these companies spend money, and that were net neutrality put into practice, this investment would be somehow become terribly unprofitable. I want to point out two aspects of the source given though. First, \"they are expected to start turning profits on their new offerings in 2009.\" 3 years, only 3 years to turn a profit on an 18 billion dollar investment. We can see the wild profitability of controlling such a large portion of our nations communication infrastructure. Net neutrality does not make this a bad investment, it doesn't make expanding a network's reach, or increasing it's capacity something that loses money, but it does ensure that while a company is expanding they don't screw the customers that are already connected. Faster connections can be bought, and people will want them. Making your network faster, advancing your network, will be met enthusiastically by consumers, and is not undermined by net neutrality. Second, \"Because many companies offer package-deals to customers which include telephone, internet and cable TV service,...\" This bundling, this use of the same infrastructure for a variety of data types, illustrates the end-to-end principle that the Internet was built on. The Internet relies on intelligent terminals, and a dumb network. By having a network that can facilitate all types of data we allow for a network like the internet. The \"smart network\" is not a positive, once the network starts telling the data what to do, we limit what the data can do. Look to the telephone network as an example. It was built to facilitate one type of data transfer at one rate that was the main of transmitting voice. Once a new way to transmit voice was found though, this network, that would make\"intelligent\" assumptions about what that data needed to do, prevented this better form of communication. Once we dethrone data as king of the network, we permanently impair the Internet's ability to adapt and improve. http://www.wordiq.com... Yes, ISPs are profit motivated. Does this mean that they will seek the best consumer experience, or that they will seek the consumer experience that best benefits themselves? The negation says that with net neutrality, consumers would be unable tailer their internet for their use. This isn't true, and again I turn to the end-to-end principle. If you've ever looked at your router settings, you'll find the ability to prioritize your traffic, to put Skype over firefox, to put one router port or device over the rest. This is the intelligent terminal of the end-to-end network. And you may say or think that this takes a high degree of technical know-how, but it doesn't, ISPs offer to guide you through this set-up already. -------- 1) Net neutrality will encourage and protect innovation and competition. There is a difference between unregulated, and decentralized. Regulation preventing the Internet from being centrally controlled is in no detrimental to the end of a decentralized network. My opponent seems to leave out the fact that for those servers to be accessed, people need to go through ISPs. The ability of ISPs to tailer shape consumer traffic for the benefit of their bank accounts is directly related to the entrepreneurial nature of the internet. Which do you think is more profitable - allowing competing services primarily operating out of a garage , or teaming multi billion dollar companies to crush their competition? Microsoft, at $224.75 billion, or Linux. Google, $163.2 billion, or askjeeves. ISPs are profit motivated. Beyond this, look at who owns the Internet. Should we allow the Internet to be controlled by companies, the 5 or so network service providers that control the Backbone of the Internet, would control access to the entire network. (http://en.wikipedia.org...) 2) IP Standards I point again to the end-to-end network design, the way ISPs handle data transfer is the foundation of these protocols. The TCP protocol is responsible for error checking, the application controls the preference of accuracy over speed or vise versa, and that protocol depends on a neutral network. Once the network starts making assumptions about how to treat data, we inhibit future improvements and adaptations. http://www.wordiq.com... (specifically the IDIOT SAVANT BEHAVIORS FOR DIFFERENT DATA TYPES section) 3) Free exchange of information, and rights of the consumer \"They have no reason to censor information.\" ISPs are profit motivated, as you said yourself. Teaming up with multi-billion dollar companies is profitable, and ISPs thus have every reason to censor and favor certain information, competitors, and sites. \"The FCC under net neutrality however can.\" This is completely false and baseless claim. \"As for ISPs that monitor traffic, that is irrelevant to net neutrality\" ISPs being peering into your packets, building online profiles of you, and selling it to the highest bidder, is in no way being indifferent to the contents of those packets. Without net neutrality, we leave the Internet open to attack.

My opponent brought up the subject of ISPs making customers pay for anything. If an ISP, say Comcast (for example), decided to make you pay money to access certain websites, people would be ditching Comcast in droves in favor of an ISP that doesn't charge money for entry to certain websites. In my opponents third contention there are a lot of ifs, ands, buts, and whats but all of these worries are made invalidated by the free market. Basic economic theory states that consumers want the best quality product for the lowest price. Slow internet is a low quality product. If companies slow down internet, consumers leave them. If they raise prices, consumers leave them. They have these market incentives to keep good speeds and low prices so other ISPs don't beat them in the marketplace. This worry of ISPs making you pay for anything is completely unrealistic. We also must think about the point made by my opponent stating that ISPs could DDoS each other. However, there is something keeping ISPs from DDoS'ing each other, and it isn't net neutrality. It is the free market. Nobody has a reason to support an ISP that launches cyber attacks on other ISPs, so they will leave that ISP. Therefore, the ISP has an incentive to not engage in such anticompetitive behavior. These fears are ridiculous. Not only that, but repealing net neutrality won't violate freedom of speech. If ISPs prevent people from reading the news, articles, forums, etc, then people will ditch that ISP. I hate repeating myself like a broken record but it is basic economic theory. Another thing we must consider is constitutionality. In that case, why aren't phone networks, who don't have net neutrality regulations being tried in the supreme court for unconstitutionality? Because they don't engage in anti competitive behavior, and the reason they don't engage in that speech-stifling behavior even though they don't have net neutrality regulations is because of basic economics (notice a theme?). From the time the internet was created to January 2015, the U.S. did not have net neutrality regulations, and no ISP made such free-speech-violating moves without being destroyed in the court of public opinion. They will always relent, so why do we need our government watchdogs constantly trailing these ISPs? My opponent's first contention is that ISPs will gain control over the internet. This is false, and my reasoning for this is... the free market! Not surprising, eh? If anything, my opponents example of Verizon conducting \"network testing\" shows another flaw with net neutrality instead of helping his case. Net neutrality does permit \"reasonable network management practices\" and this story shows that certain ISPs could find loopholes through this flimsy law. Overall, there is no reason to keep net neutrality. By keeping it, we are hampering innovation, unfairly levying taxes against ISPs, keeping new companies from joining the market, and stripping smaller ISPs of a valuable advantage. By getting rid of it, we won't be handing control of the internet to ISPs, violating the first amendment, or giving ISPs the ability to make you pay for internet services. We have no reason to keep net neutrality and a ton of reasons to repeal it.

Content: With a society that is becoming more and more connected to, and reliant on, the Internet, there is an increasing need to address the issue of net neutrality. Net neutrality is a broad term, but for this debate I propose it be limited to this definition: Net neutrality: ISPs who charge for internet access must provide a service that enables users to send and receive packets using the Internet in a way that is indifferent to the contents, source or destination of the packets. The Internet has allowed for a truly impressive growth in interconnectivity of the world, it has provided a platform for massive innovations, and has allowed for a previously unprecedented method to share and access knowledge. A fundamental part of this network is it's flexibility, openness, and standardization. Failing to protect the open nature of the Internet is to allow the slow destruction of the Internet as a platform for the innovation that has so shaped our culture. We need to protect this free transfer of information. Implementing a net neutrality policy will protect innovation, maintain the standards that have allowed the internet to become what it is today, and protect the free exchange of ideas and knowledge. 1) Net neutrality will encourage and protect innovation and competition: So many of the great stories surrounding the Internet start in garages. So many of the business that are the giants of the tech industry started with a good idea, and that's about it. The ability of an idea to grow through the Internet with little capitol is what allowed companies like Amazon, eBay and Google to survive. Ensuring the continuity of this atmosphere is vital; Without it the Internet may devolve into something like the TV industry is now, a service provided by a few giant corporations who control access and distribution of information. Maintaining the equality of the Internet is maintaining the innovation at has so driven its development. 2) Internet Protocol Standards: Certain standards maintained across the Internet are what make it such a flexible platform for innovation and discussion. Regardless of the application using it, or the infrastructure that carries it the Internet maintains certain standards of how to treat packets of information. Among these are: (http://www.dpsproject.com...) a)Transmissions are broken down into small pieces referred to as \"packets,\" comprised of small portions of the overall information useful to the users at each transmission's endpoints. A small set of data is prefixed to these packets, describing the source and destination of each packet and how it is to be treated. b)Internet routers transmit these packets to various other routers, changing routers freely as a means of managing network flow. c)Internet routers transmit packets independently of each other and independently of the applications that the packets are supporting. The prioritization or discrimination of packets implicitly favors certain designs, and damage others. The Internet depends on a neutral platform to maintain the features so central to it. 3) Free exchange of information, and rights of the consumer: By ensuring the indifferent treatment of content and destinations of connections we ensure the ability to freely share and discuss ideas. By allowing packets to be treated differently based on content or destination we open the door for massive invasions of privacy, for robbing consumers of their fair use, and for a biased view of what should be a free environment. Do you really want your ISP to be able to look at every piece of information you send and receive on the internet? Do you want what your viewing in your home to be collected, packaged, and sold to any company that wants to more effectively shove advertisements down you throat? Net neutrality will protect the privacy of the consumer and the anonymity of the Web. When you look at the actual plans we buy for internet access, you'll see something like \"15Mbps plan\", buying you this plan is buying access to up to 15Mbps of information. Practices of throttling downloads or torrents of heavy users is robbing you of what you purchased. Let's say you buy a 20Mbps plan from Comcast. You have access to 20Mbps, but let's say Comcast starts throttling bittorrent (again), so your 20Mbps becomes 5Mbps if you're using bittorrent. Allowing ISPs to throttle consumers, beyond capping their speed at what they purchased, is equivalent to theft. What if ISPs start making deals with certain companies? What if Comcast made a deal with Facebook to slowdown packets that were headed for Myspace, or Disapora, or other social networking sites? What if Microsoft had downloads of openoffice, or linux distributions slowed? This would crush the nature of the internet (not to mention the open source movement), and provide a distorted view of what should be a open environment. Net neutrality is a policy essential to the future of the Internet. We need to to foster innovation and competition. We need to maintain the standards and flexibility of the Internet that made it what it is today. We need to protect the rights, and the privacy, of American citizens. We need net neutrality.", "qid": 46, "docid": "91bf368f-2019-04-18T18:58:56Z-00005-000", "score": 8.79699993133545}, {"content": "Title: The USFG should reject Net Neutrality. Content: I find myself over the character limit, and must pick and choose my arguments (I WILL address all dropped arguments):Freedom of SpeechWith regards to the FCC not supporting freedom of speech:b) Opposition argues that \u201cnet neutrality laws do not give the government more power to control what is available to us on the Internet\u201d because the FCC isn\u2019t trying to regulate the internet itself, only the providers. This is patently false; we can look to historical examples of content-based regulation of TV and radio allowed by the Supreme Court, which stated that the FCC could restrain radio and TV broadcasters on a content-neutral basis [1]. However, the FCC was then allowed the discretion of deciding what was \u2018content-neutral.\u2019 Through this open interpretation, the FCC was able to fine or even revoke the licenses of radio and TV stations it felt were not \u2018fair and balanced,\u2019 or if the station aired profanity, hate speech or other offenses [2,3]. In regulating the way that telecommunication industries operate their Internet services through current proposed net neutrality legislation, the FCC would be given oversight of every ISP in the nation. Opposition has not objected to the fact that passing said net neutrality legislation would give the FCC precedent for the authority to regulate the internet, which is what they want-an open door to becoming a governing authority over the internet.Further supporting the FCC\u2019s lack of dedication to freedom of speech is their history of desiring to implement \u2018fairness\u2019 in all broadcasting of any sort. A major aspect of this is the Fairness Doctrine of 1949, which required holders of broadcast licenses to both present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was, in the Commission's view, honest, equitable and balanced, thus greatly curbing the freedom of speech of all those subject to its control [4]. While eliminated in 1987, it turns out that the FCC never lost the desire to institute this \u2018fairness\u2019 of coverage in the media. Last May the FCC proposed a \"Multi-Market Study of Critical Information Needs\" with the desire of determining the methods by which reporters, editors and station owners decide which stories to run [5]. The FCC stated that the goal of this study was to create guidelines to \u2018aid media sources in what they could provide that is content-neutral and fair to the public.\u2019 FCC Chairwoman Mignon Clyburn stated \u201cThe FCC has a duty to make sure that the industries it regulates serve the needs of the American public no matter where they live or what financial resources they have\u201d [5]. All of this shows the interests of the FCC in regulating media and what they are able to provide and express (a clear regulation of freedom of speech), and net neutrality legislation will only further their ability to do so. In fact, the FCC is leaning on this legislation and pushing for its passage so heavily because their success in promoting \u2018fairness\u2019 and reinstituting the fairness doctrine relies so heavily on their ability to control ISPs. In fact, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time in recent years that this doctrine has been brought to the table; in 2007 numerous Congressional Democrats, with Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer at their head, aggressively pursued the reinstatement of the fairness doctrine [6].Additionally, to enforce such \u2018fairness\u2019 as the FCC has expressed a desire to institute, the FCC would need to create guidelines to regulate search results, ensuring that an equal number of liberal and conservative views load on the same page, moving some down and some up to make the overall page \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018fair.\u2019 This clearly results in a violation of freedom of speech of a search engine\u2019s owners and those of the individual sites/articles, as their opinions and the manner in which they present them are being classified and reorganized in an arbitrary manner determined by the FCC.Further, the 5-member commission stated in their Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that two viable sources of such FCC authority over ISPs are Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and Title II of the Communications Act [7]. Title II pertains to how the FCC grants broadcast licenses; the terms of licenses, renewal processes, content restrictions, etc. The FCC having control over the licenses of all ISPs means their actions are inherently controlled by the FCC. Further, ISPs would also become subject to the FCC\u2019s Discrimination Clause [7], a part of Section 706 which states that \u201cbroadcasters must certify that they do not discriminate in the sale of advertising time\u201d [7] or of content, meaning that the FCC retains the right to determine if the agency is unduly biased and, if so found, \u2018correct\u2019 it (by revoking licenses). Similarly, Title II states that common carriers (ISPs would fall under this in net neutrality laws) can\u2019t \u201cmake any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services,\u201d which the FCC expanded in 2011 to include partisan viewpoints [3,7,8].Through all of this, it becomes quite clear that the FCC IS NOT engaged in the protection of freedom of speech. In fact, this factual evidence shows a very existent desire on the part of the FCC to obtain greater control of the internet for the purposes of normalizing opinion availability and creating a questionable \u2018fairness\u2019 which clearly infringes on freedom of speech much more than the status quo. Thus, in clear contradiction to Opposition\u2019s assertion, the enforcement of net neutrality laws DOES in fact give the government via the FCC more power to control what is available to us on the internet, and that further the FCC clearly does seek to regulate the internet through the regulation of ISPs.With regard to Opposition\u2019s objections to the example of China, point by point:b) To defend a perceived difference between the US and China, Opposition states \u201cIn China, actual website content is blocked\u201d; the FCC will have the capacity to do the very same by revoking licenses of ISPs/information providers, by applying a fairness doctrine to govern what is acceptable, and through the discrimination clause to eliminate voices not expressing all viewpoints. This is remarkably similar, though certainly not as extreme, as the censorship seen in China.c) Opposition cites a difference in socio-political situations as the reasoning for their incompatibility; however, this does not change the fact that it is inherently the desire of those officials in government to stay in power that results in such censorship and closed internet practices, which is just as existent in the US as it is in China.Net Neutrality and Competitionb) BitTorrent is a growing source of legitimate content sharing, but my point is that BitTorrent is also a major member of the pirated content market, meaning that relative to, say, SOPA, the site should be halted solely because it traffics pirated content, regardless of legal activities.c) While it is not always the goal of ISPs to halt internet piracy, it is their business to supply internet to their clients, and it is certainly within their bounds to place restrictions on the services they provide. Certainly clients may not like it if they are blocked from a particular site, but this is simply one of the reasons that individuals switch who they buy from. The Opposition has yet to argue precisely why it is not within the rights of ISPs to control what content they supply to their users-because they do.Innovationa) The value of each of these is indeed intrinsic; however, I would prefer ISPs decide what is available rather than a commission of 5 people.b) To clarify:a. Various content on the internet are different-ex., playing PTP games online eats more bandwidth than simple google searches, thus making them greatly different relative to ISPsb. They ought to be treated differently-because one uses more bandwidth than the other, bandwidth being the \u2018currency\u2019 ISPs deal in when providing service to users, it is only natural that ISPs treat the two on different levels (or pricing, should they decide)c. In Other Words-because various content on the internet are not equal in the eyes of ISPs due to the bandwidth they use or their popularity, etc., it is illogical to force ISPs to treat them identicallyWith regard to the household analogy:a) My \u2018view\u2019 is against net neutrality. This resolution does not require me to specify how the ISPs should do this; my burden of proof is simply to argue for the rejection of net neutrality. Thus, Opposition\u2019s question is non-topical.b) ISPs have not addressed internet congestion because they feel a better solution is to have clients paying for the level of data they want to use. In the Comcast article, the stated goal of restricting access to BitTorrent was to manage the network and \u201ckeep file-sharing traffic from swallowing too much bandwidth and affecting the Internet speeds of other subscribers.\u201d ISPs haven\u2019t undertaken another solution due to the enormous cost of doing so. A rejection of net neutrality would result in an immediate solution; the institution of net neutrality legislation allows for solution, but depends on action by ISPs independent of legislation, and thus cannot be said to have solvency. Thus, a rejection of net neutrality holds sway here as solvency for network congestion falls in favor of a rejection of net neutrality in this debate.Sources:[1] https://bulk.resource.org...[2] http://transition.fcc.gov...[4] http://uspolitics.about.com...[5] http://www.breitbart.com...[6] http://www.journalism.org...[7] http://www.fcc.gov...[8] http://www.dailydot.com...", "qid": 46, "docid": "f5b3410d-2019-04-18T15:41:50Z-00005-000", "score": 8.760700225830078}, {"content": "Title: The US government should implement a Net Neutrality policy. Content: Before I move onto refutations, I'd like to draw attention to the style the negations last argument adopted. Small chunks of arguments were taken, out of context of the larger argument. Those arguments were then either weakly refuted, called irrelevant despite it being brought up by the negation and being quite central to the resolution, or had the definition of net neutrality shifted to try to invalidate the argument. And don't forget the latin and logical fallacies. This was in an attempt to create the illusion of this case being completely torn apart. So first, let me restate the definition of net neutrality, as given three lines into the debate. Net neutrality: ISPs who charge for internet access must provide a service that enables users to send and receive packets using the Internet in a way that is indifferent to the contents, source or destination of the packets. Net neutrality is not access rates, it is not an \"explicit price control mechanism\", it is about how packets are treated and delivered. The neg decided to refute almost all of my points with a variation of the same argument, that being that traffic is sent over private property and thus should be allowed to be manipulated and used however the ISP wants. In doing so, my opponent has granted the arguments on a technical basis, opposing them only morally on the basis of the private property argument. To list those arguments opposed morally, thus granted technically. -The end-to-end design of the Internet needs to be preserved -ISPs have motivation to grant multi-billion dollar companies favored treatment over smaller enterprises -Control of the Internet will be in the hands of a handful of large companies that control the Backbone Network. \"It ignores the nature of what the Internet is\" The Internet is a egalitarian, decentralized system for the free exchange of information. To grant control of that system to those few companies, you must ignore the nature of what the Internet is. \"It means the cost of users who do use high amounts of data transfer must be costed by all. If, as was the case with Comcast, an ISP is forced to devote a large portion of its bandwidth to a minority of its customer base\" *This* is a contractual issue, when a company sells plans that they cannot deliver on, that being the access rate these torrenters use, the fault does not lie with those who use their package, it lies with Comcast. \"Absolutely it is. The available income diminishes exponentially once you implement net neutrality as a *price control mechanism* for ISPs which is an *explicit* goal of net neutrality.\" Again, I point to the definition of net neutrality, and this arguments nature as a contractual issue. Net neutrality is about how packets are treated and sent. If ISPs oversell their product, it is their responsibility to either handle the packages they sold, or re design those packages. \"dumb internet\" This is refuted by the private property argument, addressed lower down. \"Irrelevant. The call for net neutrality is the ability to administer controls *to the ISP* not the end user.\" The ability for customization by the end user is in response to his argument of the inability to tailor access to consumer needs. This is part of the end-to-end design, and is used to show that traffic shaping isn't needed. \"\"entrepreneurial nature of the internet\" Again, unrelated to how business interests work, \" This is the motivation of companies to side with multi-billion dollar companies over garage companies yet again. It is in the ISPs obvious benefit to side with google over that kid with an old lunix computer running a search engine to get some ad revenue. \"I covered this already in R1. Source code and protocols are for the majority, open source.\" You ignored the giant pipeline that most internet traffic will eventually flow through (see http://en.wikipedia.org...) \"Why censor when you can charge differentiating rates?\" Multi-billion dollar company = more profit The private property, and reduced income argument. Our governments responsibility is to protect its citizens. Part of this is to ensure that they are not exploited at the expense of profit. Take Goldman Sachs for example, we defiantly reduced their ability to profit by adding regulation, and preventing more of the trading that cause the economic downfall, but we did this because they were taking advantage of the consumer to make that profit. In the same vein we must protect the Internet from being exploited at the cost of the consumer in the name of profit. We are still buying that package from the ISP, and to say that ISPs are allowed to invade upon the property we have purchased in the form of data transmission, much less in the name of private property, is ridiculous. especially when this access rate argument can be negated by buying high access rate packages.

THE INTERNET WOULD BE BETTER IN THE HANDS ON INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. -Also, according to NPR(and proven from page 249 in the official net neutrality rulebook): ISPs must disclose when they are slowing down certain traffic, thus showing customer when it is happening. Thus the customer is always informed, and very little harm can come from the repeal of Net Neutrality 2. Net Neutrality is a Red Herring that Hurts Innovation: -FCC plan (pg 249.): businesses need legal/financial freedom in order to spur innovation and creativity. By encouraging network investment, consumersU94; benefit. -basically, ISPs have more power to create better service when the gov. isn\"t breathing down their necks. -to simplify this: if we repeal net neutrality, then ISPs will be able to make faster internet for everyone -a world w/out NN would actually provide better service b/c companies would have more leeway to create faster content -Fox News: no internet provider wants to be known for \"slow service,\" or being, \"anti-free speech,\" so the consumer has nothing 2 worry about. -also, why is NN so important when before it was implemented, the internet was fine with none of these, \"dire problems?\" 3. Fairness and Desirability: -lets think super logically: services that require high amounts of reliability like hospitals would do much better w/out NN -I am talking to my dr. online about a serious heart condition that I have.

THAT IS NOT THE TOPIC OF THIS DEBATE. NET NEUTRALITY IS. I believe that Net Neutrality should be spared, and should be kept away from Virgin Media's grubby, greedy hands. For those who don't know, I'll summarize net neutrality in a simple way. Net neutrality is what lets you sit at your computer, hop on the internet, and visit every site on the internet at the same speed. Now, granted it will not always be the same each visit. There is sure to be differing ammounts of content on each site your computer has to process. What Virgin Media plans to do, is 'throttle' your internet. Which means, they can tell your computer to fo fast to one site, but slow to another. And they do this because, most people would pay to be in the fast lane. They can also block access entirely to sites you normally go to, and redirect you to sites their sponsors create. Which means, if Google doesn't pay Virgin Media, typing google.com in the address bar will take you to a site like fetchfido.com, who has paid Virgin Media. The only way to get to Google, is to pay. Now, I believe the internet is the last vessel of our free speech. TV isn't. It's controlled by a group of people who care more about displaying an interesting story than the truth they promise. Same goes for newspapers/magazines. On the internet, everybody's oppinion is virtually the same. Nobody has a higher authority than another on the internet, except in a controlled situation. If Virgin Media takes that away, they're taking away one of our most primary rights.", "qid": 46, "docid": "f4864a7e-2019-04-18T19:41:08Z-00005-000", "score": 8.623299598693848}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: The government should be able to regulate the internet Content: Argument 1: In case of emergency, it is important to have the ability to regulate.

Second, it doesn't matter if you don't see the cyber terror threats. The fact is that they exist. It was exemplified by Sony, and there is proof in my evidence. Third, if you don't understand how government regulation would help, follow the link I gave in round 2 for more information. Argument 2: Net neutrality, econ Op Argument: they spy on us Response: Again, if you don't want someone spying on you, it is your duty to elect leaders who will produce anti-spying legislation. It is important that we deal with the real threat over my opponent being paranoid. My opponent has shown no evidence that the government's goal is to spy via or heavily censor the internet. Argument 3: Net neutrality, ethically Op argument: Governing isn't neutral Response: We need to look at what is definite. Right now on the internet, there is definitely a lack of net neutrality, more money equates to a larger internet presence. However, the government is an uncertainty. I think it is important to not treat the government like a foreign entity. We are electing them from us. They are not out to harm us. Additionally, when my opponent says \"It's just taking some of the power from the rich and giving all the power to the government\", he/she is mistaken. Maintaining net neutrality is about giving the rich and the poor equal opportunities on the internet. Argument 4: Protecting privacy Op Argument: Government can't be trusted with privacy. Response: Business have real interest in taking information whereas the government does not. We again need to look at what is certain. Although I disagree with this, we can call the government a maybe in terms of privacy for the sake of argument. We should trust a maybe to protect us instead of letting companies that are with certain trying to get our information succeed.

Response 1: In the case of a real threat, not always good is better than definitively bad. Even if you accept my opponent's argument that the government is not always good, when choosing between definite bad and only sometimes bad, you are going to choose the government every time. The government needs to be able to regulate in the case of cyber terror. Response 2: As citizens of the United States, we are the ones electing who will make the decisions. For this reason, we must give trust to the government as we decide its contents. The government is built on a checks and balances design. If the executive branch acts based on the wrong reasons, the legislative branch, the people we actively elect, have the power to impeach. This means that we need to trust the government to do right. Argument 2: Econ. Op response: \"I don't think government regulation is required to make the internet free.\" Response 1: My opponent clearly lacks sources. This is not a debate of opinion; this is a debate of facts. My source clearly shows a need for government regulation for maintaining net neutrality. Response 2: Net neutrality isn't just about making the internet free: it's about making it so people with more money don't have visibility on the internet. This, in fact, cannot be achieved without government regulation as it would be the large companies such as Google making these decisions, companies that have invested interest in no net neutrality. Government regulation is important for maintaining net neutrality. Argument 3: Purpose of the internet. Op response 1: People should decide the importance of the internet Response: I agree. I happen to be a person, and I believe that that is what is important about the internet. Op response 2: Online business is important. Response: Net neutrality in no way harms online business. Net neutrality would only make more fair for the smaller online business with less money. I would agree that online shopping is beneficial, though regulation in no way prevents that. Argument 4: Privacy. Op response: We can't trust the government because it spies on people. Response 1: Go back to my second response concerning my first argument. As we are the ones electing these officials, we need to trust them in order for them to do their job. If they are spying, we must trust that it is for good reason. Response 2: This is similar to my first response concerning my first argument. The companies have real interest in breaching privacy via the internet, whereas the government does not.

Contention 1: Unregulated Market is better than a Regulated market for the internet. In the current system, the internet has always been free and open. We can see that Entrapenuers have been free to do as they please and they have set reasonable prises and entry fees for the consumer. We can see that without a great amount of high internet regulation by the federal government that the internet has thrived in the current situation. Without this regulation that this resolution is purposing we can see that the internet has thrived \u201c\"due in large part to private investment and market-driven innovation, broadband in America has improved considerably in the last decade. More Americans are online at faster speeds than ever before. \" [1] So we can see that the net neutrallity will kill inovation and it does this by ending and placing a cap on speeding up the internet. [2] This is done by getting rid of the right for providers like Comcast and such to speed up the connection to websites of their cliants and this is something that destroys our very foundation of the Free Market as it does not permit for companies to use this to increase speed as this increasement of speed leads to innovation as the clients clamour for faster and faster internet connection and it\u2019s for this reason alone that the US has the fastest internet in the world, but Net Neutrality is threatening to change all of that. Under Net Neutrality the government will limit how much broadband and brandwith the companies get and this hurts the market, because now the market cannot charge for scarce resources. As economist Milton Friedman argues in his book Capitalism and Freedom, we can see that if we abolish these price controls we permit the market to show us the scarce resources and these resources cost more, but with these controls it limits the company\u2019s fixture to this issue and once again harming the economy. Let\u2019s look at DSL for example. We can see here that when this wasn\u2019t regualted that it spiked in growth and developement, but when regulations occured it stagnated dragmatically, BUT when they were removed it took off. [3] FiberBroadband Community, an internet provided in the Great Lakes region reported that under net neutrality that they would be forced to move ALL of their customers to a more expensive plan and this would hurt the business as it would cost them more, but the price for the internet would have to stay the same. Plus they are forced to keep their company running on the same expensive plan which destroys innovation as they no longer are needed to innovate to get the edge in the market since everyone has to provide the same connection plans. [6] Contention 2: Status Quo Antitrust laws solve issue. The main concern now with Net Neutrality issue is that the Internet providers are monopolizing the industry and colluding against the public, but this is simply not so. For 100\u2019s of years the Sherman Anti-Trust Law has been breaking up monopolies all across the country sticking to the issue that Milton Friedman gave in \u201cCapitalism and Freedom\u201d that generally monopolizes are bad, but that of a Public monopoly is worse. What this debate of net neutrality practically is misconcieved as is that the internet providers have that of a bottleneck like connection of the internet and can switch off connection and access to certain sites. Now here\u2019s the kicker, under the current laws under Section 2 of the Sherman Bill we can see that such a practice would be illegal. [4] So we can clearly see that we do not need more regulation. The FCC commissioner Robert McDowell backed this up by stating that, \u201cin the almost nine years since [net neutrality] fears were first sewn, net regulation lobbyists can point to fewer than a handful of cases of alleged misconduct, out of an infinite number of Internet communications. All those cases were resolved in favor of consumers under current law. \u201d [5] Sources (FCC, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan 19 (Mar. 16, 2010) [. http://www.broadband.gov...]) (. http://www.usnews.com...)

I will be defending my previous case to ensure a solid win.Solidifying Main Contention - Resource prioritization is just and non-discriminatoryThe idea of abandoning the concept of net neutrality is just under social terms. Google as well as Microsoft have taken measures in preventing the spread of abusive images such as child abuses(1). The action taken is morally and socially just in order to prevent paedophiles and rape from laying out their agendas. Without this firm action, abusive images would be just 1 click away in a search engine. Therefore, these actions are just. Resource prioritization should be given on other aspects, such as education, not one which serves as a detriment to society.Just for the sake of net neutrality, that factor alone will cause these things to happen and we have job as human beings to prevent that to ensure that our children will live a better life, free from harassment. This case alone, warrants that net neutrality be dropped regardless of the bullies made by the regulators.Tyler, the concept is justifiable even in discriminatory terms.You are essentially establishing correlation where none exist and at its best and worst, illogical. Like I said before, the complexity of technology allow nothing else except resource prioritization. This is just a matter of supplying each to its own needs. If we have extra incentives without even using them, what is the point of having it in the first place?Thus, the concept of egalitarianism is flawed. Consider this, Social Darwinism for example. It dictates survival of the fittest. This is highly evident in nature, but it cannot be applied to humans because we have a 'different way'. Likewise, the same can be said with technology. Your case is simply touching things in vacuum.Strengthening rebuttals - Concepts and actions are both inconclusiveTyler, you are proffering a case where regulators abused their privileges. As what was outlined above, the concept is justified irrespective of its peers. If its peers abused it, this is a matter of authority, not the concept itself.

One abusive act hardly represents anything. Which do you prefer? Abusive images of juveniles or a few mishandled actions?. No system is perfect.

Content: No one would propose that the U.S. Postal Service be prohibited from offering Express Mail because a \"fast lane\" mail service is \"unfair,\" \"undemocratic,\" or \"bad for the economy.\" Yet that's exactly what net neutrality would do for Internet services. In a free and open market, incentives exist to create premium services, with faster, guaranteed delivery quality, for things like medical monitoring which require higher reliability. Of course, suppliers could be expected to charge higher prices for these premium services. Such discrimination is procompetitive. Blocking premium services in the name of neutrality, on the other hand, can have the unintended consequence of blocking premium services from which consumers could benefit. The net neutrality debate turns on the distinction between procompetitive discrimination and anticompetitive discrimination. Net neutrality condemns both alike. Antitrust laws only condemn antitompetitive discrimination, so I for antitrust enforcement, which is more flexible, nuanced, and fact-based than a rigid net neutrality regime. It simply makes sense to allow a network to favor traffic from a patient's heart monitor over traffic delivering a music download. It also makes sense to allow network operators to restrict traffic that is downright harmful, such as viruses, worms, and spam. Antitrust laws allow these procompetitive benefits while also prohibiting anticompetitive discrimination. 1. An unregulated Internet is better than a regulated Internet. The Internet has always been a free and open market, shaped by intense competition and rampant growth. Costs and consumer demand interact to set price, entry costs are low, and entrepreneurs have the latitude to experiment with new and different business models. And as a free and open market, the Internet has thrived. In the absence of heavy government regulation, and \"due in large part to private investment and market-driven innovation, broadband in America has improved considerably in the last decade. More Americans are online at faster speeds than ever before.\" [1] Rigid net neutrality laws would change that. Instead of allowing the free market to guide investment dollars where needed, and allowing businesses to act based on the best use of scarce resources like bandwidth, the government would dictate many of these decisions, chilling competition, growth, and innovation. Historical data backs these claims up, showing that the less regulated broadband platform out-performs. Cable modem service, unburdened by \"open access\" mandates, spurted out to an early advantage. Then, when network sharing mandates on telephone networks were abruptly reduced, DSL surged. When DSL was regulated, network growth stagnated, but as soon as it was deregulated, DSL deployment took off. [2] Network sharing mandates were also imposed, and then eliminated, on fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology. Prior to the FCC's decision to eliminate fiber network \"open access\" rules,\" there was virtually no FTTH technology in the US. After deregulation, substantial investments were made, and now more than six million households subscribe to the Internet through ultra-fast fiber connections [3] 2. Net neutrality doesn't distinguish between procompetitive and anticompetitive practices. Entrepreneurs often experiment with new and different business models -- e.g. prioritize network traffic -- to lower prices and improve customer experience. For example, Lariat Wireless, a small ISP in Wyoming, forbids its customers from operating servers, to reduce network congestion and improve the overall experience for their users. Brett Glass, the CEO, explains: \"most Internet users would not know what a server was if it bit them, and they have no problem uploading content to a Web site such as YouTube for distribution. This means customers that do need to operate a server could obtain that capability by paying a bit more to cover the additional cost.\" Under a net neutrality regime, however, Lariat Wireless would be forced to shift \"everyone to the more expensive plan. We will therefore be less competitive, offer less value to consumers and especially less value to economically disadvantaged ones.\" [3] There are other examples. Universities that don't allow peer-to-peer file-sharing on their networks, for example. Or Virginia Broadband, which improves customer experience by prohibiting customers from \"excessive\" use of their network. Like Lariat Wireless, Virginia Broadband can offer quality Internet service at lower prices. The folks who benefit most are the \"economically disadvantaged,\" and those who use the Internet sparingly. [4] Unregulated markets give entrepreneurs the latitude to experiment as such, producing procompetitive outcomes: more options, lower prices, and better quality services. A net neutrality requirement is a bad policy because it categorically condemns all discriminatory practices, without distinguishing the procompetitive from the anticompetitive. 3. Current antitrust laws are enough to protect consumers and competition. Over more than 100 years, antitrust laws have developed to protect consumers from anticompetitive business practices -- monopolization, collusion, price-fixing, etc. The main development in the antitrust laws has been a movement away from categorical rules (stuff like \"all monopolies are bad\") towards a more nuanced case-by-case approach. Instead of condemning business practices per se, courts require proof of harm to consumers or competition first. This approach is more nuanced, fact-based, and flexible, as well as being better for the economy by giving entrepreneurs latitude to experiment. The net neutrality debate turns on the idea that there are bottlenecks on the Internet which allow network owners to exercise market power. For example, if a local telephone company has a monopoly in broadband access and it blocks broadband subscribers from using an Internet phone service offered by a rival company, that could harm both competition and consumers. But that's a classic antitrust issue. And under the antitrust laws, the above business practice would be illegal under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. You don't need further regulation to deal with anticompetitive discrimination on the Internet. Indeed, FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell notes that \"in the almost nine years since [net neutrality] fears were first sewn, net regulation lobbyists can point to fewer than a handful of cases of alleged misconduct, out of an infinite number of Internet communications. All those cases were resolved in favor of consumers under current law.\" [6] There is simply no reason to prefer displacing the antitrust laws -- flexible, nuanced, fact-based enforcement -- with a rigid net neutrality regime. -- Net neutrality goes directly against most American consumers' values, such as competition, freedom of choice, and less government regulation. Evidence shows that the Internet has been marked by intense competition and rampant growth as a free and open market with light regulation. Historical data also suggests regulations stunt growth. All these reasons support antitrust enforcement over net neutrality regulations.

I don\"t see any reason why it\"s suddenly become important, when the Internet has functioned quite well for the past 15 years without it ... Government attempts to regulate technology have been extraordinarily counterproductive in the past.\" [5] -- Pro says \"in many places you only have one [ISP] option.\" That's true, but the big companies aren't to blame. Local governments are the problem. \"Before building out new networks, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must negotiate with local governments for access to publicly owned 'rights of way' so they can place their wires above and below both public and private property. ISPs also need 'pole attachment' contracts with public utilities so they can rent space on utility poles for above-ground wires, or in ducts and conduits for wires laid underground.\" [6] The result: \"Local governments and their public utilities charge ISPs far more than these things actually cost.\" [6] ISPs try to enter new areas all the time. The problem is that entry costs -- not the laying wires part but the costs of negotiating with local governments -- are extremely high. That's something neither net neutrality nor antitrust laws will change. The irony of Pro's position is that it asks for MORE government regulation when government is ALREADY the biggest obstacle preventing competition among ISPs. The solution is getting local governments to allow the free market to do its thing. That's how you get more competition among ISPs, which in turn lowers prices. -- Pro claims that \"people do nothing because they are bought off\" and \"there are many loopholes.\" But that's also not true. Pro gives no source for his claims because the claims are bunk. ISPs aren't bribing anyone. I'm not even sure who they'd bribe, but note that the only way bribes work is under a regulatory scheme, which is what Pro supports. I'm the one arguing that we let the free market do its thing, which means bribes wouldn't help anyone. As for loopholes, again I have no idea what Pro's talking about. If by loopholes, Pro's referring to the antitrust laws, there aren't really any loopholes in the law. You either show harm to consumers or competition, or you don't show harm to consumers or competition. It's economics all the way down. If you show harm, it's illegal. That's how the laws work. So if an ISP has a monopoly on providing broadband, and it charges monopoly prices for \"fast-lanes,\" they'd be found liable and/or guilty under current antitrust laws. There's no need to build a rigid regulatory scheme on top of that. -- No one would propose that the U.S. Postal Service be prohibited from offering Express Mail because a \"fast lane\" mail service is \"unfair,\" \"undemocratic,\" or \"bad for the economy.\" Yet that's exactly what net neutrality would do for Internet services. In a free and open market, incentives exist to create premium services, with faster, guaranteed delivery quality, for things like medical monitoring which require higher reliability. Of course, suppliers could be expected to charge higher prices for these premium services. Such discrimination is procompetitive. Blocking premium services in the name of neutrality, on the other hand, can have the unintended consequence of blocking premium services from which consumers could benefit. ATT has even said that under a net neutrality regime, they'd have no incentive to invest in broadband infrastructure. The reality is that net neutrality chokes broadband competition, because it prevents experimentation in business models and pricing. We don't need net neutrality because the antitrust laws already protect consumers and competition from anticompetitive discrimination on the Internet. Broadband providers can't do anything that would hurt consumers or competition. If they do, it means they have monopoly power (because you can't impose monopoly prices without monopoly power, as consumers would just buy your service from your competitors). And if they have monopoly power and abuse that power (by extracting monopoly rents), they're already doing something illegal under current antitrust laws. Which is why FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai has said that the perceived threats from ISPs to deceive consumers, degrade content, or disfavor the content that they don\"t like are non-existent: \"The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it\"s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria. A small ISP in North Carolina allegedly blocked VoIP calls a decade ago. Comcast capped BitTorrent traffic to ease upload congestion eight years ago. Apple introduced Facetime over Wi-Fi first, cellular networks later. Examples this picayune and stale aren't enough to tell a coherent story about net neutrality. The bogeyman never had it so easy.\" [7] ISPs don't slow the Internet down in a free market; they compete with each other, which creates incentives to speed the Internet up. Net neutrality would choke that competition. [4] http://money.cnn.com... [5] http://www.nationalreview.com... [6] http://www.wired.com...

Are you saying the field should be tilted further in favor of established businesses in the interest of fairness by allowing an internet tax paid to the service providers? If that is your argument, then it essentially boils down to which side we compensate towards: the landed and established businesses, or the smaller, potentially successful startups. While one could make the argument that the former is \"fairer\", it is only so when regarding the present independently. Most large companies today had the benefit of being one of the first to corner a market. Simply by virtue of temporal advantage, and not necessarily by virtue of inherent product quality (though this is often the case as well), they were able to succeed.

With modern society becoming increasingly dependent on free and unfettered flow of information as the internet provides, Net Neutrality is becoming increasingly vital to future economic growth. Firstly, one of the most common arguments against Net Neutrality is that it is internet regulation, using the latter word as a pejorative. Free market economy, they say, mandates that ISPs may run their networks however they choose. However, they neglect the fact that the internet is a market itself, and ISPs act not so much as companies presiding over a resource as governments presiding over an economy. Just as the government needs restraint on its own economic control in order for its economy to grow, so the service providers need to exercise restraint in their control over the internet's tubes for it to grow. Secondly, let's look at what gives the internet such vast economic potential in the first place: it is this level playing field that has been maintained up to this point, giving McDonalds just as much potential for a great internet presence as the restaurant down the street. Of course this has been skewed by advertising and convention (people are more likely to go to places they've heard of, for example), but this will only be exacerbated to an extreme degree by the loss of net neutrality. Allowing the service provider arbitrary control over what gets to their end users will inevitably impose a huge burden on smaller website owners who cannot afford to front the cash that Google or Amazon can in order to get priority access to end users.

We are not debating net neutrality. Now I've already spent a bit of time defining the other major terms to give us a better ideal of what we're debating. According to Wikipedia; \"Net neutrality (also network neutrality, Internet neutrality, or net equality) is the principle that Internet service providers and governments should treat all data on the Internet equally, not discriminating or charging differentially by user, content, site, platform, application, type of attached equipment, or mode of communication.\" http://en.m.wikipedia.org... While a public utility is; \"Typically a public utility has a Monopoly on the service it provides. It is more economically efficient to have only one business provide the service because the infrastructure required to produce and deliver a product such as electricity or water is very expensive to build and maintain. A consequence of this monopoly is that federal, state, and local governments regulate public utilities to ensure that they provide a reasonable level of service at a fair price.\" http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com... This debate isn't about whether net neutrality is a good thing. The purpose of the debate is to determine whether or not provisions of Internet services (service providers), should be considered a public utility. As I've pointed out, they should be considered a utility, based on the fact that they meet the definition of utility, via the barrier to entry as well as the benefit to society for them to be regulated in that way. My opponent despite being off topic, has raised a few arguments which are vaguely relevant to the topic we are debating, and will be addressed accordingly. Now I urge my opponent to figure out a way to make some relevant arguments as well as rebuttals in the next round, if he doesn't he risks not being able to make any at all. The rules of the debate make it clear there are to be no new arguments in the final round. Contention 1: Unregulated Market is better than a Regulated market for the internet. My opponent makes kind of a false dichotomy, between a regulated and unregulated market. Before getting into specifics of what's wrong with his Arguments, let's examine more than just this dichotomy. There are many different types of regulated and unregulated markets. Some forms of regulated market work better than unregulated markets and visa versa. The real options we have when looking at these ISP/utilities is this: Unregulated Monopolized Markets- These markets are bad for consumers, but good for the companies. They get to dictate the prices, and the quality of service. This is the situation we have in America and as you can see it results in higher prices for consumers and bad service. I showed the lower broadband speeds as well as higher prices that these companies charge compared to overseas markets with either good regulation or a good amount of competition. (See round 2). http://www.theverge.com... 2. Unregulated Free Market Lots of Competition- This is an ideal scenario. Unfortunately as I've shown in the previous round. The market had been pretty deeply penetrated,the startup costs are immense and it takes a ton of time to see a profit. This is one of those businesses that are high risk, with low chance of reward. As somebody who is in love with free markets, I'd love to see perfect competition, but as I've shown in the previous round, that's not what is occurring, nor is it even possible to make it occur with a deregulation of the market, because of the costs associated with doing business and the deeply imbedded companies that are already there. 3. A Well Regulated Industry- there is no perfect solution to problems, but treating ISPs as the utilities they are, deals with the reality that a free market won't work in this specific scenario. It follows the example of other countries and utilities of times past, which have been shown to provide more reliable service at a cheaper price. Having some checks and balances to insure quality of service as well as value of service will help consumers immensely. Finally consumers will be on equal ground with ISPs. Finally America can have Internet service and strength that rivals that of third world countries. \"We can see that Entrapenuers have been free to do as they please and they have set reasonable prises and entry fees for the consumer.\" This is simply untrue and merely rhetoric from my opponent, taken from the word of some industry insider, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. I said it in the last round and I'll say it again. Out of 40 countries, the United States has been shown to have the slowest internet speeds and often for double the price. http://www.theverge.com... What the free market has gotten us is spit on by these companies. Comcast is the most hated company in the United States and yet people are still forced to pay for an inferior service at double the rate of their brethren in the UK. When my opponent puts a positive spin on Internet service by saying that it's improved a lot in the last ten years, he is merely putting on rose colored goggles. Who cares how much it improved? It's not keeping up with it's rivals in more regulated markets overseas and it's merely because they don't have to care. \"it\"s for this reason alone that the US has the fastest internet in the world, but Net Neutrality is threatening to change all of that.\" This is clearly false. I've cited sources that show the United States has slower internet speeds than the much of the rest of the world, and at more of a cost to boot. This debate isn't about net neutrality, but I can tell you we've seen the bill passed in the United States and I've yet to see my service change at all. \"FiberBroadband Community, an internet provided in the Great Lakes region reported that under net neutrality that they would be forced to move ALL of their customers to a more expensive plan and this would hurt the business as it would cost them more\" My only response to this is \"yeah duh\". The company is looking out for it's best interest. They make out better when they're unregulated. The consumers aren't necessarily better off not the industry, but they are. A company merely stating it will cost extra without showing why is just throwing hail Marie's to stop a bill they no will cut into their pocket books, but ultimately be better for the people. The company's claim should be ignored, unless they find some way to substantiate it. Status Quo Antitrust Lawsuit The antitrust laws simply aren't working. Comcast in particular has no real competition. The FCC is powerless. I've already shown several stats that prove that a monopoly exists in terms of ISPs in several locations effecting over 70% of the United States, but it's worse than that and I'll let the FCC chairman tell you in his own words. \"competition for high-speed wired broadband is lacking and Americans need more competitive choices for faster and better Internet connections, both to take advantage of today's new services, and to incentivize the development of tomorrow's innovations.\".....\"At 25 Mbps, there is simply no competitive choice for most Americans,\"....\"Stop and let that sink in.

In a Forbes article titled \"Net Neutrality Is a Bad Idea Supported by Poor Analogies,\" Jeffrey Dorfman writes \"[Net neutrality] is a bad idea for the same reason that only having vanilla ice cream for sale is a bad idea: some people want, and are willing to pay for, something different.\" That would be a rich analogy, right? Response: Broadband service is not ice cream and, categorically, it comes in one flavor anyway. What varies is its quantity. Conservatives who trumpet the anti-regulation cause have no ground to stand on. They do not argue for anti-regulation, they hope to take the power of regulation from the government and give it to the private corporations.", "qid": 46, "docid": "92c80a0a-2019-04-19T12:47:33Z-00012-000", "score": 7.880000114440918}, {"content": "Title: Net Neutrality Content: I believe that Net Neutrality is important for the internet because it makes sure that the internet stays a free market.

Let them. If they anger their customers, then a new generation of ISP companies will rise to replace them, just as the VOIP telephone companies have appeared to challenge traditional telephony. Returning to the issue of freedom of speech and net neutrality: Free speech is the first defined and protected right in the United States. It has succeeded in protecting all forms of speech, including political and social, for centuries. It is fully intact. Regulations on media do not limit free speech, they limit corporate activities. And skewed news reporting is a business decision. If you think Fox News is shallow or biased, watch BBC. We have a news marketplace. I have a dozen news channels standard in my TV package. They are all skewed to reflect the policies of the corporations that run them. You stated initially that net neutrality was about the freedom to access all web sites at the same speed. But web access is already limited by the user's computer, OS, browser, and ISP, as well as the web site's design, plugins, and servers. All of these elements are corporate products and are tweaked to perform in certain ways beyond your control. You then claimed that the internet represents free speech because the traditional media, as I described above, is biased by corporate interests. However, the internet is biased by personal interests. Blogs don't represent some higher truth, they represent the opinion of one person, who is probably not a well-informed expert. The article on Wikipedia on \"cardiology\" may have been written by an angry teenager and not a team of eminent cardiologists. Also, most blogs have tiny readerships. They are little more than personal journals sharing personal opinions with a small number of like-minded friends. This does not spread ideas or information. In fact, as demonstrated by my Wikipedia example, the \"information\" on the internet is largely untrustworthy, and untrustworthy information is completely worthless. Conclusions: (1) My opponent's claim that throttling schemes or other attempts to alter internet access threatens net neutrality is False because there is no such thing as net neutrality. The internet is already governed by and predicated upon corporate interests. (2) My opponent's claim that the internet represents the \"last vessel of free speech\" is False for two reasons: (a) The internet already is just as biased as traditional forms of media, and (b) the right to free speech as strong today as when it was drafted in the Bill of Rights. It is false to equate corporate access to information with the freedom of expression.", "qid": 46, "docid": "f4864a7e-2019-04-18T19:41:08Z-00000-000", "score": 7.749300003051758}, {"content": "Title: Net neutrality will force ISPs to ask permission from FCC.

I'm just gonna refute what you said in each paragraph separately. Paragraph #1: So you used an example of, \"paying more for water.\" But here is the thing. It really isn't that. A common misconception is that the price of basic internet will be raised. No. Everyone will have internet at the same price as it was during Net Neutrality, but you can pay for faster internet if you want it, similar to if you want to upgrade your hotel room. You can upgrade if you have the money, but if you don't have the money, it doesn't mean that you don't have a good hotel room. You still do! So it beneficial to people who have a few extra dollars. Paragraph #2: So you said that it would be hard to make businesses it completely backwards. As I said in my second point, \"Net Neutrality is a Red Herring that Hurts Innovation,\" FCC plan (pg 249.): businesses need legal/financial freedom in order to spur innovation and creativity. By encouraging network investment, consumers benefit. According to Economic Analyst Ainsley Miller, \"a world w/out NN would actually provide better service b/c companies would have more leeway to create faster content for everyone.\" Paragraph #3 and 4: You were talking about a violation of free speech, but according to Fox News: no internet provider wants to be known for \"slow service,\" or being, \"anti-free speech,\" so the consumer has nothing 2 worry about. So, here is what I just said hopefully simplified. If the Internet Service Provider slows down certain websites, the ISPs will actually lose money because they don't want to be thought of as 'anti-free speech.' And if they are, then people will move to a new ISP. So it is actually in the best interest of the ISPs to not slow down content. Instead, they can slow down bad things, like scams, hackers, and things that people don't want to see online. They won't push their personal agenda because then they will lose money, something that they don't want to do.

Again, I stand in firm affirmation of the above resolution that states The United States should normalize its relations with Cuba. I would first like to challenge my opponent's definition of normalize. According to Merriam-Webster's dictionary the word normalized is defined as the following. \"to bring or restore (as relations between countries) to a normal condition.\" http://www.merriam-webster.com... I would also like to challenge his offered definition of natural. I will define it again by the same Merriam-Webster's dictionary \"having an essential relation with someone or something : following from the nature of the one in question Using this definition I believe that our relationship with Cuba is neither natural nor normal. Our former president added Cuba to list of \"The axis of evil\" in 2002. (news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1971852.stm) First of all I find it inherently impossible to have a relationship with a group of people whom you find evil. My opponent went into a long, drawn-out, and entirely irrelevant lecture on past relations with Cuba, which has no bearing on his own resolution. I would like to define \"should\" as my opponent failed to do so. According to Merriam Webster's dictionary should is defined as the following: \u2014used in auxiliary function to express obligation, propriety, or expediency <'tis commanded I should do so. Should in the above example expresses the fact that \"should\" and \"ought to\" are interchangeable\" and ought to expresses the future and not the past. So, by saying I affirm that the US SHOULD normalize its relations with Cuba, the negation's case SHOULD be the opposite. In public forum debate, according to Black's law the negative cannot argue the neutral, because the resolution suggests that the US-Cuban relationship is not normal. Since his position is neutral he is not really debating. I will now prove how our relationship with Cuba is not \"normal\" and needs to be \"normalized\" As I said in my previous argument, in order for any political relationship to be \"normal\" is must be A) workable B) we must establish a neutral relationship with Cuba and therefore we should remove them from the proverbial \"axis of evil\" C) We must, remain neutral in their affairs, unless they directly affect the US itself or any of its allies.

This debate is not about net neutrality and whether it should be tossed aside or used is beside the point. Somebody could be pro net neutrality and against considering the Internet a utility or somebody can be for considering the Internet a utility and against net neutrality. My opponent has dropped several of my arguments. My opponent has dropped the argument that the cost of infrastructure and entry is so much that it takes a significant amount of control over local markets for a start up to succeed, and since they're the new guy in town it's extremely hard to gain the 30% of the market they need. Broadband companies such as Comcast, have huge natural monopolies, and in a world that requires such a big infrastructure and market penetration to succeed, it's virtually impossible to have a competitive industry. He has dropped my arguments showing that currently the Internet companies have virtual monopolies over local markets. These facts automatically get accepted into any judges calculations as it's too late to bring up new arguments against them as per WODC rules, as well as just a general principle of fairness. LANNAN IS CONFUSED AGAIN My opponent's rebuttal round is spent using arguments against the nationalization of the Internet industry. Let me define nationalization for those who may not be aware of what that is; \"Nationalization (American English), (British and Commonwealth spelling nationalisation) is the process of taking a private industry or private assets into public ownership by a national government or state. \" . http://en.m.wikipedia.org... This debate is not about taking private assets and turning them into government property. The debate is merely about recognizing that the companies who provide Internet services have too much control over the industry. When a company has too much control over an industry, it's competition is no longer able to act as a check against the company acting against the best interest of the consumer. The regulation that comes with recognizing that Internet services are a public utility, are there to insure a balance between making a profit and treating customers fairly. This type of regulation actually allows a company to keep their monopolies because it understands that these types of services require massive infrastructure. Just like electric companies and consumers would be worse off with more competition in broadband, because it would create an alarming amount of overlapping infrastructures, however that is kinda beside the point. The massive infrastructure actually helps create a natural monopoly as I have argued and my opponent has not contested the natural monopoly exists. Con mentions how theoretically price controls can be too high or too low and harm industry. While I concede that it is possible for the government to charge outrages prices for goods and drive consumers away or charge too little and destroy a company, it is unlikely. Phone service, electricity, and water services have been regulated as utilities for as long as me and my opponent have been alive and my guess is we both have electricity and running water, which is believe it or not, quite affordable. While the landline telephone industry going the way of the dinosaur, when it was a necessity, government regulating it as a utility kept the prices low enough for one to be in virtually every home while the companies providing the services actually made plenty of profits the entire time they were regulated. The regulations, neither harmed consumers or the companies, it merely balanced out the disadvantages of having a monopolized industry, and it should be noted that competition in these specific industries isn't necessarily a good thing either as the massive infrastructures are overlapping and waste a lot of resources. It's one of those situations where people are better off with a regulated monopoly than many competing companies. My opponent moves Onto discussing Kant and what's known as the categorical imperative, but greatly misunderstands the categorical imperative, as well as gives us no reason to favor that moral system, over the normative system we already use. Seeing as how the normative system is the one we already use and We were given no reason to assume Kantian ethics, I say we use normative ethics. The first problem with applying Kantian ethics in this situation is that Kant was describing a system of personal ethics for people to apply, and my opponent is trying to imply personal ethics to the state without explaining why personal ethics are even applicable to a non living entity. According to Kant perfect duties are to be performed all the time, where as imperfect duties were to be performed in some circumstances. Things that are imperfect duties aren't things the state should refrain from as my opponent assumes. If we're applying the categorical imperative to the state, imperfect duties should be done sometimes, meaning that sometimes it is correct to treat a utility as a utility. I've explained why we should do so in this debate. If it is an imperfect duty, it is still one that should be performed based on the reasoning I gave. . http://plato.stanford.edu... Regulated vs Unregulated \"My opponent harps on the US having such a terrible internet speed and quality, but they are sadly mistaken. We can see that we are actually 10th in the World for the fastest speed and best internet quality. We are definately not the 40th slot that my opponent mistakably claims. \" Um I linked to a study showing that America is 40th among countries and territories looked at. I actually went through the trouble of quoting stats and quotes from an article on the study, where as my opponent merely says I'm mistaken without pointing out which of the statistics I quoted is wrong or why. I read the article my opponent links to in the comment section. Out of a list of 10 countries we see that the United States is 10th. We have no many ideals how many countries that study looked at or it's method collections. So one list shows the United States in last place of 10 areas and the other shows it as last place of 40 countries. Come on Lannan, last place is last place. Clearly not all countries and areas are included in my list of 40. My list obviously excluded third world nations and the Gal\"pagos Islands. There is no need to split hairs here. The point is that the United States could and should do better. A point which my opponent doesn't counter at all. \"We can see that this is a HUGE concession as my opponent here concedes that under the status quo that the free market is better as \"They make out better when they're unregulated\"\" My statement was that the monopolies do better when they are left unregulated, not that the economy or customers do better. Clearly, my argument is that these companies have too much leverage over consumers and despite the fact that Comcast does better when they don't have as many rules to follow, the average American does worse. My opponent ends that round with a baffling remark about nationalization, which isn't even something we're debating. Status quo and Anti Trust \"We can see here by what my opponent decided to point out is that once again we need free market competition over that of the Public Nationalization of this industry as it helps the industry. \" The quote by the FCC chairman is meant to point out the lack of competition in the Internet industry. The quote is by another person. The chairman may be knowledgable about the problems facing the industry, but I disagree with his conclusions on the solution. He sees the problem is not enough competition and jumps to the most obvious conclusion, however the most obvious solution isn't feasible in this situation as I've shown the industry to be too hard to break into. \"My opponent has dropped the entire argument that I've made here and we can see that the current Sharman Bill has done it's job. \" I haven't dropped any arguments. The current bill you bring up has done absolutely nothing to prevent these industries from monopolizing (and we haven't even concluded that monopolizing a utility is bad, only that a monopolized utility should be regulated as one. ). I've shown that the current attempts at preventing monopolies has failed in this circumstance, that the industry naturally monopolizes as it needs deep market penetration to be profitable and that the status quo isn't working and we need provisions of Internet services to be recognized as a utility. Conclusion My opponent hasn't even argued against the resolution and instead has argued against nationalization and argued against net neutrality. He has dropped most of my arguments and has baffled me with his interpretations of my arguments. I urge my opponent to read over my arguments several times to comprehend them properly. I also urge him to just forfeit the debate and save the judges the trouble of having to read through all this and analyze it as a formality.", "qid": 46, "docid": "32192392-2019-04-18T14:44:58Z-00001-000", "score": 7.189300060272217}]}, {"query": "Is homework beneficial?", "hits": [{"content": "Title: Homework Should Not Be Required Content: Thanks Danielle! This debate has definitely been a fun one to participate in. [Debate Summary] Clarification It is evident that my opponent completely misunderstands what a counterplan is. My counterplan (ie. proposed changes to the status quo which gives me a fraction of the BOP) was in regards to quantity because, obviously, I can feasibly make sure that all homework is beneficial and of a good quality - that does NOT mean that I can\u2019t talk about homework quality within the status quo and in the past because my counterplan is not a list of my advocacies (as my opponent seems to believe). Ergo, there is no contradiction, I hope it is now clear to my opponent and to voters of what a counterplan is and how it is different to my advocacies and rebuttals. So, just to clarify, my counterplan states that quantity is too high so it will be reduced. My rebuttal to my opponent\u2019s source is that it addresses an older version of the education system with different qualities of homework. These statements are not contradictory and can coexist without any contradictions. Nobody should be confused by this. I extend those arguments. Point 1 The outcome of this contention is simple. My opponent uses incredibly unreliable data that fails to account for 99.99999163742% of the children in the world (children in poverty and in poor conditions are still children and should be [and are] included in this figure). Virtually all of my opponent\u2019s sources here deal with large quantities of homework which is something that I\u2019m specifically advocating the removal of from the status quo (as is made evident in my counterplan). My opponent has attempted to show that my sources do not account for as many people as hers however my sources are not being used in the same way that hers are. She is using her sources to prove that homework should be abolished using statistical data. I was using mine for general claims that bare the same weight regardless of the amount of people involved since I did not use these for statistic related claims. She also appears to believe that not every beneficial thing must be mandatory. I have accepted this however my opponent seems to believe that this is as far as her burden requires her to achieve. This is objectively false. There are some things that are beneficial and should be mandatory (my opponent concedes this). Therefore, my opponent\u2019s burden entails them in proving that whilst homework can be beneficial it should not be mandatory. My concession of beneficial things not having to be mandatory does not mean that my opponent\u2019s burden is advanced in any way. Counterplan 1A. My opponent once again misunderstands what a counterplan is. My opponent lies about me saying that my counterplan involves only beneficial homework being implemented. She tries to get out of this precarious situation she\u2019s been put in by saying that by saying this it means that I advocate all homework - even non beneficial homework. This is simply not true. A counterplan is a proposed change to the status quo on the the negative case\u2019s behalf. I cannot make a beneficial related change to the status quo because as my opponent pointed out earlier on in this debate, that simply isn\u2019t feasible. This doesn\u2019t mean that I wouldn\u2019t prefer there to be only beneficial homework, I would. Though this is virtually impossible so I am focussing my counterplan elsewhere. 1B. My opponent makes an identical misinterpretation to what she says in response to point 1A. Just because I\u2019m not making a proposed change on the status quo to make all homework beneficial, doesn\u2019t mean that I do not advocate this - I merely find this proposed changed to be unfeasible and unrealistic. Please extend my counterplan as my opponent pretty much drops it all and instead resorts to refuting nonexistent argument regarding benefits and then making strange and ultimately false complaints about me advocating homework that isn\u2019t beneficial. Point 2 In this contention I proved that the burden on parents is of an extremely low percentage. The majority are clearly content with the status quo. Regardless, even if this objection fails you still ought to presume Con as the counterplan minimizes homework quantity for those that receive too much homework, therefore the burden on parents is virtually non existent. Either way, you ought to consider this point in my favor. She also raised the objection of family time being lost which was also refuted by the fact that I used psychological evidence in order to refute this point and show that in reality family time is created as opposed to being lost. I also showed that students are set based on abilities and are given the amount of homework that should be sufficient in correlation with their ability so that everybody spends the same amount of time on homework (though not necessarily doing the same amount of homework or the same difficulty level in homework). Furthermore, I managed to show that parents doing homework is neither good nor bad. Though no benefits at all is worse. Sets and teaching opinion on students is formulated based on class work and examination (which I proved via citation in the previous round). Therefore, whilst this does happen, all this means is that some students won\u2019t gain anything from homework and some will. I refuted the objection in regards to resources due to the fact that schools take the student\u2019s parents/carers financial state into consideration. My opponent blatantly lies when she says: \u201cCon dropped that even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical. \u201d This is massively untrue. I will quote my response from R3: \u201cShe helps explain the very purpose of homework itself. She points out that homework cannot be monitored in regards to approach and therefore students may not grasp or understand the material properly. If they do not understand it and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them. The lesson is designed to teach all students generally. The homework shows specific pupils progress and understanding of that lesson which teachers can then monitor and intervene if necessary in order to help said student to understand it properly\u201d. My opponent\u2019s claim that I dropped this is ludicrous. Point 3 My opponent claims that homework cuts time into things and she also claim that it provides a second shift of work for children. This is automatically negated by the counterplan. Additionally, even if my counterplan was not enacted this contention would still work in my favor since after school activities exist and I presented a large statistic showing that people have plenty of time to do homework alongside activities and I demonstrated that there are a record breaking amount of people in part time jobs in the UK which my opponent drops. Point 4 I have shown that homework does not count towards sets for children. In fact class work and examination are used only. The only claims that my opponent has been able to muster are bare assertions that homework is often graded (which is irrelevant since grading homework is not the same as taking it into consideration when assessing that student\u2019s ability - which is what general classwork and examinations are for). I concede that cheating happens however my opponent\u2019s website regarding cheating statistics is unreliable (and my opponent drops this argument). We can conclude that since homework does not count for anything important, cheating has no effects (neither positive or negative). Whereas the students that opt in to do their homework properly receive the benefits from homework which my opponent concedes when she says that just because homework is beneficial, doesn\u2019t mean that it should be mandatory. Once again, my opponent lies and states that I dropped the effects of HW\u2019s drill and kill methodology. This is false. Again, I will have to quote my response which my opponent supposedly claims is nonexistent when she says that I dropped it: \u201cAgain, the review my opponent cites in an attempt to prove that homework results in the loss of sleep, self esteem and childhood is refuted by the counterplan as it once again references to excessive homework and homework taking up valuable time from children. \u201d The outcome of this debate is incredibly clear. The resolution is negated.", "qid": 47, "docid": "ae7c3aca-2019-04-18T13:14:06Z-00000-000", "score": 8.081399917602539}, {"content": "Title: Homework Should Not Be Required Content: Keep in mind I cannot respond to any of Con's dropped contentions.Point 1My opponent seemingly defeats his own argument. In the last round he said exactly this: \"Here is a remind of my counter plan: Homework should be given in moderate quantity (in short).This is about homework QUANTITY (ie. how much homework is given) NOT homework QUALITY (ie. how beneficial it is).\"And yet when explaining why my sources are allegedly irrelevant, he says:\"She falsely states that I must prove that homework assigned then vs. now is different in quantity... All I need to do is show that the systems of education have changed since then because that affects everything. If homework is different in regards to difficulty (for example), then higher quantity is not as necessary if it\u2019s harder.\" In the first statement he says that he is arguing QUANTITY is what matters in assessing homework. And then in the second statement he says DIFFICULTY is what's relevant and quantity isn't relevant at all. I'm sure I am not the only one confused by Con's statements, and once again, I will not have the opportunity to respond.To repeat my position, students have had roughly the same amount of HW quantity over the last 30 years. Con does not deny this - nor has Con proven that a DIFFERENCE in education standards over the last 30 years means a difference one way or the other (easier or harder) let alone a difference in the quality of HW assignments. Moreover, I argued that Con had not proven that his studies account for more of the population than the ones I have presented. If he cannot, then we have no reason whatsoever to believe that the pro-HW studies he cites (noting that quantity of homework is most important -- which I've argued against) are any more valid. He dropped this contention and has not proven that his studies represent a larger sample size.I pointed out that my study examined data of more than 18,000 students to uncover explanations for academic performance. Con suggests we have to use the entire world population of children as a measure which is absurd. Out of 1.9 billion children, 1 billion of them live in destitute poverty [1]. These children, especially in the third world, can't even eat or drink and millions die from starvation daily -- yet Con suggests we should factor them into the population of students who benefit from homework, when they have never seen a school in their life. That is an abusive standard no judge would take seriously. Quite obviously we are discussing homework in the West (especially the U.S.) where public education and the subsequent standards is the norm. Thus 18K is a good sample size for research. Con has not even tried to present us with an estimate of the number of students his cited studies cover, let alone present research that accounts for a larger size. Some studies in his favor have \"hundreds\" yet I invite Con to prove his studies are more relevant in size, date and scope [2, 3]. One study in his favor had a sample size of around 1,300 students -- or about 1/18th of the population my sources covered. In short, Con has dug himself a hole in trying to attack the credibility of my sources and studies; he has not proven his are any more valid. In the last round I decided to move on from this and noted it would appear SOME cases show that homework could be beneficial (accounting for a lot of different variables). Of course, that is completely irrelevant to the rest of my argument. I've pointed out that not everything that is beneficial ought to be required as well as suggested the potential negatives of HW outweigh the potential positives. Indeed that is the crux of my position in this debate. 1A. I pointed out that even if HW can sometimes be beneficial, Con is only saying that *beneficial* homework be required - not all homework. Yet he cannot ensure the HW assigned will be beneficial. He responded with accusations of straw mans when in fact he fails to see the absurdity of this objection. If Con is not saying that only BENEFICIAL homework be required, then he is advocating that even NON-beneficial homework be required. Why would Con advocate non-beneficial homework?! That would be punishment with no substance or positive effect. Therefore it is only logical to assume Con is only advocating BENEFICIAL homework. If he would like to challenge this, I guess he can...1B. It would appear Con does want to challenge this lol. He writes, \"Again, this seems to be a misinterpretation of the counter plan. I never mentioned that it had to be beneficial, nor did I say that beneficial things have to be mandatory.\" So here we can see that Con even supports HW that is not beneficial, meaning he has no good reason (positive benefits) to support HW at all. And furthermore, Con skirts 1B as if it is a meaningless statement when in fact it is the entire basis of my argument. Please extend all of my 1B points -- I pointed out why not all things that are beneficial should be required. Ergo, even if homework were beneficial, it need not be mandatory. Con thinks HW (despite being so problematic) should just be imposed whether it has benefits or not, which is an even more ridiculous position than I think anyone expected him to take. Point 2Con accuses me of not refuting the counter plan which is false. His counter plan is simply \"less homework\" which I have argued, especially in Point 2. \"Con argues that by reducing HW time, the problems of HW won't exist. But while they might be less significant, they would still exist. Even 1 hour of HW per night interferes with 1 hour of family or recreational time. Furthermore, Con cannot prove that all students spend the same amount of time on homework...\" which proves I did address his counter plan of less HW time. My opponent says that it's okay for students to spend different amounts of time on HW, which fails to address my point on an undue burden for slow learners or those who take longer to do assignments. This means additional stress and imposition for those students on recreational and rest time, which Con glosses over as being addressed by special classes/assignments but this cannot be proven or enforced. Even students in special classes learn at a different pace from each other. Con asked for sources proving that parents do their kid's homework. I presented the studies; Con dropped this point and said \"Well kids should be doing it themselves.\" Sure, but extend my argument that they are often NOT doing it themselves based on my statistics. Con must concede this point; instead he suggests this simply doesn't matter. Obviously when parents do their kid's assignments, it places burden on the parents and provides no utility to the child while still creating work for teachers. Once again - whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to HW monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy HW response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Many students (especially in low-income areas) specifically have a hard time completing their assignments.In response, Con says \"since there will be a lower homework quantity, this means that these people will not be overwhelmed with homework\" which clearly doesn't address my points at all regarding lack of resources, not just time. Con also says that the states account for financial factors in HW assignments and cited this source from the UK -- yet not a single line from that source said anything about poverty affecting assigned work or HW. I invite my opponent to copy and paste the line from that source which proves his point here [4]. I have no reason to accept it thus far. And besides, people within the same school can still come from vastly different financial backgrounds. Con states, \"If [students] do not understand [HW] and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them.\" However teachers do not give students more help if they have trouble with homework - a factor cited in Con's previous source from the CPE [5]. Con dropped that even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical. However teachers cannot monitor or control how students approach their HW. Con also dropped that his citations don't account for today's HW distractions. Research shows that students today are not grasping as much of the homework material even when they complete it, because they are distracted by social media and don't retain the information.Point 3Con says \"She makes a an argument riddled with fallacies. She claims that homework cuts into time for anything.\" That is not fallacious but a logical fact. If you spend time on X (homework) you cannot spend time on Y (anything else) that requires significant attention. That's called the law of non-contradiction. Just because school provides some activities doesn't mean it provides the same activities or amount of time/attention on those activities as parents or kids would like. Con notes that school, work, etc. cut into people's time and yet I am not advocating those be abolished. I explained how homework provides a \"second shift\" of work that kids should not have to face. Please extend my arguments on parents not being subjected to this burden and having options here; Con dropped it and I will not be able to respond.Point 4Con says that HW \"counts for nothing\" yet HW is often graded. Con says I have provided \"no evidence\" of cheating. See explanations regarding points 12-15 in the last round. He only contested 1 of those sources. One is a forum - the rest are academic - and he ignores that parents doing HW is cheating which he admits happens. He dropped every one of my arguments on copying and using the internet to cheat as well. Con also dropped the negative effects of HW's \"drill and kill\" methodolgy and its impact on learning.

Firstly, homework is beneficial to children in schools, as long as it is in moderate amounts. I, as team opposition, understand that in large amounts, homework can overload the child and can be very stressful. But when moderated, homework can be extremely beneficial. The most common benefit of homework is the obvious, improvement in academics. \"Researchers who looked at data from more than 18,000 10th-graders found there was little correlation between the time students spent doing homework and better grades in math and science courses. But, according to a study on the research, they did find a positive relationship between standardized test performance and the amount of time spent on homework.\" This source obviously shows the correlations found in tests. However, doing homework has a lot of less-know benefits for children \"Pryor-Johnson identifies four qualities children develop when they complete homework that can help them become high-achieving students: responsibility; time management; perseverance; and self-esteem. While these cannot be measured on standardized tests, perseverance has garnered a lot of attention as an essential skill for successful students. Regular accomplishments like finishing homework build self-esteem, which aids students\" mental and physical health. Responsibility and time management are highly desirable qualities that benefit students long after they graduate.\" My source clearly demonstrates my point. Whilst the general public may not know these benefits, they are there, improving the child's work across the board. So, as you can clearly see from these arguments, and the sources I have provided, homework should not be abolished because it is beneficial to the children who do them.

In fact data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) provides a good look at trends in homework (HW) for the past three decades, and concludes that today's students have had about the same amount of HW over the last 30 years [1]. This means all of my studies are relevant. I presented studies that collected data from more than 10,000 students nationwide between 1990 and 2002 [2]. The TIMSS report is from 2007 and covers 59 different countries [3]. Is research from the last 8-20 years really that off base? Con would have to prove that the amount of homework assigned then vs. now is drastic enough to make a difference, but he won't be able to.Con states that my research only includes a small portion of the population, and therefore this research is not valid. However this negates the very own research he presents. First, almost all of the \"pro homework\" studies cited by the CPE is research from the 1950s to 1990s, making Con's claim about my allegedly outdated research null and void. Second, Con does not prove that those studies account for more of the population than the ones I have presented. If he cannot, then we have no reason to believe that the pro-HW studies are any more valid. Con's very own source: \"Information from international assessments shows little relationship between the amount of homework students do and test scores.\"\"Kohn says... there is no conclusive evidence that homework provides any benefits\u2014either academic or nonacademic\u2014to students.\" \"Homework also has potentially negative associations, one involving students' economic status.\"\"Teachers do not give students more help if they have trouble with homework.\"\"Lower-achieving students may take more time than higher-achieving students to finish assignments\" [3]. Indeed it would appear there is conflicting information, and there are some cases where homework could be beneficial. [ Re: Counterplan ]1A. Even if we accept HW can sometimes be beneficial, Con is only saying that *beneficial* homework be required - not all homework. Yet he cannot ensure the HW assigned will, in fact, be beneficial. 1B. Just because something is beneficial does not mean it ought to be required. Exercise, a healthy diet and a good amount of sleep are all beneficial to one's health and even education, as those factors affect one's academic performance [4, 5]. Schools can encourage these things in their facility, however in the home they rely on parents to do what's best for their children. As I mentioned in the last round, parents should determine or influence the way their kids learn or reinforce information in the home. If they want their kid to do homework, they can assign it or seek additional resources. In his Point 4 rebuttal, Con claims that HW is simply defined as \u201cschoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home\" and my suggestion that it can sometimes be beneficial works as a concession. It does not. First, homework is uniform and I specifically advocated an assortment of assignments TBD by teachers, students and parents - not uniform HW. Second, Con must prove that homework ought to be required - that is mandated by the school/state. Again just because something is beneficial does not mean it should be required. Homework can be suggested, encouraged or even assigned, but not necessarily mandatory.Point 2My opponent claims that he \"doesn't understand\" how the backlash from parents over homework proves that homework is a burden on parents. It's self-evident. Parents complaining about the burden (to the point of going to court) proves it is in fact a burden. He then goes on to say that some parents don't mind homework, and claims he can cite court cases where parents have gone to court asking for homework and won. I would like my opponent to prove that he can cite court cases where parents have asked for more homework and won. He won't be able to, but even if he did, all this proves is that the parents who want homework should be able to give their kids homework, whereas those who don't shouldn't have to. Many parents secure tutors or prep classes for subjects and tests their kids need help with. This can replace homework for the parents who believe it is helpful, without placing an undue burden on teachers and other classmates/parents who feel otherwise. Con argues that by reducing HW time, the problems of HW won't exist. But while they might be less significant, they would still exist. Even 1 hour of HW per night interferes with 1 hour of family or recreational time. Furthermore, Con cannot prove that all students spend the same amount of time on homework, and in fact this was one of my contentions in the last round that Con dropped. We don't assign slower students longer school days, but we assign them longer homework days. Kids who struggle with their HW would spend a lot longer on their tasks than those who do not, meaning required HW is still problematic.Con requests sources proving that parents do homework: A survey from 2008 shows that 43% of parents have done their kid's homework [6]. It's nearly 80% of black and Hispanic parents who do their kid's HW one day per week, and more than 40% of them do it THREE or more times a week out of likely four assigned HW days [7]. It is around 36% for white students. This cheating does not foster independence, responsibility or honesty, nor does it provide any of the alleged benefits of homework to these students. My opponent has dropped my contention that each child has a different home environment. Whereas some parents have the time and resources to dedicate to homework monitoring and assistance, other parents do not have the opportunity to be as involved. Thus a shoddy HW response might reflect poorly on the child unfairly. Many students (especially in low-income areas) specifically have a hard time completing their assignments. They cannot focus in their environments [8] which Con's own CPE source reiterates. Even when good HW is assigned, it is the student's approach that is critical. However teachers cannot monitor or control how students approach their HW. My opponent claims that my research on the utility of homework is outdated (I've argued that his is outdated) and yet I also don't believe his citations account for today's HW distractions. Research shows that students today are not grasping as much of the homework material even when they complete it, because they are distracted by social media and don't retain the information [8].Con argues it doesn't matter that teachers waste time grading homework because they know it is a condition of the job. That's fallacious circular reasoning. Just because something is a condition doesn't mean it ought to be a condition, which is exactly what I'm arguing (that it shouldn't be). I explained that teachers can use the time they spend grading homework to improve their own education (research, school or reading) or plan new and innovative lessons that provide more learning utility than homework. Point 3Con states that I have made the \"unsourced\" claim that by spending time on homework, kids are missing out on time spent on other things. Quite frankly it's ridiculous to ask for a citation on this self-evident fact. If someone spends time on X, they cannot spend time on Y. I'm not sure how that can be any more clear, but hopefully these sources will satiate Con's request [9, 10]. Here is another source claiming homework inhibits rest [11]. My opponent does not deny the utility of things like athletics, the arts, etc. but rather says they are provided in school (irrelevant) and that students already participate in after-school activities. But regardless of the amount of homework assigned, the time spent on HW interferes with other things whether it is rest, relaxation or other hobbies. Further, consider the fact that many older students work (or want to work) but can't as they must complete their \"second shift\" of homework after school. Most adults are not forced to complete work at home after their work day. Even if they were, adults have the option of getting a different job. Con advocates less HW but cannot ensure that less HW (and meaningful work) will actually be provided by the teachers that students cannot opt out of. Point 4Con writes, \"Voters should NOT buy my opponent\u2019s claim that it encourages cheating and creates a gap between the intelligent and academically struggling because this is once again bare assertion on my opponent\u2019s behalf.\" 1 - Parents often do their kids homework (which is cheating).2 - Students cheat because they fear penalty of not completing their assignments from teachers and parents.3 - Grades, rather than education, have become the major focus of many students [12]. Computers can make cheating easier than ever before, and kids have unmonitored (and often unlimited) access to computers in the home. Students can download term papers from the world wide web. They can also take pictures of math calculations that not only provide the answer, but how they got the answer so the student is able to regurgitate it without any effort or learning on their part. Studies show cheating is more common than ever before [13, 14] which is obviously most problematic in the home. Research shows the lowest amount of students admitting to cheating on written assignments is 84 percent, and some data shows it as high as 95 percent [15]. ConclusionCon's point that homework can sometimes kinda sorta maybe be beneficial to some people does not mean it should be mandatory for all. Outside influences have too great an impact on the alleged benefits of HW. Students, parents and teachers can ASSIGN homework, encourage it, grade it but not REQUIRE it given all of the problematic variables. This allows for HW's benefits but also accounts for its problems.SOURCES: http://www.debate.org...", "qid": 47, "docid": "ae7c3aca-2019-04-18T13:14:06Z-00003-000", "score": 7.860199928283691}, {"content": "Title: should homework be allowed Content: I think homework should be allowed for two main reasons: it's beneficial to the students and banning it would be ridiculous.

The government is already a little too involved in the private lives of it's citizens, and this would go beyond even that. Also, banning homework would demand that you enforce that in not only public schools, but also with private schools and home-schoolers. Telling a private school that they can't issue homework would be unreasonably interfering with a private institution, which the government has no right to do. As for home-schoolers, one could say that all the work they do is homework, as it's all done at home!

Point 1 She claims that I provided no explanation of how the date is relevant. This is false. I claimed (and sourced the claim) that the education system has changed since those studies were published and also showed how inaccurate the studies were due to the fact that the percentage of people accounted for are 0.00000947368% of children! She drops this and merely claims that I fail to explain to explain how the date is relevant to the majority of her contentions. This is false as we can clearly see. She then makes a mathematical error in the dates. She claims that her sources are from 8 - 20 years ago. In fact that are from 8 - 26 years ago and I clearly sourced the claim that education and homework has significantly changed in the last 3 decades (see my source [2] from last round). She drops this. She falsely states that I must prove that homework assigned then vs now is different in quantity. This is, as I said, false. All I need to do is show that the systems of education have changed since then because that affects everything. If homework is different in regards to difficulty (for example), then higher quantity is not as necessary if it\u2019s harder. If it\u2019s easier then the opposite is applicable. So the fact that the system of education was different then is a valid reason to consider her sources (at the least, the ones from 20+ years ago); the differences are too large to compare to the present. The fact that my sources are outdated is irrelevant as my intentions and uses of them are different. If I was using those sources for statistical evidence or about the education system (which she does) then outdated sources are unacceptable. If I\u2019m using them for more generic purposes (which I am) then the date is not applicable as it does not affect my point. She cites some Con homework information in my source. I am aware that there is information in my source that I disagree with. I was using that source to reinforce a point that I agreed with in the source. I agree with some of the claims made however I disagree with the sources impact analysis and conclusion of information. Debaters are not expected to agree with everything said in every one of their sources. They are expected to agree with the statement that they are using the source to reinforce. [Counterplan] 1A. This is false. I never said that only beneficial homework is allowed. This would be ideal but not once in my counterplan was the word beneficial mentioned. In fact I only mentioned the word beneficial once in my entire round and it was not in the context in which my opponent states (anybody can check my clicking Ctrl f and searching the word beneficial whilst viewing the debate). 1B. Again, this seems to be a misinterpretation of the counterplan. I never mentioned that it had to be beneficial, nor did I say that beneficial things have to be mandatory. Here is a remind of my counterplan: Homework should be given in moderate quantity (in short). This is about homework QUANTITY (ie. how much homework is given) NOT homework QUALITY (ie. how beneficial it is). I extend the counterplan. I\u2019ll drop the claim that she quasi concedes in order to continue onwards with the debate. I\u2019ll allow voters to consider whether or not this should be viewed as a concession or not. Point 2 The point that she fails to see regarding the burden on parents is that it is in extremely low quantity and I provided accurate statistics showing that this was clearly a minority. The statistics clearly show that the majority of parents are satisfied with homework. Whether I can or can\u2019t cite a court case regarding homework quantity is irrelevant. That argument was only made as an alternative to the counterplan. Since she fails to refute the counterplan, it still stands and due to this her entire objection is negated given that all homework will be reduced to a more suitable quantity. She persists the raise the objection that family time is lost. If anything, family time is created. It is a psychological truism that teenagers (on balance) become more distant from parents and others during this period of their lives, this means that they spend less time with their parents and family [1]. Homework often involves parents helping the child and parents interacting with the child, as she correctly in his initial arguments. We can conclude that since teenagers are distant from their parents and given that parents often involves themselves with their children family time is created indirectly through homework. Different students of different abilities will not take identical amounts of time which is why, within the status quo, there are sets which are based on examination and classwork. Depending on their abilities they are each set different amounts of homework so that it will fulfill a set amount of time [3]. Whilst students are more than welcome to spend additional time on homework, schools give recommended amounts of time and usually make this clear [4]. [2] The fact that parents help with homework is a good thing. The fact that they do it is not. Since setting is based on classwork and examination parents doing homework has no negative effects. The homeworks purpose is to show a child\u2019s understanding of a topic and reinforce their knowledge of the topic from their classwork. If their parents do it then it is the same as what she proposes (ie. no homework) because they are not receiving the benefits that homework has to offer. For the students that actually do their homework, they are benefiting from homework. This contention presents no mitigation to my burden since all it does is show that some people aren\u2019t doing homework and some are. Some people benefiting from homework is better than nobody benefiting from it. She says I dropped his argument regarding different home environments however the counterplan negates this without me having to address it since there will be a lower homework quantity this means that these people will not be overwhelmed with homework - homework is not used as a primary source of determining sets. Schools also take into account financial states [5]. She helps explain the very purpose of homework itself. She points out that homework cannot be monitored in regards to approach and therefore students may not grasp or understand the material properly. If they do not understand it and get all of the questions wrong (for example), then it is the teacher\u2019s duty to correct the student and explain the homework to them. The lesson is designed to teach all students generally. The homework shows specific pupils progress and understanding of that lesson which teachers can then monitor and intervene if necessary in order to help said student to understand it properly [6]. There is a reason as to why it is a condition of the job. It allows teachers to have an individual understanding of a student\u2019s grasp of the lesson so that they can help students that are struggling [6]. Point 3 The reason I asked for sourcing is because I wanted evidence that homework actually digs into and reduces the time that people spend on certain things. Often people can still do their one activity and also do other activities in the same amount of time that they usually would do even without having the first activity, so I was merely asking for confirmational purposes. The CP negates this point since these sources reference to there being too much time being spent on homework due to excessive quantity. The fact that these activities are provided in schools is NOT irrelevant due to the fact that IF you are buying her claim that homework cuts into activity time, students will not be missing out on these activities since they will be doing it in school. She makes a an argument riddled with fallacies. She claims that homework cuts into time for anything. The fact of the matter is that schools cuts into people\u2019s time, work cuts into people\u2019s time, sleep cuts into people\u2019s time, etc. Should people stop going to school, work and stop sleeping in order to do activities? The answer that she will most likely give is no. So why is homework an exception? People still manage to have part time jobs within the status quo, in the UK homework is compulsory and there are a record number of students in part time jobs at the moment [7]. This completely negates my opponent\u2019s claims of a supposed negative correlation. She misunderstands the counterplan. He says that I cannot ensure that less homework will be given by specific teachers. The counterplan is a proposed change in the status quo, thus making it a law for teachers to only be allowed to set a limited amount of homework. Point 4 1 - Homework counts for nothing and only is there to show a student\u2019s understanding of a lesson. So whilst parents cheating is discouraged, it still has no negative benefits that give my opponent\u2019s proposed changes any advantage over mine. 2 - There is no evidence presented in support of this claim. 3 - Whilst cheating can be the case and the same objection to 4 - 1 is applicable here. Her statistics are unreliable. They are posted on a forum site and a bias one too. The site stophomework.com. The website makes little attempt to give credibility to these statistics and the only effort made is where they provide 3 fake links that lead to nonexistent / fake pages. [Conclusion] She provides her sources in an external link which shows a poor demonstration of conduct. She set a character limit and this limit was violated. I have abided by the rules set and not attempted to bypass them in the way that she does. I ask that voters vote on the conduct point as this gave her additional space for rebuttals and gave me limited space for counter rebuttals. More generally, the decision is simple.

Content: For this round of debate, I will state my contentions and provide supporting evidence as to why they are viable. 1) Large amounts of homework are bad for children. \"Nancy Kalish's daughter was an enthusiastic middle-schooler -- until homework started to take over, consuming her evenings and weekends. When she started dreading school, the Brooklyn mom began to grow alarmed.\" This is just one of many cases where children are being overworked to the point where a mother or father might get involved. A group of Australian researchers have stated that, \"Piling on the homework doesn't help kids do better in school. In fact, it can lower their test scores.\" Furthermore, according to Richard Walker, an educational psychologist at Sydney University, countries where students spend excessive time on homework prove to have worse results on standardized tests. These three pieces of evidence prove that homework is overworking children. In some cases, overworking be beneficial, but overwork defined by Oxford dictionary is, \"exhaust with too much work.\" Going back to my first example about the daughter of Kalish, exhaust has proved to alert her mother so much that she wrote, \"The Case Against Homework: How Homework Is Hurting Our Children and What We Can Do About It,\" to further prove her point. For this reason, I urge a con ballot. I have a question for you. If these large amounts of homework are negatively impacting student's test scores, how is this beneficial to a student's future life? Keep in mind that test scores such as the SAT are a huge part of college acceptance. http://www.parenting.com... http://www.livescience.com...", "qid": 47, "docid": "c6512081-2019-04-18T16:44:37Z-00002-000", "score": 7.64709997177124}, {"content": "Title: Homework should be banned Content: Let's begin!

First I would like to come back on what you said. If students are given extra-classes in Asia, or in any other country, that is in order to help those students who might have difficulties but still want to progress. Therefore, teachers giving those extra-classes will be there only to help the students, for instance with doing his homework. I doubt they also give extra-homework, unless if the students are really looking forward to delving into courses. Even in that case, I think that if a student gives up his studies it is because courses are too difficult for him or because he is not motivated enough but not because of homework he sometimes can't manage to do. Then, I would like to point out that homework such as exercises are great for the student because it gives him the possibility to put what he learnt into practice and to be sure he has understood the concepts seen in class. For example homework in mathematics or physics allow the student to move from abstract ideas and formulas to concrete examples. Afterwards when the homework get corrected, he will know whether he was right or wrong. In both cases it is beneficial as he can either be sure he understood or understand the mistake he made, not to make it again. Finally, it is generally agreed that working regularly leads to better results, the brain being able to memorize information easier if they are constantly repeated. That is one of the reasons why homework is beneficial to students, indeed it obliges the student to work when he is at home. Doing so, he will review what he learnt early on and it amounts to the same thing, that is to say to work in a constant way in order to better succeed. Last but not least, doing homework allows the student to develop skills such as a better organization, efficiency or memorising abilities. By way of conclusion, I can't see why would homework be something bad or useless, as its main goal is to help students getting better by raising the difficulties they could be facing and by consolidating what they are good at.

Content: Since my opponent has mostly dropped their position, and it's with a logical position: for some students, homework is good and others it is not. There is good logic in that. My opponent did ask about how students view homework, and this is what I found through a quick search: 65% of students view homework as a waste of time, 50% view homework as being overly challenging or simply too difficult, and 29% of the students believed homework was interesting[5]Now, this may not be able to tell us too much, because this is based on how homework currently is. These numbers would likely change if homework was made in such a way where the students got to have a say over what was involved in the homework. I think teachers should just have a overall guideline on what students need to know, and then the students could then create their own homework that teaches them this topic. This would likely increase the amount of students who would find homework interesting(as it's low) since they would get to have a say in what the assignment is. Thus, to reiterate some things, homework shouldn't be completely elliminated, but it should have input from the students so that the students get to do what they believe is most beneficial for them. We don't all learn things the same way, and that would be most beneficial in my opinion, Maybe some students would choose to go without homework, and I think that is fine.Sources:[5]http://ro.ecu.edu.au...", "qid": 47, "docid": "a5d6b89f-2019-04-18T12:19:28Z-00000-000", "score": 7.514100074768066}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: Large amounts of homework are beneficial to the student.

There is the evidence folks, and like I said before it helps people overcome their problems and to achieve goals such as higher test score (also known as growth in education) to help society function correctly, and with a wise mind. If you don\"t believe me about this test here is another test conducted carried out by the researchers at Duke University. \" DURHAM, N.C. - It turns out that parents are right to nag: To succeed in school, kids should do their homework. Duke University researchers have reviewed more than 60 research studies on homework between 1987 and 2003 and concluded that homework does have a positive effect on student achievement. Harris Cooper, a professor of psychology and director of Duke's Program in Education, said the research synthesis that he led showed the positive correlation was much stronger for secondary students --- those in grades 7 through 12 --- than those in elementary school. \"With only rare exception, the relationship between the amount of homework students do and their achievement outcomes was found to be positive and statistically significant,\" the researchers report in a paper that appears in the spring 2006 edition of \"Review of Educational Research.\"\" Cooper is the lead author; Jorgianne Civey Robinson, a Ph.D. student in psychology, and Erika Patall, a graduate student in psychology, are co-authors. (Brought to you by http://today.duke.edu...) Once again readers, there is the evidence that homework is beneficial. Therefore, there is no reason for it not to be beneficial on weekends. Ultimately, homework given to students on the weekend is beneficial. If I still do not have you on board with my side I suggest reading this extra evidence. Homework set prior to a lesson can aid understanding later in class. Homework also provides opportunities for reinforcement of work learned during school time and for children to develop their research skills. Children will need to seek information for themselves from reference materials such as encyclopaedias, books, CD ROMs and by doing so, are helped along the path to becoming independent learners. Having the responsibility of needing to meet deadlines promotes self-discipline, an attribute that will impact on schoolwork and beyond. (Brought to you by http://www.topmarks.co.uk...) Thank you everyone for staying tuned in on my side of the case for: whether or not students should have homework over the weekends. Yes they should. Hey, I appreciate everything you guys and hope to for the final round of this debate to wrap up my argument with an overall conclusion of my case and how this, being my first debate, has been.

The Con argues that homework is more bad than good.Therefore, I can only provide evidence that homework is generally more beneficial for the student.As a matter of fact, homework pays off!The benefits are the obvious: It helps children develop positive study skills and habits that will serve them well throughout life Homework encourages children to use their time wisely It teaches children to work independently Homework teaches children to take responsibility for his or her work [1] Besides any disputed educational effects, the latter are reasons homework is beneficial for all children, no matter how old, how well they do, or how much they struggle.Study habits, time management, independence, and responsibility are characteristics that all people need to progress in life, for whatever career path they choose to take. Yes, it is true, homework causes some stress and may result in family disputes. (But not make kids fat. Read this inaccurate and irrelevant article, and you'll understand why I don't buy it. [2])Yet, it can be argued, and I am arguing, that the general benefits outweigh any handicaps. Not only that- but I guarantee that in a majority of the cases in which students are becoming less active or belligerent over homework, the parents are to blame. When students have massive amounts of electronic games or television to watch, why expect them to do homework instead. If every parent were to remove the distractions from the household, then you would have the select few students that genuinely struggle with education and the few situations where homework actually hinders the student pyschologically.

Teachers in the school have already given assignments or lessons to the students. The most crucial thing is that the students learn or gain something fruitful from the schools.Some research indicates no direct relationship between learning and homework, whereas other studies state that homework can cause stress in young students and that students from lower-income homes may not have access to the same amount of parental assistance and resources as students from higher-income homes. We just have to ensure the students score with flying colors in their exams and understanding towards all the subjects. As you can seen in above statement, homework causes stress to students. Especially in Asia region, parents like to sign up extra-classes after school for students to brush up their studies. They have to do the homework which is assigned by the teachers from school and extra-classes. If we remain in this state-quo, students will just get too stresses out and give up their studies.

Students waste a lot of time on social media, on the Internet, playing video games, etc. It is okay to use those things in with limitations when you are taking a break from something and trying to lower stress by doing something you love but mindlessly wasting their time and using these things to an over-extent is not something they should be doing. Studies show that students who have homework and do it get better test grades and overall grades in school than ones who do not have any homework. In my closing statement I would like to say that having and doing homework, but not too much of it, is beneficial in learning from a student and teaches them life skills they will use in the real world as well as giving them something useful to do instead of wasting their time.

It can put too much stress on the child and family.My opponent argues that it \"is possible that too much homework causes too much stress\".This is something I will admit. It is only logical. But I miss - and refute - any reasoning why homework should be completely banned on these grounds. By the same argumentation, ANYTHING would have to be banned, as there is a \"too much\" of anything.Too much water will kill you.[1]Too much oxygen in your lungs can kill you (commonly known as hyperventilation) [2]Should we ban those, too?The research I offered shows that the PROPER amount of homework is beneficial, leading only to one conclusion:Regulate homework instead of banning it.Even my opponent's OWN SOURCE doesn't speak in favour of banning homework:\"Teachers need to be much more clear about why they are assigning homework and what the homework is for,\" Tai said. \"If teachers aren't really incorporating homework into their teaching, it's unclear there is any type of benefit at all and it actually may end up hurting students.\"[3]This, again, clearly calls for a regulation of homework, not an abolition.In response to:\"the US can cut out time-wasting subjects, such as health and PE.\"Firstly, this is a plan by a politician. It is not backed up with any corroborating studies that this will actually help academic performance. So it is nothing more than pure conjecture that this will actually help students improve.Secondly, my opponent did not even provide a source for this claim. While he did put a tag \"3\", there is no source given under that tag.Thirdly, health and PE are not time-wasting, as a study from 1999 confirms [4]: \"These three studies provide encouraging findings about the effects of enhanced physical education on academic performance. Two studies reported academic benefits, and one reported no difference, in spite of 14-26% reduction in instruction time for subjects other than physical education.\"In response to: \"3. When students don't have the teacher they may not have enough help.\"One essential goal of any education is to make children able to work independently [5]. They must not be raised to rely on a teacher's help all the time. How will they ever learn how to pass an exam, if that will be the first time they may not ask their teacher for help?Homework is necessary to try out strategies learned in class by oneself, so as to see whether they have been understood.Even if the homework was graded, it would make no difference in favour of my opponent's opinion-based argument.Let's say we ban homework. The student leaves class believing they understood a topic, but they have overlooked something. There is no homework to tell the student that he got stuck, but he's still stuck nonetheless. The next day the teacher comes up with a surprise test. The student fails, never understanding why, his grades are bad nonetheless. So, banning homework will not solve the problem you propose.Summarizing:You have one argument that doesn't necessitate the banning of homework. You have basically conceded that the proper amount of homework is beneficial (by saying that too much may do harm you have accepted that there's an amount that does not do harm in contrast).You have one argument without a source given in spite of claiming so.You have one opinion-based argument that doesn't lead anywhere, as it doesn't add to any solution. I have countered it with a reliable source about the goal of education.Your argument is thus completely refuted.

Before I begin rebuttals and my arguments I\u2019d just like to remind readers of arguments that I presented in R2 that haven\u2019t been countered. These points were cost, reduction in general mischief and my working mindset / lack of agrarian workforce points. Granted, the rules themselves disallowed direct rebuttal (!), but it\u2019s important to note these extensions \u2013 they are all important points. Con had best rebut them this round lest they be considered dropped by myself and readers. This leaves my other points \u2013 memory retention and homework vs. instruction somewhat up for discussion, as well as my opponent\u2019s arguments which centre on the length of the school day, the components of homework and memory / motivation. Let\u2019s go to the arguments \u2013 Con\u2019s then a focus on mine. School day length Con\u2019s first point is that increasing the school day will put pressure on the time available for extracurricular activities. His second point is that reductions in homework have negative consequences. His choice of my poison makes no sense \u2013 either there\u2019s more time allocated to homework (this is incorporated into the extra school hours) under my model and pressure is put on extracurricular activities or there\u2019s less time spent on homework despite these hours and there\u2019s more time for extracurricular activities. He can\u2019t run both points simultaneously. If the net amount of homework is the same then these points both don\u2019t apply and things stay the same. That is... aside from all the other benefits of the scheme, particularly memory retention, which we\u2019ll touch on later. Also, there\u2019s actually extra time for extracurricular activities given no change in the time spent on homework, should the student organise their day appropriately. What am I talking about? Under the current model lunch, recess and all other breaks occur at set times \u2013 they are immovable to the student; it is bad luck if you\u2019d like to sacrifice a break at school for an equivalent amount of time outside school \u2013 you can\u2019t. Under my model, as readers may recall, you can. Recall in R1 how we had 80 minutes of break built into the day, and how 40 was automatically set aside for lunch. That left 40 minutes which students could elect to have at the start or the end of the day. If they chose the day\u2019s end then they could leave school at the start of that break. So, in terms of time which students can utilise freely (hint: free time) , my model provides 20 minutes extra for extracurricular activities notwithstanding any changes in the amount of homework. Of course, if Con argues for a change in homework amount (the extra time ought to cancel out the reduction) then he gets to drink the associated poison. The value of homework Con painstakingly lays out the case for homework and it\u2019s benefits. It\u2019s a formidable case. What\u2019s the issue with it? The case applies very strongly for work done at school as well! Indeed, many points for homework are made stronger when it is done at school. Let\u2019s take a look. On Con\u2019s list of 7 points: On preparation, school also prepares students. On scheduling, school more formally schedules a student\u2019s time than they do at home \u2013 there\u2019s less drifting and procrastination. On control and assessment, it is far easier to assess students and control them when they are there under a teacher\u2019s eye than at home! On love and care, homework can promote this, but it can harm as well \u2013 parents get frustrated at the school for impinging on their free time. From his 3rd article: \u201cIn the worst cases, children who fare less well in tests based on homework, get more homework to do. Peter Frost concludes that many children suffer from the effects of homework: it causes much conflict in the home\u201d . See above for why my model grants more free time for family time. Identity and status: Con says homework promotes a subject\u2019s importance; so does more lessons and homework done in school. On community, homework may promote contact between teacher and parent, but work at school promotes teacher-student bonds. It\u2019s a null impact. On work performance, children may carry out other tasks they deem more important than homework in the additional free time they have. Con then discusses how homework ought to be given out and how students whose parents have greater educational success do more homework. It\u2019s a good educational lesson, but Con doesn\u2019t specify how it makes homework done at home better. Then homework is given out at the same intervals, and it\u2019s done in a spaced manner (spaced presentation is better than massed presentation) . As to educationally minded parents encouraging the completion of homework being beneficial, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Parents without the right mindset can affect their children\u2019s future. That\u2019s why we need trained professionals in the field of education \u2013 teachers \u2013 to instill this mindset. Teachers also have more time, and incentive (they are getting paid) to do this as opposed to parents. Hence, my model actually encourages children from worse backgrounds to do more of their homework (and get the benefits) as per Con\u2019s logic. Memory retention and homework Con is 100% right to say that homework reviews what is done in the classroom and that this review is beneficial. I couldn\u2019t agree more, but again, Con\u2019s points don\u2019t argue for his model. They\u2019re applicable to both. Now, as to when and where this review is done in, as well as the emotional state of mind, that\u2019s a completely different thing \u2013 there are differences between home and school. In R2 I outlined how spaced presentation was superior to massed presentation for memory retention purposes, and how school promoted spaced presentation by virtue of the lessons being spaced out on the timetable. Indeed, school forces spaced presentation vs. the massed presentation of the home. This point was completely ignored by Con (he couldn\u2019t rebut last round though) and is critical to my case. But it doesn\u2019t end there for memory retention. I recently read Memory by Jonathan K. Foster (first published 2009), one of OUP\u2019s fascination very short introductions. To quote one part: \u201cOther things being equal, we tend to remember information better if we are in a similar physical context and emotional state at the time we wish to retrieve information as we were in at the time we were exposed to that information.\u201d School is more akin to work than the home environment, so as per a more similar physical context we remember better. This is specified in the encoding specificity principle. Also, the emotional state at school is more constant than at home, more like work. This again promotes better memory retention as the retrieval cue matches memories better. This sort of logic strongly explains why we can\u2019t remember dreams \u2013 the physical context is different, our emotional state different and our physiological state are also different. To recap, homework done at school is done in a manner of spaced presentation. This is superior for memory retention. Furthermore, recall is strengthened by a similar emotional state and physical context, which happens when learning is conducted more strongly in a given place, such as school. Memory is strengthened tremendously by shifting homework to school time. Homework vs. Instruction This wasn\u2019t considered \u2018not attacked\u2019 , but it was close to that. As said in R2, teachers can assist if homework is moved into school time. At home a student may waste time aimlessly, not learn the content as well, or worse cheat or copy answers if they can. Teacher supervision prevents cheating, assists in learning content and reduces time wasted. Professional instruction is beneficial for students vs. self learning in many cases. Conclusion Con must refute the points of this round + those of mine unscathed of mine by his R2 (in part as per the rules).

Content: I will be arguing that it would be more likely beneficial for the students and the educators if homework was given out on the weekend. My argument is not stating that there is a direct causation of success and homework as that is currently still being debated [1]. However I am stating that homework in general is more likely a beneficial component in education rather than harmful. A. Homework is an important instructional tool. 1. Purpose of homework. There are two types of homework, instructional and noninstructional. In the case of instructional it is: preparation, practice, extension, and integration [1]. The purpose of instructional homework is to further improve on skills, knowledge that was or will be covered, and allow students to utilize their multiple skills to complete a complex project. Noninstructional homework is used to develop social interactions and behavioral skills. 2. Homework is correlated to be a benefiting factor with more positive effects. Extensive studies by Harris M. Cooper continually show a correlation between students who complete homework versus students that do not, especially on test covering direct material on assignments. His research simply states that, despite constant argumentation to dispute any correlation, homework does more good than harm [2]. In general, based on various studies, the effects of homework have shown a gain of 20-30 percentiles [3]. Even though, some may debate the benefits that come from homework, we cannot ignore that it is a potentially crucial and helpful factor in education. It would be like a team of athletes that are expected to perform better than other teams but never have practice after learning a new technique/play. 3. Alternative method that allows practice of skills and teacher evaluation of retention is lacking. Simply put there is currently no other well known method for encouraging students to study material outside of the classroom, as well as encourage self-involvement with learning. Furthermore, a new method would have to allow teachers to track the progress of the students and be effective in flourishing their knowledge. I will further discuss this later. B. Main Reasons that students, and some teachers do not like homework. 1. Time Management is an important factor. On the student side many arguments can be boiled down to homework is limiting to other leisure activities and family bonding that could be reserved for weekends [4]. However, in this article, they give testimony to a child that \u201ccan\u2019t usually start [her] hours of homework until 8:30 PM,\u201d meaning that homework is already limiting within the weekday; thus, reserving homework on the weekdays would only cause more stress to the child that has to finish everything during their most busiest of days. Another argument that was given was that the children do not sleep as well during the weekends, which should be a time for resting. However according to a study by Mary Allard, male and female students spend, on average, 5.7 and 4.5 hours a day on leisure activities after school respectively [5]. In addition, the students slept 2-3 hours more on the weekends than on the weekdays, despite jobs, homework, and other social activities. It is odd that even though given homework, children are still finding more ways to rest and be social during their time off of school. On the other side of the argument, some teachers argue about the amount of time spent grading [6]. While some teachers argue that they hate grading, and others say that it is important practice work, they clearly voice that the spend too much time on the homework given back, which causes them to judge student behavior or completion rather than correct methodology of work. On average, teachers spend around 782 hours per school year teaching (in classroom) which means that on average of 180, 6-8 hour, school days, the teacher are teaching for approximately 4.34 hours [7,8]. That is assuming however, that teachers are not distracted, victim\u2019s of Murphy\u2019s Law, or working with one student in particular that really needs help [9]. That is not a lot of time to work with students in-class, as well as grade, if a teacher is not properly oriented, thus they will get backed up on teaching and homework can help keep students if given after school or on the weekend. 2. Students get burned out Some teachers have stated that homework is \u201ctime consuming, dreary, and uninspiring,\u201d to the point that children will become less motivated and apathetic toward learning [10]. In so doing, some teachers have done the extreme and do not issue any \u201chomework\u201d for their students. This was done mainly by well time management of the class and the effectiveness of the teaching. However, it is important to note that: a. While teachers claimed benefits of not doing homework, the have no definitive causation that students did better in the same regards as they criticise students that have homework. b. There is more than one type of homework, as stated above, and an assignment that is meant to help children practice a skill is what practice homework enriches at home. Also, children were able to finish \u201chomework\u201d in school just as much as outside of school. Thus all the teachers are doing is allotting more class time to homework, assuming the children are retaining information or completing their work. c. Homework is more than just practice, as stated above, it is important social tool. Otherwise you are limiting a student from learning how to study intensely on their own in higher learning, thus they will also be less likely successful without proper time management skills when they start their careers [11, 12].

Argument Structure1 Fairness1a: for students that already understood the material and could spent time otherwise1b: for students of non-supportive homes being left alone with the homework1c: for students of overly caring homes where parents involvement makes proper feedback impossible2 Learning Success Factors 2a: homework =!= understanding2b: time loss due to homework control/ review3 Benefits of Spare Time3a: self-esteem / mental health3b: positive learning experience with hobbies3c: ensuring physical health as basis for successful learningConclusionArgumentation1 FairnessWhy homework is discriminative and unbalanced1a: for students that already understood the material and could spent time otherwiseThere are many different subjects you have to take or voluntarily take at school. Math is very different than History or Business economics in terms of what you learn and how you remember it. But as teachers try to be fair, they try to give an equal amount of homework for each subject. Which turns out to be not fair. Because students, that already understood one subjects material will spent an equal amount of workload on subjects they are strong at as on subjects they are weak at. Which can mask the real problem they might have in a weak subject. Or cause frustration due to the overall workload that doesn't offer enough time to focus on the real problems while making the student do over and over again, what he already can and knows. Compulsory homework does not adapt the students individual abilities. It forces work on him/her that is therefore likely to be either too difficult or too easy. 1b: for students of non-supportive homes being left alone with the homeworkFamilies are very diverse these days. But generally schools assume that parents help the younger kids with their homework while they don't take their time for this when the kids are older. Which is an assumption that sometimes misses reality harshly.Kids from households of parents/single-parents that work a lot often face their homework alone from an early age, being left behind in school afterwards by kids that get extensive care from their parents. UE published a list of reasons they gathered from students about why they skipped homework and lacking the equipment and quiet place was also a common problem {1} . This is especially a problem for low-income households that they simply can't provided what is needed.One might say that homework is therefore discriminative against kids from poor and undereducated homes from the very beginning when skills are learned that really are mostly based on repetition rather than understanding (such a reading). 1c: for students of overly caring homes where parents involvement makes proper feedback impossibleOn the other hand are overly caring homes not that much better. They look better on the paper because the kids homework is usually proper, beautiful and correct. But how does a teacher actually know that the answers on the paper are the student ones? Parents might choose to push the abilities of their kids by giving them the answers without actually caring whether the kid understood the concept behind them, which gets more and more important around middle school, where this kind of parenting actively endangers the kids learning success {2}2 Learning Success Factors Once the kid enters middle school and has to understand complex ideas and concepts, repetition is no longer the only key to success.2a: Homework =!= UnderstandingRepetition of different problems all sharing the same solution method is necessary to develop skills in Art, Math or Chemistry or for Writing and Reading. But how fast these skills develop is a very diverse thing. That's why standardised homework assigns a broad kind of repetition often not targeting the individual problems. It is not necessary to understand the problem solution method, but requires it. One who did not understand at school will not be able to complete the homework successfully. Even for maths, studies have shown that homework has barely any relevance for the actual understanding and long term performance of the student {3}Independent reading and research to gain new skills is rarely the core of homework and requires especially supervision considering the problems of nowadays research methods such as the internet. A twelve year old should not be browsing on his own, the flood of relevant and irrelevant information is too big and it takes years to learn how to filter good sources from bad sources from irrelevant sources. 2b: time loss due to homework control/ reviewHomework needs to be checked. From the teacher to make sure the students actually did them (it's compulsory) and for the student to make sure he did not develop a totally wrong approach to the problem. This i. takes up relevant time at the beginning of the class that could have been better filled with supervised exercisesii. relies on the student actively participating in the correction timeORi. is done by the teacher which means students will get the results (and the message: you don't understand this) probably days after the topic was relevant and are thenii. left alone with the problem to solve this lack of understanding3 Benefits of Spare Time3a: raising self-esteem and reality-connection to prevent bullying /mental healthThe self-esteem of a kid is necessary to give them a positive learning environment. Or to say it different: happy people are better learners {4}. A kid that has time to develop a self-confidence outside the school can bring that in an is less likely to become bullied or be a bully or be a drop-out. Sport, a hug, art and nature, all this helps kids to feel peaceful, save and loved {4}. If we don't offer kids the time to do all this without feeling like they have to skip school work for it or without feeling rushed, we seriously endanger their mental health. Depression and Burn out becomes more and more relevant for school kids. The pressure of bringing the school home via homework contributes to this problem {5}.3b: positive learning experience Reality is beneficial. Talking to adults and mates freely is beneficial. Having the time to develop a hobby is especially beneficial. How people learn a positive image of learning on their own? By having something that makes them do research and learn on their own. If all the learning you ever do is what you are forced to, how can you have a positive image of learning?3c: ensuring physical health as basis for successful learningSport keeps you health. It's good for your teamwork-skills, self-discipline, goal setting {6} and it offers you to make new friends that don't go to your school, don't know that people there mock your for your nose and call you funny names. But especially: it keeps your body fit and shows you how to develop a healthy lifestyle {6}. Being constantly sick or suffering from physical problems early in life is likely to reduce your performance at school and later at work and the benefits of teaching children the joy of sports outside a forced environment like school can only be of long-term benefit.

I'm not sure how exactly to respond to your point about children having to do too much of it, as I don't know the country that you're based in or and I also don't know how you define a substantial amount of homework. These are the reasons why I think that it is beneficial and is not a waste of time if the above criteria is met: 1. It allows for the development of time management skills within students, since they have to manage their homework with the time constraints given. The source cited states that homework is important in the process of self regulation and control. [1] 2. Homework forces students to apply the knowledge that they learned in the classroom, which is especially important for development of intellect, as being able to apply knowledge of a given topic is what allows you to utilize it within your everyday life. While you may not be able to directly apply trigonometry into your life, the type of thought processes that mathematics hinges on can give students a better ability apply study skills in their everyday lives. [2] 3. Homework reinforces education, which while may not be directly applicable, it is crucially important for survival in an increasingly modern economic marketplace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has data that shows that the unemployment rate increases 3.25 times when comparing people over 25 with a doctoral degree and those who only have a high school diploma (1.6% to 5.2%). It also shows that the difference between these two groups when it comes to full time weekly earnings is that those with a high school diploma earn 2.41 times less than those with a doctoral degree. [3] 4. There is also a link between the amount of education one has and their estimated IQ. While IQ may not be the end-all-be-all determiner of intelligence, it gives us a good idea of one's general intellectual capabilities. On page 63 of Coming Apart, Charles Murray displays a graph that shows that the difference between those who don't have a degree and those with a high school diploma is 11 and 12 (82-89, 05-09), and the difference between those with a diploma and a PHD or its equivalents are 27 and 25 respectively, this shows that there are relatively significant differences in IQ between people who have radically different amounts of education.

Con claims that homework teaches kids responsibility. He says when kids (don't) do homework, they learn that it is their fault and \"NOT THE PARENT'S FAULT\" that it is turned in late. Please extend all of my Point 2 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. Respected teacher John Spencer notes, \"Homework doesn\u2019t teach kids responsibility. It teaches compliance. A better solution is self-directed, independent, optional learning\" [1]. A student exemplifies responsibility when they take ownership of their own education and look to improve it by choice. Completing tasked assignments to avoid disciplinary action isn't necessarily an indicator of responsibility. Moreover, many of the alleged benefits of homework (such as teaching responsibility) can be acquired through other, more beneficial endeavors [2]. For example participating in athletics arguably encourages more responsibility than homework [3]. Kids have to learn to keep to a schedule, work on a team, concentrate, persevere through adversity, practice, and all while enjoying the added benefits of exercise, improved motor skills, better health and stress relief. However kids won't have time to pursue these other endeavors if they are saddled with homework.Jobs teach kids responsibility - should we mandate jobs for that reason alone? Just because something may (or may not) be beneficial does not mean it ought to be required. 2. Homework also provides kids with the ability to manage their own time.Please extend my Point 3 and Point 4 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. A child's homework completion or performance is not only dependent on their time, but that of their family and care giver's schedule. Kids already \"work\" in school all day, and should have free time after school to pursue other endeavors (or practice their academic endeavors individually according to their needs or parental preferences). Some have pointed out that assigning homework in and of itself is a reflection of the teacher's own poor time management in sufficiently managing the curriculum [4]. Adults lament having to take their work home with them, and often suffer as a direct result [5]. We should not impose the same burdens on children unnecessarily. 3. My opponent claims that homework helps kids get better grades on their tests.Please extend my Point 1 arguments as a rebuttal to this contention. Con presents one source noting 5 or 12 studies that allegedly link value between homework and academic achievement. I've presented numerous studies contending the exact opposite in the last round. Here is some more research:\"Students enrolled in college physics courses were surveyed to determine whether any features of their high schoolphysics courses were now of use to them. At first a very small relationship was found between the amount of homework that students had had in high school and how well they were currently faring. But once the researchers controlled for other variables, such as the type of classes they had taken, that relationship disappeared. The researchers then studied a much larger population of students in college science classes \u2013 and found the same thing: homework simply didn\u2019t help.\"Philip M. Sadler and Robert H. Tai, 'Success in Introductory College Physics: The Role of High School Preparation,' Science Education 85 [2001]: 111-36. In fact homework doesn't teach kids to practice the skills they have been taught, but rather \"drill and kill\" information that does not develop meaning. \"Learning isn\u2019t just a matter of absorbing new information or acquiring automatic responses to stimuli. Rather, we human beings spend our entire lives constructing theories about how the world works, and then reconstructing them in light of new evidence. Not only educational theorists but virtually all cognitive researchers today \u201c[sub]scribe to this constructive view of learning and knowledge. The kind of teaching most consistent with it treats students as meaning makers and offers carefully calibrated challenges that help them to develop increasingly sophisticated theories. The point is for them to understand ideas from the inside out\" [6]. If I have to present even more research next round I will, or I can expand on why my studies have better quality than Con's. But the takeaway should be that my research should be accepted because there is no good reason to accept that homework's \"drill and kill\" provides a positive educational impact.

Content: 1) Homework helps kids exercise the skills they need to pass, and accelerate in education. According to the \"National Education Association\"(NEA), Individualized assignments that tap into students' existing skills or interests can be motivating. It states that kids at an elementary school level, can help develop study skills and habits that the child will need later on, as he/she passes onto secondary education. They also state that homework is associated with greater academic achievement, such as kids getting A's on tests and some making it into higher education statues such as the \"honor roll\". In an article published by Doug Gavel from Harvard University, he states in his report that \"The assignment of homework, over time, serves to foster the kinds of qualities that are critical to learning -- persistence, diligence, and the ability to delay gratification,\" she continued. \"These [skills] become increasingly necessary as students graduate to higher levels of scholarship in middle school, high school, and beyond.\" Sitting in a room and simply listening and participating in class activities, sometimes isn't enough. If you want to master the skills and exceed in certain subjects, it takes personal time, and effort at home. School isn't the only place on the Earth where people learn new things. Just like learning a new instrument, you can't become a professional just by going to lessons. You need to take what you've learned, and improve on them at home, or somewhere else that doesn't have the influence of a teacher or guardian. You must take the wheel into your own hands, and drive your own path of knowledge using your own mind and body. For this reason, I urge a pro ballot. It's not beneficial to a students future, if their test scores are dropping due to homework, but knowledge is more important than test scores. Even though test scores are impotant, especially if you want to be accepted into a college. They do not always show the true amount of knowledge a being can have.

Why are we posing such a ludicrous question about the possible abolishment of homework if doing homework is what it takes to succeed in school? It is a common emotion to students regarding the distaste of homework, but legions of teachers know better because they recognize the importance of homework in the success of students in school and outside of school. Not only does homework accomplishment benefit the student, it also benefits the teacher as well. Teachers receive the opportunity to see at what stage the student is by assigning homework. Furthermore, the teacher can identify the weaknesses of the student so they can ameliorate their study habits in hopes of pulling their grades up. On the other hand, if teachers were to abandon the idea of homework altogether, they would have to base the majority of the student's mark on tests alone.

Parents rarely get to spend much time with you while you're at school. Homework allows them to keep up with what you're doing in your classes on a daily basis. But you don't have homework purely for your parents' benefit. It's good for you, too! Homework can help you become a better student in several different ways. First of all, homework given in advance of a particular subject can help you make the most of your classroom discussion time. For example, before beginning a discussion of a complex period in history, it can be very helpful to read background information as homework the night before. Homework also gives you valuable practice with what you've learned in the classroom. Often, the brief period of time you have during class to learn something new is simply not enough. Repeating classroom concepts at home helps to cement in your mind the things you learned. For example, you've probably experienced the value of homework when it comes to mathematics. A new concept explained in class might seem foreign at first. With repetition via homework, however, you reinforce what you learned in class and it sticks with you. Without homework, a lot of classroom time would be wasted with repetition that could more easily be done outside the classroom. In these ways, homework expands upon what is done during the day in the classroom. Your overall educational experience is better, because homework helps you to gain and retain more knowledge than would be possible with only classroom work. As you learn more, you know more and you achieve more\"and you have homework to thank! Homework teaches lessons beyond just what's taught in the classroom, too. Bringing homework home, completing it correctly, and turning it in promptly teaches a host of other important life skills, from time management and responsibility to organization and prioritization. Despite these benefits found by researchers, the topics of who should receive homework and how much homework are hotly debated among educators and researchers. In one study, researchers found that academic gains from homework increased as grade level increased, suggesting homework is more beneficial for older students. Some researchers have found that too much homework can lower or cancel its benefits and become counterproductive, because students become burned out.", "qid": 47, "docid": "1733c6bb-2019-04-18T11:28:17Z-00000-000", "score": 6.759699821472168}, {"content": "Title: Homework is immoral on a deep level.

I disagreed so much with homework that I even called in to a local AM radio show when they were on the topic of homework to voice my opinion. Then came high school and college. My whole opinion of the system reversed. For once in my life I realized what the point of homework was and how beneficial it was to understanding and reinforcing the material that was learned in class. The average high school class is 45 minutes long. In that time you take 5 minutes to organize the class and the rest teaching. In that 40 minutes of teaching it is impossible to reinforce the topics introduced enough to embed them in the minds of the students. That is where homework comes in. Homework reinforces the work that was taught in class and allows the child to fully absorb the information that was presented to them. In college, homework is essential. Without it most of the student population would be lost in translation. Sitting in a lecture hall of 400 students listening to an a professor talk in a monotonic voice doesn't allow anyone to learn anything, it mearly provides a guideline of what needs to be studied and what homework needs to be done to learn the material. Is homework immoral in some cases? Yes. Homework is immoral when it is assigned just to give a student homework and not to reinforce material that was presented earlier in the day.

Both sides of the argument have numerous reasons for their decision, but here are some of the reasons why homework should not be banned from schools. First of all, homework encourages students to undertake independent learning which they will be required to do when they get to University. Many people argue that schools spoon-feed their students, which makes them completely unprepared for what awaits them at higher education when all research and further reading must be done on the student\"s own time. By setting homework in the form of projects, students will be able to learn on their own and develop skills that will serve them well in later life. It also helps to teach the students responsibility and time management skills, seeing as the teacher is not there to make them learn. Secondly, a lot of students prefer to learn on their own and teach themselves, rather than having a teacher lecture them. Homework encourages children to do this and may also help them to revise it more thoroughly. Whatever students have learnt in the classroom can then be reinforced and solidified by completing homework tasks. Homework can also be beneficial for the teacher as when they collect homework in to mark it, it gives them a good idea of how much their students understand what is being taught. Practice makes perfect as the saying goes. So the only way to get better at algebra is to practice it, which is why teachers set homework. It help to encourage a great number of skills that students will find extremely useful not only in school and any further education that they may go on to, but also in jobs that they will have.", "qid": 47, "docid": "bfd69562-2019-04-18T17:38:09Z-00002-000", "score": 6.723599910736084}, {"content": "Title: Homework Should be Banned, or at Least Made Optional Content: Thank you for your welcome, and also your clarification, but I do know what utilitarianism and active & passive mean. While homework does have its benefits, which you mentioned, such as improving student's grades, scores, and futures, the cons of homework far outweigh them. Homework can clarify the subject, but if the concepts have not been learned once class is over, the homework becomes pointless. School is, and kids lives in general are, already immensely stressful without homework. Clear relationships between student's stress and ailments (physical and mental) have been found . I am again going to emphasise that homework should be limited. Though you make an excellent point about time restrictions, many teachers assign time-consuming homework that no one could complete quickly, no matter how intelligent they are or how well they understand the concept. If homework were to be limited to a few nights a week, this would open up more time for kids to be kids. I cannot speak for everyone when I say this, but at my school, we have at least four hours of homework total. Per night. Add in school, extracurriculars, meals, and sleep, and that leaves little to no time for freetime. No matter how well you manage your time, there will always be something that does not fit. If you were to try to squeeze in some freetime, you would most likely end up giving up some sleep, which would impair your performance at school the next day. As most kids enjoy having freetime, this is often the case. Therefore, I must say that, though homework is intended for a good cause (that is, improving ability), the ideals commonly get lost in the stress that balancing the different aspects of your life, and homework becomes more of a burden than a helper. You mentioned that homework benefits teachers, but I would have to differ. Homework does show teachers whether the material is clear or not, but it creates extra work for them (as well as the students). Now they not only have mountains of classwork, tests, and projects to grade, they have to grade daily homework as well. This is more evidence why even just limiting the amounts of homework would be beneficial. As for benefiting the nation, you yourself mentioned that the issue we have does not lie within homework, but rather within emphasis on athleticism. In that way, homework is unrelated, and not the fix for the issue: stronger emphasis on education through something such as more personalised learning is.", "qid": 47, "docid": "503cf2fa-2019-04-18T16:18:09Z-00002-000", "score": 6.72130012512207}, {"content": "Title: That Homework Should be Banned Content: Hello Debate.Org. I am here to convince you that homework shouldn't be banned and why it is beneficial for you. I will speak about two points,my first point being that homework builds a sense of responsibility and commitment towards schoolwork and my second point being that homework builds on skills that are learnt in class. My first point is that homework builds a sense of responsibility and commitment towards schoolwork. Everyone will have to face the fact that one day they would have to get a job, most jobs require the skill of responsibility and organisation. This is achieved by homework. Studies have proven that homework does improve the stability of a student in school. A study has (where is the study from reference) compared the achievement of 20 students who have homework and who do not in 1962 (try and find a newer stat, they can rebut and say that it is too old). The results were outstanding, 14 students showed a benefit in doing homework, meanwhile 6 felt no benefit at all. I myself am very busy, having out of school activities and other assigned tasks from other classes. \"Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world\" this is quoted by Nelson Mandela. He is telling us that we can do anything we want, we can go anywhere we want to be if we are given the right education. Homework brings up the skill of participation, this increases each student\"s individual involvement in applying specific skills and knowledge while enjoying learning. This brings me to my second point, homework builds on skills that are learnt in class. Only the talented will pick up tricky maths and confusing science equations in one lesson, having homework improves your skill of the subject. Have you ever heard of the saying \"practice makes perfect\" this falls into play with homework. Homework gives each student an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of skills taught in class; to increase speed, mastery and maintenance of skills. According to an article published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, homework gives you positive affects such as advancing your knowledge of the subject and opening your mind up to learn and create. Harris Cooper, an educational psychologist, performed a \"meta-analysis\" which is a statistical technique for combining numerous studies into the equivalent of one giant study. Cooper performed a meta-analysis on numerous homework studies. About 70% of these found that homework was associated with higher achievements in learning. Henceforth homework broadens knowledge and builds on skills that are learnt in class.", "qid": 47, "docid": "b7e16db9-2019-04-18T14:29:56Z-00002-000", "score": 6.721299171447754}, {"content": "Title: Homework should not be banned in school Content: Ok my friend, I want to point out a few invalid arguments that you posted.

Only senior students in Years 11 and 12 benefit from after-school work, associate professor Richard Walker said. \"What the research shows is that, in countries where they spend more time on homework, the achievement results are lower,\" Dr Walker, from Sydney University's Education Faculty, said.

Starting from the beginning, it seems necessary to point out that I was befuddled by my opponents use of the word \"should\" in the title of the debate. As Dictionary. com defines: Should: Must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that. My initial suspicion was that my opponent actually believed that homework should be prohibited on Halloween. That is, he does not merely believe that it would be nice if there were no homework on Halloween, but rather that homework should be legislatively barred from assignment on Halloween. My suspicion was confirmed when I read this in my opponents opening argument: \"I believe that on Halloween teachers should not be allowed to give their students homework\u2026\" My opponent then creates a false dichotomy between secular and religious holidays. He makes the assumption that students are excused from homework on religious holidays but not secular. Balderdash. Points and questions that need to be addressed by my opponent: 1. Is it true that Teachers are not allowed to assign homework on religious holidays? If so, A. Where is the scholastic policy that mandates teachers to not assign homework on religious holidays? B. What religious holidays are stipulated? If this is not so, A. Why do you find it necessary to prohibit homework on Halloween if it is not prohibited on any other holiday? Secular or otherwise. B. Why try to limit the scholastic endeavors of a teacher by mandating a homework assignment bar? In all my Middle School and High School years, I never remember having no homework on Ash Wednesday, or Good Friday. I typically even had homework over winter break. Easter is always on Sunday, and I can even recall doing homework on some fine Easter days (when Easter did not occur during Spring Break of course). The idea that special benefits are extended to religious holidays is simply not true. Special benefits, if any, are typically extended to federally recognized holidays - a recognition which does not extend to Halloween. Among the eleven federally recognized holidays, only one of them is explicitly religious, and that is Christmas day. My argument for why homework should not be barred on Halloween day: 1. It extends special benefits to a celebration that is not federally recognized - benefits that are not extended to ANY of the actual federally recognized holidays. 2. It offsets the scholastic endeavors of teachers, keeping them from requiring what may be beneficial for student learning. 3. Teachers should not be limited in the assignment of homework.

Motions to have homework banned are a phenomenon unique to the Unites States of America [1], where there has been a strong movement against homework.The international PISA study [2] has shown that US pupils perform at or slightly below the world's average, making the American system as it is not exactly a good example of efficient schooling.So, in order to arrive at a reliable conclusion about the use of homework, we may have to look at it on a global scale.1. Homework helps pupils to consolidate what they have learnedLet's first have a look at research. In 1989 and 2006, Professor Harris Cooper from the Department Of Psychology of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, conducted two reviews of a total of 180 studies on the topic of homework [3][4].His findings were consistent in that homework is beneficial to student success, unless it is overdone. \"Duke University researchers have reviewed more than 60 research studies on homework between 1987 and 2003 and concluded that homework does have a positive effect on student achievement. [...] Cooper said the research is consistent with the \"10-minute rule\" suggesting the optimum amount of homework that teachers ought to assign. The \"10-minute rule,\" Cooper said, is a commonly accepted practice in which teachers add 10 minutes of homework as students progress one grade. In other words, a fourth-grader would be assigned 40 minutes of homework a night, while a high school senior would be assigned about two hours.\"It's not exactly counter-intuitive, either: the more often a task is practiced, the better we get at it.Of course, there is - as with ANY training - always a risk of overdoing it. But that is only logical, too. So, there is a perfect amount of homework, and a \"too much\" just as well as a \"too little\" - as with anything in life.Abolishing homework would rob students of a chance to be better in school. There can be no doubt about that, and keeping people from improving would impede their civil rights.Homework is thus important and must be offered to pupils. It must be regulated not to overtax them. 2. Homework is an important diagnostic toolTeachers have limited resources. They can not be there for students all day, they need time to prepare lessons, review exams and be prepared to solve conflicts. They also have a right to a family life of their own, and should participate in continued training in order to be able to offer their students the best possible education. This means that ways have to be found to aid the teachers in their task of helping children get through school.Homework is an important part of this.Teachers work with their students in school teaching them subject matter. Assessment of their progress is necessary to ensure that pupils do not fail their exams. Homework is the perfect way of doing this. Students perform tasks without assistance from the teacher, under conditions not too different from an exam. By correcting these exercises, teachers can evaluate which student needs more attention and invite parents to consult them on how to support their child if the need arises.There simply isn't enough time in class to watch every student's performance. Besides, a vast majority of students is afraid of exams. Assessing students' performance in class would be just that: an exam. Homework is far less stressful, because it's usually not graded. Mistakes uncovered in homework don't harm students' grades, they are just a chance for pupil and teacher to realize where more work might be needed.3. Homework teaches more than subject materialSome people complain that homework is repetitive and seems to serve no purpose.But that is an experience all too familiar from professional careers as adults [5]. Many professional workers feel that their existence is filled with repetitive, useless work. This puts a lot of stress on them.Being prepared for this is something crucial for the process of growing up. For children, life is all fun and games. As adults, they have to set all of that aside during working hours. And when will they learn how to cope with that experience? Class is different from work, as there is always an authority in front of the students, talking to them. The students don't have to actually produce something, they are recipients of instruction. Homework, however, is quite similar to the actual working experience: being isolated, performing the same task over and over again, without any apparent reward. But homework - if put to use appropriately - only takes up a maximum of two hours a day, as opposed to a \"nine to five\" job. The result is that children are prepared for their later life and are less likely to succumb to the stress of a working life then. Routine is the key word here. Occasional reports or other long-term assignments just don't serve the same purpose of getting children used to this situation.But homework does even more than that.Doing exercises for practice in school with the assistance of a teacher makes students dependent on exterior help. They can never learn to think for themselves and solve problems on their own with a teacher always looking over their shoulder. I can sadly only offer my personal experience as a tutor in that respect. In my country, there are private schools that work without homework, where teachers assist students in school, even during exams. As a result, when these children transfer to a public school, they fail miserably whenever they are asked to perform any task all by themselves. But these skills are essential for students. At the very least, every student is completely deserted during the final exam. If the students have not learned by then how to cope with work assignments all by themselves. Homework is an important step towards self-sufficiency. And while long-term assignments do serve the same purpose, they do not really help children learn how to deal with the stress of close deadlines.The purpose of school is to get students ready for the working life. And we're not talking about rocket science here. Even hamburger vendors are required to work pressed for time. So if children are not introduced to that concept, they would fail miserably at any job out there.Is this a nice experience? No. But neither are hunger, fatigue or fear. Yet it is important not to be overprotective. Keeping any negative experience away from children harms their development [6]. Is it fair that sometimes we have to work things out all by ourselves? No, but that's how things are in LIFE. Suppose you're on a lonely road and your car breaks down. It requires practice to fight down the uprising panic, remain calm and find a solution to the problem. A child without that practice might just run off into one direction planlessly or curl up into a ball and hope that help will arrive all by itself. But the practice of overcoming fear and panic can only come from experience. Homework will help children acquire this important skill on a rather nonhazardous level. The worst thing that can happen is a little bit of humiliation and a second attempt at solving the problem.Homework is thus beneficial on multiple levels, and must not be banned for the sake of all students.[1]: http://www.sfgate.com...[2]: http://nces.ed.gov...[3]: http://tvoparents.tvo.org...[4]: http://today.duke.edu...[5]: http://hbr.org...[6]: http://everydaylife.globalpost.com...", "qid": 47, "docid": "5e2b575d-2019-04-18T16:32:42Z-00004-000", "score": 6.697999954223633}, {"content": "Title: Homework Content: I will be arguing that homework is not only beneficial but imperative for students success.

Well, I will elaborate this in my rebuttal, however, I said in moderate amounts. In moderate amounts, 1 small assignment a night due in two days can't be too stressful, can it?Now onto my argument. Homework enables the day to be shorter. My opponent claims that the day is too busy for the child. However, the day would be even longer without homework. Homework enables teachers to get through work that there isn't time for in class, and to finish off class work from that day. Without homework, school days would be much longer. What proof of that is there? you might say. However, one does not need proof. Logic serves the mind just as well.If my opponent's claims that \"there is too much homework\", just pause to think about what would happen if that homework is eliminated. How much work is done at home as homework? How many assignments, and school work is done at home? How much studying at home? Well, imagine if homework is taken away. Then how many hours would be added on the set school day? If we aren't going to be finishing schoolwork in class, and teachers can't set is at homework, we would need longer lessons. And what about those major assessments, or in high school, that huge coursework? A teacher can't set that as homework, since we're abolishing it, so it must be done in class. And classes are already full of work already, where would one find the time to do it? The answer, the school days must be elongated. So that student's \"already busy day\" would be even longer. Of course, you may say students will just do the work at home on their own. And they can do it on their own. But let's be honest with ourselves, how many of us actually do that? How many of us would finish of the work we did in class at home, if it wasn't set? The sad answer, not very many of us. We can't find the motivation, or work up the trouble to do it, if it wasn't mandatory or required.

[Source: http://kistoday.blogspot.com...In addition to normal school and after-school activities, this is overloading and counter-productive. Students are already struggling with the amount of sheer homework they have, they are already barely getting any hours of sleep nowadays. With the addition of a job, the students would be lucky to even obtain one hour of sleep, as I see it. After-school jobs would hinder the students' usual performance and possibly even stop the possibilities of building a ground for better jobs, as the student wouldn't work well with the insomnia, both in school and in their jobs.Helping financial management:COUNTER-PLANThere are financial management classes in school. The parents, when buying gifts along with them, giving them payments every month as a \"salary\", is enough for financial management. This is far more beneficial and moral than after-school jobs. The policy of giving students a \"payment\" for their chores makes the parents and their childrens' relationship. After-school jobs would be repetitive and not very helpful as noted above. Having parents or teachers lead their children when they have free time would be a much better plan than having students work in after-school jobs. Work experience is moot because when the students start out, they most definitely aren't going to work in the white-collar environment. Students are still students; they don't have the skills necessary for anything more than blue-collar. Very few students can actually have the ability to work in a white-collar environment to set themselves up. An environment in McDonald's is going to be very different from an environment in say, Northrop Grumman. While the boss may expect to you work all the 8 hours in McDonald's, maybe in Northrop Grumman you have to do more of the talking, discussing, and have break-times as well.

I think that saying students are suffering because of homework is pretty extreme. If you were to ask me, the people living on the streets, eating garbage, and begging for food and money, and who failed out of school because they never did homework assigned to them, are suffering. In four years of high school homework has never caused me to endure death, pain, or distress. Homework is a small price to pay to avoid ending up on the streets suffering. II. Not everything can be taught in the classroom You know the old saying \"practice makes perfect. \" Just like anything else, if you want to succeed in academics then you have to practice. How this practice comes about changes with different cultures and different areas. For example, in Japan students go to school for much longer than public schools keep students here in the States, so that students can get the practice they need while they are in school. We just do it different here by allowing students the time to study and practice on their own through homework. Homework is beneficial because it simulates real life situations and creates responsibility. Which brings me to my last point. III. Homework teaches time management skills. Throughout life you have to balance your time according to your wants with your needs. Its just like with money, you can't buy something you want until you have bought everything you need.

Homework confines our thinking and working abilities to only what is taught in school, whereas instead of homework, research work turns out to be more beneficial. 2.

I believe we should not have homework. Their are many reasons for and against this topic. I believe that children need to have time to be children. They can go to school and learn but they should have a break once in a while. However, students have homework piled onto them so much they work late into the night trying to finish it so they can keep their grade up. The dont get much sleep because their mind is racing , thinking about homework they maybe didnt get a chance to finish that they have to do in the morning or because they are just too stressed both at school and at home. If a child cannot learn what needs to be learned in a six hour day, we are expecting too much of a child. We are creating a jam-packed hurried day without a chance to play, reflect and interact. Adding hours to an already busy day is absurd. Older Children Are Even More Busy: So if younger students need a chance to play, the reality is that many older students are busy with extracurricular activities. Duke University\"s study (by Harris Cooper) concluded that homework does not increase achievement and it often decreases it instead. I spent some time looking at the \"studies\" regarding homework and they all point to a correlation rather than a causal relationship between homework and achievement. The bottom line is that the research is sketchy at best. Homework doesn\"t teach good study habits. It teaches kids to study, because they have to rather than need to. Similarly, homework doesn\"t help children become hard workers, because the work is not self-directed. Want to watch a child work hard and take ownership of learning? Watch a child build a bridge for fun. Let a child read a book for fun (without the bribery of fried dough) and see just how hard a kid will work when there is a meaningful goal. Hard work is a product of motivation. It is an internal drive. When we a parent steps in an makes a child work hard, the work ethic diminishes. In conclusion, I believe that students should not have homework because it isnt beneficial and it stresses students out tremendously. :)", "qid": 47, "docid": "1733c2bc-2019-04-18T13:51:19Z-00000-000", "score": 6.59630012512207}, {"content": "Title: Homework Content: Homework is beneficial because: =It makes students learn how to juggle their workload and time. =Pushes students to work hard. =Making sure students understand what they have learned so far. = Repeating is the mother of perfection. =Prevents someone from forgetting what they have learned. =students learn to de disciplined and balance the amount of homework and their time. =Makes students think.

Content: First, there are three arguments for why homework is excellent and ought to continue in modern schools. 1. Homework aids doer-learners. It is generally accepted that there are three types of learners: those who learn by hearing, those who learn by seeing, and those who learn by doing. While many are content to hear or see instruction of a given subject, some need to actually do it. Thus, homework is beneficial for this latter group because the instruction is learn through action. 2. Homework reinforces instruction. Although many would probably be thrilled to not have homework, the quality of the education received would certainly suffer if it was removed. Whether the homework is assigned reading, term papers, etc. , all of it is designed to reinforce the instruction in the students' minds. After all, those who do their homework are more academically successful than those who do not. I feel that this is a self-evident truth, but I'll leave it Pro to dissuade you. 3. Homework mirrors real-life demands. After high-school, there are mainly two paths for graduates to take: college or work. For both of these paths, assignments will be allocated and the professors/bosses will except to see them completed. Now, having done homework with deadlines before, graduates are used to these demands and are thus more likely to succeed. But remove homework and students will be unfamiliar with long-term assignments, deadlines, and the like. In short, homework helps to prepare graduates for real-life demands. I will now refute Pro's arguments: 1. \"Checking [homework] takes valuable class time. \" No, this is absolutely false. Instructors generally do not grade homework in class because it is a time for teaching, not evaluation. Instructors usually grade in their offices or homes and are paid (by salary) to do so. Class time is seldom, if ever, affected by grading homework. Pro's argument is ridiculous. 2. \"Kids cannot handle so much schoolwork with such a little attention span. \" Well, this is half-true. Kids do tend to have smaller attention spans compared to adults, but I would answer that the homework is tailored to their ability to perform. Here's what I mean: if a teacher knows that X student can only focus for Y time before pooping on the floor, then said teacher (assuming he/she is smart) will not assign more than X student can handle. Since I have family members who teach middle school, I can testify firsthand that the workload is intended to be manageable. What if it's not? Well, ideally, the kids and their parents complain and either the instructor or principal corrects the problem. Yes, some may refuse to reduce the workload, but that is rare and not a acceptable reason to abolish all homework everywhere. Homework is good, even if it's occasionally abused. 3. \"[Homework] takes away from family time. \" I find this argument ironic. How long is an average school day? About 6-8 hours. How long does daily homework take to accomplish? 1-2 hours at worst. You see, homework is not the main usurper of family time! Rather, it the length of schools days that's the real culprit. If a student is diligent, there still is ample time for familial interaction. Also, I find Pro's argument to be laughable simply because students generally avoid socializing with their families. Many would rather play Minecraft, Call of Duty, etc. than sit around the table exchanging stories. So, to wrap up, I have presented three reasons for why homework is good and have attempted to disprove Pro's arguments.

This debate will hopefully enlighten readers on a topic that they probably, like me, have not really considered deeply before. In this round I\u2019ll lay out what I see as the purpose and value of recess, and from there argue why activities ought not to be banned, like homework. Recess \u2013 Why do we have it? What is it\u2019s value? Students are legally required to attend school. [1] School is society\u2019s institution for teaching. What a school ought to try and achieve is subjective to a point, but I\u2019m sure Con will agree that we\u2019re aiming to produce capable, moral citizens for society. To this end, we have recess. The consumption of food is beneficial for educational purposes as energy is replenished, nutritional requirements are satisfied etc. Without eating, drinking and the like school performance would drop. Of course, we don\u2019t just have a 15 minute lunch, we have recess. Recess is a tool that is effective at fostering social interaction, developing friendships and the like; building friendships is not just \u2018fun\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s part of developing capable citizens who know how to interact properly and understand the social consequences of their actions. Recess can also be used to increase fitness (as Con will likely argue), and as I will argue, lighten the homework load at home (meaning, more time with family) , allow development of hobbies, say chess, and so forth. These are crucial benefits. Obviously though Con will question why these other things ought to be allowed. He himself advocates these things potentially in the form of a second recess. That\u2019s outside this debate\u2019s scope \u2013 recess is a set amount of time, and the structure fairly rigid. As an aside though, it is a fascinating issue as to what amount of time should be allowed for recess \u2013 in Sendai, Japan approximately 15% of the day is spent in recess, with every lesson followed by a 10 or 15 minute recess. In Chicago children had 5% of the day allocated to recess. [2] I would strongly recommend the article for anybody interested on the subject, and other educational matters. The point though is that we\u2019re working with a set amount of time for recess, so to mandate certain activities is to come at the expense of recess. This brings up a poignant point \u2013 why is recess more effective than forced instruction for some things? Freedom Above I outlined the benefits of recess \u2013 Social interaction, friendships are formed etc. Undoubtedly, this can occur in the classroom, but it\u2019s not as common, nor the primary purpose. To be sure, educational benefits can be derived from efficient teamwork derived from friendship, but this is not normally the case. There\u2019s a rigid set of rules. Recess is an escape from that \u2013 it\u2019s a block of free time. Con sees an idyllic situation where \u2018play\u2019 occurs and is more fun than fitness classes and the like. Of course \u2018play\u2019 is generally more fun \u2013 you get eagerness to participate in the activity, competitive and capable players etc. This fosters positive relationships. Freedom, the ability to do this and choose things willingly is critical to this. Con\u2019s plan is to make this idyllic situation mandatory, which is self-defeating. The reason this situations exists is because people choose to use their free time effectively. By eliminating that choice we revert back to a model of forced choices, forced instruction. The value of recess is in being a break from educational constraints, not simply being another type of constraint. Is the above all bluff and bluster? No. Force those who\u2019d rather do other things to participate in a game and they will sour it \u2013 they won\u2019t try hard, they\u2019ll make a space congestive etc. These people will also more likely become cynical and frustrated. These people would do much better to choose their own activity, find others who like that activity, and form strong social bonds with these people. These bonds are stronger, and more positive, than those formed by shared dislike of forced physical activity. To give an example, myself and a friend of mine originally met in a day set aside for ranking chess teams. This day ran into lunch (more later on the fact that many extracurricular activities hold meetings during recess). Since that day I\u2019ve spent many, many hours in the library at lunch playing chess with my friend. Our work made our school\u2019s chess team get it\u2019s best result in 50 years, formed social relationships between various years via their interest in chess and so forth. However, our friendship began to extend beyond chess and into other activities \u2013 we\u2019re now both active members on this site. This would not have happened had we been doing forced physical activity \u2013 we are in different years and would not have associated originally under Con\u2019s proposal. Is my friend unfit? No, he\u2019s the second fastest medium distance runner in his grade, the best swimmer etc. Am I unfit? No. I\u2019m the 4th fastest sprinter in my year, one of the best runners and so forth. A free environment makes scenarios like the above occur. Banning activities like homework is the start of a slippery slope to a restrictive environment. Recess is beneficial because it\u2019s free time. Opportunity Cost Homework not done at one point is merely homework delayed for later. If a student believes it\u2019s more productive to do homework at school then he should. If the student derives more happiness at home than at school then is it the school\u2019s place to force the student to pursue the course of action which results in less happiness? The answer is no. Enforcement It\u2019s a rather difficult thing to stop a student doing his homework during recess \u2013 the typical punishments are rather useless. Detention? The student will continue with his homework then. Force him to accompany the supervising teacher? That won\u2019t accomplish any of Con\u2019s goals, and will just force the student to do homework later, taking away from time with their family. Without a model of enforcing the proposed policy it\u2019s pointless to disallow homework \u2013 it\u2019s a mere waste of resources to prevent people doing homework. Physical Activity I\u2019ve touched on this earlier, but why is physical activity better at school? My PE classes this year have not improved my fitness. School sport has done so for me, but that\u2019s because I chose one of the few sports that actually does something at school. My point? One can push oneself quite hard at home, yet lounge at school, but homework is forced to take away from home time (as an aside, I\u2019m also doing a debate about putting homework in school time and lengthening the school day which would render this debate moot...) . Granted the pressure of peers is perhaps the very best motivator to push oneself, but this already occurs. People are pushing themself given freedom to do so. The people doing homework at lunch, wasting time on frivolities (homework is not one of these things) are unlikely to accept the challenge of their peers head on. Conclusion Recess works so well because it\u2019s free time that isn\u2019t geared towards any specific activity. Con\u2019s proposal eats away at this strength. Also, there is the opportunity cost related with doing homework at home. Physical fitness, the very pillar of Con\u2019s case, also falls under this to a point. Finally, the logistics of enforcing such a policy are problematic to say the least. I look forward to Con\u2019s arguments.

Content: Students are not meant to \"learn\" from homework. Homework is assigned to students to review a topic they've already learned previous to the assignment, and those students are expected to complete the assignment or review of what they've learned. This is only beneficial to a student, because homework is usually a sufficient study tool, mostly in preparation for various quizzes or tests. A study on this topic was actually conducted at East Carolina University by Department of Economics Professor, Dr. Nick Rupp. (Statistics on this study can be found at: https://blog.ecu.edu...) Dr. Rupp had separated the students in his class into two groups, each decided by a coin flip. One group was assigned a specific homework assignment which would count for 10% of their upcoming test grade, and the other group was assigned the same assignment but it was completely optional and had no score effect on the test. In conclusion of this test, Dr. Rupp noted that the group of students required to do the homework had \"performed a half-letter grade better, on average...\" Another notable point to his conclusion was that the majority of the group of students in the group required to do the homework had scored B's on the test, while the majority of students in the group with the optional homework had students with the majority of C grades. Dr. Rupp did indeed acknowledge that students in both groups had received grades of A's, but the major differences were in the B's and C's group. Another study conducted by the Associated Press in January of 2006 found that about 57% of parents thought their children had been assigned enough homework, another 23% of parents thought their students were given too little homework, and the final 19% had thought that it was too much. This shows that 81% of parents either agree with the amount of homework their child receives, or requested more homework for their students. A third study conducted by MetLife in 2007 concluded that 87% of parents interviewed had said that homework had given them an opportunity to talk with and bond with their children. In the same study conducted, 78% of parents interviewed had said that homework did not interfere with family time together, and 71% of parents interviewed had said that homework was not a major source of stress in their child. (Statistics for these studies are found at: http://www.sedl.org...) In a series of 35 studies, 77% of these studies had shown a positive correlation between a student's homework completion and academic achievement. This correlation is seen mostly in Junior High and High School students, and is hard to prove either way with Elementary School students. The National PTA and the NEA have created a parent guide named: \"Helping Your Child Get the Most Out of Homework\". This guide states that \"Most educators agree that for children in grades K-2, homework is more effective when it does not exceed 10-20 minutes each day; older children, in grades 3-6, can handle 30-60 minutes each day; in junior and senior high, the amount will vary by subject...\" In the same study, the learning of a student in grades 3-6 does not diminish from homework unless it exceeds approximately 90 minutes. The learning of high school students is not diminished by homework until it reaches between 90-150 minutes. (These facts were gathered from: https://today.duke.edu...) These are just a couple of examples paired with their sources of correlations between homework and academic achievement. With multiple studies coming to this conclusion of the correlation, and a study showing that parents feel that the amount of homework their child receives is adequate, or too little. That same study also shows that parents do not feel that homework violates family time. With the evidence coming from these studies, it proves that there is almost certainly a positive correlation between time spent on homework and academic achievement. Therefore, I use this to support the negation (Con) case of this argument, stating firmly that homework should indeed be given to students. I'm supporting this side of the argument using academic achievement, family (specifically parent) interviews, and previous experiences with homework, as well as various studies on the topic.

Everyone needs to develop responsibility and skills in personal organization, deadlines, being able to research, etc. If students are always \"spoon-fed\" topics at school they will never develop study skills and self-discipline for the future. A gradual increase in homework responsibilities over the years allows these skills to develop. Homework is a way for you to practice what you are learning. If you didn't have homework, you would have to stay in school until you finished your practice, and since everyone works at different rates, you'd be there until the slowest people finally caught on. Also the best way to learn something is to recall it over and over again. If you learn something in class, and then do homework at home, you'll have a better chance of actually getting the knowledge. Homework serves a valuable purpose in education. Not only does it allow students to practice what was taught in class, thereby solidifying concepts, but most importantly it teaches responsibility. Best given as a few target exercises rather than pages and pages of mindless drill, homework is a way of teaching students responsibility when the teacher is not there to \"make them learn\".People learn by doing. No matter how many times you read about something or have something explained to you until you practice the skill on your own you do not truly possess that skill. A skill, which learning any subject is, is attained in the following way: Watch someone else do it Have someone else help you do it Do it yourself Until you master the last you do not have the skill. That is where the homework part comes in homework encourages students to undertake independent learning which they will be required to do when they get to University. Many people argue that schools spoon-feed their students, which makes them completely unprepared for what awaits them at higher education when all research and further reading must be done on the student\"s own time. By setting homework in the form of projects, students will be able to learn on their own and develop skills that will serve them well in later life. It also helps to teach the students responsibility and time management skills, seeing as the teacher is not there to make them learn. Also, a lot of students prefer to learn on their own and teach themselves, rather than having a teacher lecture them. Homework encourages children to do this and may also help them to revise it more thoroughly. Whatever students have learnt in the classroom can then be reinforced and solidified by completing homework tasks. Homework can also be beneficial for the teacher as when they collect homework in to mark it, it gives them a good idea of how much their students understand what is being taught. It gives kids responsibilities and discipline it also keeps them out of trouble as well as giving parents alone time it helps kids practice what they learnt in class lets just it lets teachers to have more time to explain the topic and not worrying about the work that should be done in class because it can be done for homework. Homework plays an important role in a student's education. It fosters independent learning, it develops one's study habits and it reinforces learning. How can students complain about not having not enough recreation time? A student could create some time within 24 hours for their recreation or relaxing. Homework can also be proof that a student is up to date with their curriculum. It helps memorise information and other work. If a student attends class and then goes home free of homework, what he previously learned in class that day could have been forgotten, so homework will then bring that knowledge keep it memorised.", "qid": 47, "docid": "abf51816-2019-04-18T15:38:53Z-00002-000", "score": 6.50439977645874}, {"content": "Title: Reduce homework, lengthen schooltime Content: To clear up 2 uncertainties from R1, teaching will be as normal from 9-5 as per the model outline.

However, I\u2019ll say that all students go from 9-5. However, the amount of free time would be greater for younger students because the homework reduction associated with increased school time does not exist for them; this time is transferred to free time. Let\u2019s not get bogged down on logistics though if possible. Let\u2019s go to arguments. Massed vs. Spaced PresentationOne of education\u2019s main goals is for students to retain what they learn at school \u2013 we ought to prefer systems which result in greater retention of knowledge as it\u2019s a goal for education. For instance, a good test score due to cramming, with the student later forgetting such knowledge is sub-optimal vs. a lower test score yet greater memory retention. How does this relate to the resolution? Being in school encourages spaced presentation, which results in better memory retention. This is all about the \u2018spacing effect\u2019 [1]. This effect details how humans more easily learn / remember things when studied a few times over a longer period of time (spaced presentation) as opposed to repeated study in a shorter timespan (massed presentation). However, and this is key - \"the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals; that is, at short retention intervals, massed presentation lead to better memory performance than spaced presentations\" . SeeGreene, R. L. (1989). Spacing effects in memory: Evidence for a two-process account. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15(3), 371-377. School via timetabling tends to promote spaced presentation \u2013 lessons are not put back to back to back for the same subject. However, many students might do a mass of homework for a subject in one go because a) Their schedule promotes that, b) They remember as they go (ie. Ex 1. Is a prerequisite for Ex 2. And so remembering Ex 1 helps with Ex 2) along with other reasons. Essentially, students will tend to group together clumps of related homework and do them in go, which is more a form of massed presentation than spaced presentation. Ergo, school, by encouraging spaced presentation under the proposed model through putting \u2018homework\u2019 in class time in effect, is preferable. Homework vs. InstructionOn homework briefly:Much homework is sub-optimal, which can't be helped. Some homework is good but a student doesn't realise it. Some homework is simply beneficial. The issue in evaluating the value of homework is what students do outside of school - for some capable people homework is quite the restriction; many are just wasting their youth on trivialities; homework is good, no matter it's sub-optimal state, for these people. Textbooks are instructional to a point. However, a teacher\u2019s guidance at the ready + a textbook is superior. If a student doesn\u2019t understand their textbook\u2019s example (say, in maths) when doing an exercise (the type of homework being restricted) then they will perform sub-optimally (ie. Very short answers to written questions), waste an inordinate amount of time doing the exercise (vs. doing the exercise then something else productive) or they\u2019ll copy the answers. Some of those are diametrically opposite, but that reflects the student\u2019s beliefs being different. When a student is at school they will seek guidance from the teacher when stuck, eliminating time wastage (\u2018inordinate\u2019). They will have greater difficulty copying answers due to teacher supervision. They will be pushed to perform optimally not just by the teacher, but by their peers \u2013 iron sharpens iron is just as true in education. CostStreamlining students and workers to the same timetable reduces things like day care costs somewhat, debases tuition costs (private tutoring that is) and ensures maximal use of public transport on a wider basis (many buses and trains around school time are less cramped than during peak hours) . More importantly though, parents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home. Reduction in general mischiefIt\u2019s a fact \u2013 youth disproportionately commit crimes. \u201cA comparison of the proportion of total offenders who were aged 10\u201324 in 2009\u201310 (48%) with the proportion of the general population who were aged 10\u201324 in Australia as at December 2009 (23%), clearly shows the higher proportion of young people in the offender population (graph S13.1). \u201d [2] What do youth have that adults have? A disproportionate amount of unallocated free time, which combined with various rebellious impulses and hormones results in crimes being committed. See the graph in the link for a visual explanation of the aforementioned. A solid school environment and a reduction in this poorly utilised free time (crime is a poor use of time with regards to the collective) will reduce crime. Furthermore, additional schooling increases the ability to get messages out to avoid drugs and the like. Government messages have been effective at reducing drug use, such as smoking [3] [4]. Education is cited as one of the main reasons for this decline in smoking. If we can combat smoking then a more effective message through a safe, controlled environment like school will also reduce illicit drug use, and legal, yet harmful drug use. Longer school hours can help achieve this through better education. Working mindset / Lack of agrarian workforce currentlyWhy did the US and many other countries originally adopt a 9-3 style of schooling? Why did the, now rather ludicrous, idea of summer vacation eventuate in the US? The reason that this occurred was that the US was formerly an agrarian society \u2013 children of agrarian society left school to go work in the field at home. Now we have no such demand on our time other than school. Let me quote YYW from the second link last round:\u201cChildren must be taught the importance of self discipline, the necessity of a strong work ethic and the importance of maximized productivity from birth. I'm not saying that kids should be pushed into the fields or factories, but rather suggesting that all the time wasted in the summer months is the opportunity cost of greater preparation for college, for grad school, for work and for life. \u201dGranted, this debate isn\u2019t about summer vacation, but why not have children work as their parents do? It instills the values of work, the value of free time, presents social mischief (see earlier) and gives children and teenagers a greater appreciation of their parents duties and workload, which increases familial harmony. This mindset in beneficial for future productivity \u2013 another goal of education. ConclusionEncouraging spaced presentation, increasing available instructional assistance, reducing cost, a reduction in crime and social mischief, the development of a working mindset and familial harmony are all good reasons to extend the school day. I eagerly await my opponent\u2019s response.

(In secondary school) Content: Like you I am also in year 10, going into year 11, but I live in Scotland so it's S3 going into S4. So here in Scotland the work in School and the work at home is very different. School work is usually more for learning, so most of the lesson the teacher is talking to the class, explaining concepts, then for maybe 15 minutes at the end the class would put what they have learnt into practice. Homework is not for learning, it is for practicing, this allows for the student to fully practice and understand what they have learnt in class so that the next time they go to class they can move on and actually use the teachers expertise and spend their in-class time on learning, not on revision. Now onto countering some of the points you made: Firstly \"it is stressful\". Well let's imagine that you go through school with no stress, when you get a job or go to college/uni you all of a sudden have to meet strict deadline, all very stressful. My point is exposure to stress is not necessarily a bad thing, sure too much of it can be harmful, but the stress caused by homework can actually help you learn to deal with stress before you are put into a real life situation where people are dependent on you (which is much more stressful). You then said \"it takes away from free time\". What is more important? Understanding and getting better at school work or playing Call of Duty. For me, along with many others, the answer is the former. School in general takes away from free time, but that's no reason not to attend school. Another point you mentioned was to do with IQ. As far as I know IQ is something that is fixed from birth, therefore of course homework isn't going to affect it, nothing will. And finally (because it would take me too long to counter everything) you said \"It can negatively affect performance\". I believe it could go either way - if you are good at managing your time efficiently then I believe it will have a very positive impact on your knowledge and understanding. Reading your closing paragraph I believe we have found a middle ground - I have no respect for teachers who give meaningless homework, I completely agree that meaningless, unmarked homework is a waste of time. Luckily for me I rarely get issued such homework (when I do, it is usually from a substitute teacher). However I believe that homework when issued effectively and marked afterwards is very beneficial for students.", "qid": 47, "docid": "a61ca9af-2019-04-18T14:30:38Z-00001-000", "score": 6.4096999168396}, {"content": "Title: Ban Homework!

Pressure can push people to do better, and that includes performance on tests. As proof, Let us look at some studies. \"The results of such studies suggest that homework can improve students\u2019 scores on the class tests that come at the end of a topic\" http://www.sedl.org... Another important note is that \"However, 35 less rigorous (correlational) studies suggest little or no relationship between homework and achievement for elementary school students.\" http://www.sedl.org... It is somewhat difficult to prove that homework is the cause of lower test scores. Plus, this seems to vary from individual to individual. This explains why studies show different results. 2nd Assertion: There are many factors that cause stress and depression. Homework alone is not the reason. Also, stress can be healthy as well and is not all bad. \u201cStress doesn't just motivate us to get things done. Short bouts of it may actually boost the immune system and protect against one type of cancer, according to researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine, who were able to show the effects using stressed out laboratory mice.\u201d http://phys.org... 3rd Assertion: There are many factors that cause students to drop out. Some have family issues. Some are struggling with bullying, and others are struggling with their health or peer pressure. If students get too much homework, it is a bad thing. Since we are arguing about homework overall, one cannot say that homework is bad. Too much homework is bad, but moderation is key. Too much homework is bad, but that does not mean all homework is bad. 4h Assertion: Just as homework can take away from extra-curricular activities, those activities can take away from homework. Homework, as long as it is not just busywork, can serve as great review. Homework can also be used to further understand the material. Many students need exposure in the classroom as well as at home. Many times, students understand the material at school, but need to be exposed at home as well in order to reinforce this exposure and contribute to better comprehension. Having to juggle activities, family, and homework is a good life lesson. When students enter the \"real world,\" they have to learn to juggle many things in their life. Thus, keeping homework and other activities aids in this very important ability to juggle what life throws at people. 5th Assertion: Cheating happens in life overall.

I hope for an intelligent, interesting debate. Now, to clarify some matters:The American and Australian education systems differ (clearly more than originally envisaged) , but the core idea is the same - the time spent doing homework is reduced; this is spent at school. On specifics:Proposed school day: 9-5, 80 minutes of this are a break in effect; how these 80 minutes operate is clearly outlined in R1. Current school day (in Australia): About 9-3 with 60 minutes break; schools may operate say 9-3:10 as mine does, but the minutae is not our concern.Con, treat this like an extension from 8-3 to 8-4. However, part of the proposal is 9-5 because it matches up with the typical workers day. I will have to rely on assumptions like US students receiving less homework on a daily basis (more time at school daily) and a working day being 9-5 in the US.I apologise for confusion - education systems are different. To arguments; they apply to nearly any similar extension.Con, if problems are still present let's sort it out in the comments, not the debate.Massed vs. Spaced PresentationOne of education\u2019s main goals is for students to retain what they learn at school \u2013 we ought to prefer systems which result in greater retention of knowledge as it\u2019s a goal for education. A good test score due to cramming, with the student later forgetting such knowledge is sub-optimal vs. a lower test score yet greater memory retention.How does this relate to the resolution? Being in school encourages spaced presentation, which results in better memory retention.This is all about the \u2018spacing effect\u2019 [1]. This effect details how humans more easily learn / remember things when studied a few times over a longer period of time (spaced presentation) as opposed to repeated study in a shorter timespan (massed presentation). However, and this is key - \"the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals; that is, at short retention intervals, massed presentation lead to better memory performance than spaced presentations\" . SeeGreene, R.L. (1989). Spacing effects in memory: Evidence for a two-process account. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15(3), 371-377.School via timetabling tends to promote spaced presentation \u2013 lessons are not put back to back to back for the same subject. However, many students might do a mass of homework for a subject in one go because a) Their schedule promotes that, b) They remember as they go (ie. Ex 1. Is a prerequisite for Ex 2. And so remembering Ex 1 helps with Ex 2) along with other reasons. Essentially, students will tend to group together clumps of related homework and do them in go, which is more a form of massed presentation than spaced presentation. Ergo, school, by encouraging spaced presentation under the proposed model through putting \u2018homework\u2019 in class time in effect, is preferable.Homework vs. InstructionOn homework briefly:Much homework is sub-optimal, which can't be helped. Some homework is good but a student doesn't realise it. Some homework is simply beneficial. The issue in evaluating the value of homework is what students do outside of school - for some capable people homework is restrictive; many are just wasting their youth on trivialities; homework is good, no matter it's sub-optimal state, for these people.Textbooks are instructional to a point. However, a teacher\u2019s guidance + a textbook is superior. If a student doesn\u2019t understand their textbook\u2019s example (say, maths) when doing an exercise (the type of homework being restricted) then they will perform sub-optimally (ie. Very short answers to written questions), waste an inordinate amount of time doing the exercise (vs. doing the exercise then something else productive) or they\u2019ll copy the answers. Some of those are diametrically opposite, but that reflects the student\u2019s beliefs being different. A student at school will seek guidance from a teacher when stuck, eliminating time wastage (\u2018inordinate\u2019). They will have greater difficulty copying answers due to teacher supervision. They will be pushed to perform optimally not just by the teacher, but by peers \u2013 iron sharpens iron is just as true in education.CostStreamlining students and workers to the same timetable reduces things like day care costs somewhat, debases tuition costs (private tutoring that is) and ensures maximal use of public transport on a wider basis (many buses and trains around school time are less cramped than during peak hours) . More importantly though, parents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home.Reduction in general mischiefIt\u2019s a fact \u2013 youth disproportionately commit crimes. \u201cA comparison of the proportion of total offenders who were aged 10\u201324 in 2009\u201310 (48%) with the proportion of the general population who were aged 10\u201324 in Australia as at December 2009 (23%), clearly shows the higher proportion of young people in the offender population (graph S13.1).\u201d [2] What do youth have that adults have? A disproportionate amount of unallocated free time, which combined with various rebellious impulses and hormones results in crimes being committed. See the graph in the link for a visual explanation of the aforementioned.A solid school environment and a reduction in this poorly utilised free time (crime is a poor use of time with regards to the collective) will reduce crime.

Education is cited as one of the main reasons for this decline in smoking. If we can combat smoking then a more effective message through a safe, controlled environment like school will also reduce illicit drug use, and legal, yet harmful drug use. Longer school hours can help achieve this through better education.Working mindset / Lack of agrarian workforce currentlyWhy did the US and many other countries originally adopt a 9-3 style of schooling? Why did the, now rather ludicrous, idea of summer vacation eventuate in the US? The reason that this occurred was that the US was formerly an agrarian society \u2013 children of agrarian society left school to go work in the field at home. Now we have no such demand on our time other than school. Let me quote YYW from the second link last round:\u201cChildren must be taught the importance of self discipline, the necessity of a strong work ethic and the importance of maximized productivity from birth.

In this last round I\u2019ll attempt to summarise my case, while also conducting rebuttals. Let\u2019s not mince words though; to arguments. School / Work Life The proposal clearly adds 120 minutes to the school day. Con says \u201c40 minutes lunch, 20 minutes ECA, and 40 minutes others\u201d (that\u2019s 100...) . This is incorrect. There\u2019s 20 extra minutes of break implemented + 100 minutes of lessons; the existing 60 minutes of lunch / recess are reworked. Con\u2019s math is incorrect here; see R1. On classes, free time is elected. Remember, assuming the same amount of homework, the model allows students to have 20 minutes more free time that doesn\u2019t have to be spent in school or doing homework as detailed in R3. That assists in freeing up time for students to work! Con\u2019s argues that students text in class. Guess what? There are more distractions in the household to distract one from schoolwork \u2013 TV, Internet etc. Plus, no supervising authority. Children spend more time watching TV than learning in school! [1] A child, on average, watches 1480 minutes of TV a week. Tell me there\u2019s no time wasting there. That far outweighs time wastage by texting. \u201cThe average person spends about half of their free time (about 2.8 hours a day to be exact) watching TV\u201d [2]School is not the fear here. Sleep deprivation is not a point for Con\u2019s case unless available free time outside school decreases. My model increases that time by 20 minutes. Hence, sleep deprivation is reduced under my model. I concur with Con\u2019s experience; I have worked as well. Anyway, the total time spent on school related work can be decreased by 20 minutes, so, over the entire week, the available time to work is increased. Granted, the time on any individual day may be somewhat reduced, but given homework... the effects of sleep deprivation kick in. Of course, considering Muted is familiar with a 7:30-6:00pm secondary system (as per his R3 intro) I find it rather ironic that he\u2019s attacking my model for eliminating time to work. Memory Retention I\u2019ve already talked in depth about how school timetabling forces spaced presentation to occur which is beneficial. Con doesn\u2019t deny this. His counter is that technology \u2018can \u2019 induce the spacing effect, by voluntary free will of course. Also, on this choice I demonstrated in R3 that students have an incentive to do homework in clumps as massed presentation will assist them as they continue working! In essence, there are good reasons to suggest that students will do massed presentation at home. Furthermore, as my source indicated last round, the DET in NSW has rolled out laptops to all year 9 students in public schools. Technology is a wash between models. However, my model increases teacher instruction and all it\u2019s associated benefits. More later. Con\u2019s next states that work is more akin to work than school is. Obviously I agree, but most time outside school isn\u2019t spent on work! Most youth don\u2019t even work at all; 69.3%[3] Many aren\u2019t of age. The question is then whether school is more akin to work than the home environment. It is, as demonstrated previously, which as per the encoding specificity principle is beneficial for memory retention. Of course, Con hasn\u2019t demonstrated how more time is available for work in the first place, so his counter is moot. (see above point) I\u2019ve demonstrated how state and context dependent cues occur more frequently under my model. On productivity at home, I counter Con\u2019s study. In a survey of over 5000 workers it was found that 17% of telecommuters worked less than an hour a hour, and 37-40% (see the sources) stated they were more productive at the office vs. 29% reporting more work being done at home. [4] [5] This survey was conducted by the largest online employment agency in the USA, CareerBuilder. Finally, Con\u2019s study refers to workers who must need money to survive. Children tend to lack discipline and don\u2019t have the need for money to pay the rent. Their lack of incentive to work at home vis-a-vis distractions, limits the impact of Con\u2019s study. Cost / Teacher Workload I withdraw my point on debasing private tutoring costs; the point is irrelevant, as Con notes. Con fails to counter my points about the streamlining of public transport through more efficient use of transport \u2013 students + workers are all catching the same transport, reducing inefficiencies and meaning buses are more likely to run for remote areas (saving students time walking home / parents having to pick them up, leading to longer working hours for parents) and the associated benefits, as well as reduced daycare costs for parents. The State and parents benefit. Those are un-countered points. Teachers aren\u2019t working longer \u2013 the extended school day is a substitute for marking homework \u2013 95 minutes a day are spent on things other than instruction, as Con noted in R2. In fact, through the spacing effect and better memory retention teachers can spend less time re-explaining things as students remember better. Net time save. Social Mischief Youth commit a disproportionate amount of crime (see R2). Why? A disproportionate amount of free time and hormones at work. A school environment has been effective in lowering harmful drug use (see R2). Furthermore, if students were to commit crimes when they should be doing homework then moving them into school increases the chance they\u2019ll do the homework vs. the distractions of unallocated time. Authority and supervision, both found in schools, deter crime. Furthermore, homework is known to causes familial discord (read: arguments in the home), typically in about 1/3 of families. [6] [7] In fact: \u201cAs a solution, the report suggests that \"homework clubs\", taking place after school, would be a successful way of getting the benefit of homework, without risking the disagreements associated with homework at home.\u201d [7] Does that sound like my proposal of moving homework into schooltime? I think so. Working Mindset / Lack of Agrarian Workforce I\u2019ve discussed timing in school and work life. However, as stressed there, so much free time is wasted by youth. Bringing students to school instills a work ethic, reduces social discord and increases familial harmony (see social mischief), as opposed to time wastage at home. Now not everybody wastes free time, but many youth do waste time; see statistics from earlier. Teacher Instruction Con can\u2019t counter the benefits of actual teacher instruction. A student at school will seek guidance from a teacher when stuck on homework, eliminating time wastage through being unsure on how to proceed on a question. They will have greater difficulty copying answers due to teacher supervision. They will be pushed to perform optimally not just by the teacher, but by peers \u2013 iron sharpens iron. Conclusion More free time, better memory retention, cost savings, lessened social mischief, just to name a few benefits. Readers, you know the complete case I\u2019ve laid out. I hope you\u2019ll agree that we ought to at least trial this model, if not implement it on a larger scale. I urge you to reread parts if need be. Readers, please vote based on this debate alone; this is an issue that I wish preconceptions not to bias. I thank you for your attention throughout. Finally, my thanks to Muted for a fierce, spirited debate throughout. I\u2019m sure we both learnt a fair bit throughout the debate!

I hope for an intelligent, interesting debate. By virtue of his brief R1, I presume he understands the resolution in full.Massed vs. Spaced PresentationOne of education\u2019s main goals is for students to retain what they learn at school \u2013 we ought to prefer systems which result in greater retention of knowledge as it\u2019s a goal for education. A good test score due to cramming, with the student later forgetting such knowledge is sub-optimal vs. a lower test score yet greater memory retention.How does this relate to the resolution? Being in school encourages spaced presentation, which results in better memory retention.This is all about the \u2018spacing effect\u2019 [1]. This effect details how humans more easily learn / remember things when studied a few times over a longer period of time (spaced presentation) as opposed to repeated study in a shorter timespan (massed presentation). However, and this is key - \"the benefit of spaced presentations does not appear at short retention intervals; that is, at short retention intervals, massed presentation lead to better memory performance than spaced presentations\" . SeeGreene, R.L. (1989). Spacing effects in memory: Evidence for a two-process account. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 15(3), 371-377.School via timetabling tends to promote spaced presentation \u2013 lessons are not put back to back to back for the same subject. However, many students might do a mass of homework for a subject in one go because a) Their schedule promotes that, b) They remember as they go (ie. Ex 1. Is a prerequisite for Ex 2. And so remembering Ex 1 helps with Ex 2) along with other reasons. Essentially, students will tend to group together clumps of related homework and do them in go, which is more a form of massed presentation than spaced presentation. Ergo, school, by encouraging spaced presentation under the proposed model through putting \u2018homework\u2019 in class time in effect, is preferable. But it doesn\u2019t end there for memory retention. I recently read Memory by Jonathan K. Foster (first published 2009), one of OUP\u2019s fascination very short introductions. To quote one part: \u201cOther things being equal, we tend to remember information better if we are in a similar physical context and emotional state at the time we wish to retrieve information as we were in at the time we were exposed to that information.\u201d School is more akin to work than the home environment, so as per a more similar physical context we remember better. This is specified in the encoding specificity principle. Also, the emotional state at school is more constant than at home, more like work. This again promotes better memory retention as the retrieval cue matches memories better. This sort of logic strongly explains why we can\u2019t remember dreams \u2013 the physical context is different, our emotional state different and our physiological state are also different. Homework vs. InstructionOn homework briefly:Much homework is sub-optimal, which can't be helped. Some homework is good but a student doesn't realise it. Some homework is simply beneficial. The issue in evaluating the value of homework is what students do outside of school - for some capable people homework is restrictive; many are just wasting their youth on trivialities; homework is good, no matter it's sub-optimal state, for these people.Textbooks are instructional to a point. However, a teacher\u2019s guidance + a textbook is superior. If a student doesn\u2019t understand their textbook\u2019s example (say, maths) when doing an exercise (the type of homework being restricted) then they will perform sub-optimally (ie. Very short answers to written questions), waste an inordinate amount of time doing the exercise (vs. doing the exercise then something else productive) or they\u2019ll copy the answers. Some of those are diametrically opposite, but that reflects the student\u2019s beliefs being different. A student at school will seek guidance from a teacher when stuck, eliminating time wastage (\u2018inordinate\u2019). They will have greater difficulty copying answers due to teacher supervision. They will be pushed to perform optimally not just by the teacher, but by peers \u2013 iron sharpens iron is just as true in education.CostStreamlining students and workers to the same timetable reduces things like day care costs somewhat, debases tuition costs (private tutoring that is) and ensures maximal use of public transport on a wider basis (many buses and trains around school time are less cramped than during peak hours) . More importantly though, parents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home.Reduction in general mischiefIt\u2019s a fact \u2013 youth disproportionately commit crimes. \u201cA comparison of the proportion of total offenders who were aged 10\u201324 in 2009\u201310 (48%) with the proportion of the general population who were aged 10\u201324 in Australia as at December 2009 (23%), clearly shows the higher proportion of young people in the offender population (graph S13.1).\u201d [2] What do youth have that adults have? A disproportionate amount of unallocated free time, which combined with various rebellious impulses and hormones results in crimes being committed. See the graph in the link for a visual explanation of the aforementioned.A solid school environment and a reduction in this poorly utilised free time (crime is a poor use of time with regards to the collective) will reduce crime. Furthermore, additional schooling increases the ability to get messages out to avoid drugs and the like. Government messages have been effective at reducing drug use, such as smoking [3] [4]. Education is cited as one of the main reasons for this decline in smoking. If we can combat smoking then a more effective message through a safe, controlled environment like school will also reduce illicit drug use, and legal, yet harmful drug use. Longer school hours can help achieve this through better education.Working mindset / Lack of agrarian workforce currentlyWhy did the US and many other countries originally adopt a 9-3 style of schooling? Why did the, now rather ludicrous, idea of summer vacation eventuate in the US? The reason that this occurred was that the US was formerly an agrarian society \u2013 children of agrarian society left school to go work in the field at home. Now we have no such demand on our time other than school. Let me quote YYW from the second link last round:\u201cChildren must be taught the importance of self discipline, the necessity of a strong work ethic and the importance of maximized productivity from birth. I'm not saying that kids should be pushed into the fields or factories, but rather suggesting that all the time wasted in the summer months is the opportunity cost of greater preparation for college, for grad school, for work and for life.\u201dNow, this debate isn\u2019t about summer vacation, but why not have children work as their parents do? It instills the values of work, the value of free time, presents social mischief (see earlier) and gives children and teenagers a greater appreciation of their parents duties and workload, which increases familial harmony. This mindset in beneficial for future productivity \u2013 another goal of education. ConclusionEncouraging spaced presentation, increasing available instructional assistance, reducing cost, a reduction in crime and social mischief, the development of a working mindset and familial harmony are all good reasons to extend the school day.I eagerly await my opponent\u2019s response.Sources1- http://en.wikipedia.org...2- http://www.abs.gov.au...3- http://www.cancercouncil.com.au...4- http://www.tobaccoinaustralia.org.au...", "qid": 47, "docid": "6b281711-2019-04-18T17:59:59Z-00005-000", "score": 6.295000076293945}, {"content": "Title: Homework is beneficial for school students Content: I am not just talking about brain efficiency.

Although i admit that too much homework is bad and that homework doesn't mean student achievement. Homework does in fact help someone consolidate information. I support 1-2 hours of home work because I feel that it is beneficial to that extent. futile-pointless I will show why homework is not pointless first i will negate my opponents main argument: \"\"study for a plethora of tests and quizzes, play sports, get involved in the community, eat food with nutritional value, and get an adequate amount of sleep, all in one day?\"\" I am a student athlete, i am also an A student as well as being actively involved in my church and other clubs. Eating nutritional food has no correlation with doing homework. 6-7 hours of sleep is adequete and manageable with all the other things I do. To answer your question, I do a little trick called time management skills. During boring classes, i optimize efficiency by doing homework or studying to reduce time back at home. I take naps on bus rides to ensure that i am energized for the day ahead. I plan what i'm gonna do and what i have to prioritize. \"\"As a student, I don't get home from school until 4:30 or 5:00 and I am doing homework sometimes until 8:30 almost every night.

On top of that, I have to get up every morning at 5:30 am just to catch my buss at 6:40. Many mornings are very hard for me because of lack of sleep from the night before staying up doing homework and studying for two or three tests the next day.\"\" so you do homework until 8:30 and yet you can't find adequete ammounts of sleep. 8:30-5:30 is like 9 hours of sleep, that's plenty. You need to either A) know how to stress yourself out less by doing exercise or meditation or B) stop trying so hard in school and learn to be more efficient. You most likely taking classes you can't handle and that's why your overstressed. \"\" they banned homework, test scores might improve because then students would have more time to study and be prepared than if we have five different subjects to do on top of studying for a test the next day.\"\" That may not be true, most kids when given free time, watch netflix or play Xbox. The really dedicated ones who would study if they had time most likely already do study since they prioritize. Also, kids can study in the summer if they really wanted to. \"\"one reason why homework should be banned is because homework is just too much.\" why don't we just assign less homework then and not ban it completely. \"\"Another reason why homework should be banned is because it is evil.\"\" Lol, you have plenty of time to go to sleep. Homework is voluntary, the government doesn't force you to do it. You are obligated to do it for a better grade but you don't have to sacrifice everything if you truly don't want to. \"\"according to research some of the smartest country like Finland and Japan don\"t have homework. We can be just as smart as or smarter than them without homework. This shows that homework have no academic achievements towards grades. This is why kids should not repeat not have homework.\"\" This statement has no evidence to back it up. You cited Finland as an example of where there is no homework yet they're doing fine. This article to some extent agrees with you, but it also shows that they're are factors aside from that. In Finnishsocieties, teachers are looked as something good for the community. Finnish classroom sizes are also much smaller which allows for more individual learning time. In Finland, they're are no accelerated class so everyone learns at the same pace(which is bad for high achievers like me). We cannot become like Finland!! Abolishing homework does not lead to more academic success, that is from the basis of a logical fallacy. Correlation between no homework and high test scores does not mean causation. You know what is correlated with better test scores? Good teachers, which Finland has an America sadly lags behind in.\"More than two decades of research findings are unequivocal about the connection between teacher quality and student learning.\" http://www.smithsonianmag.com... http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org... onto my main points Homework is far from pointless. It exercises the most important organ in your body, your brain. Without homework, we wouldn't mentally stimulate ourselves and we won't apply ourselves anywhere outside of school. Doing homework ensures that you know what the teacher is teaching and you know if you understand concepts enough to apply them to homework questions etc. The education system is here to prepare ourselves for the workforce and stressful scenarios. Oftentime, people who work have things or objectives to complete at home(businessmen) and homework teaches people how to prioritize outside of the workplace. Homework is voluntary. You won't get arrested for not doing homework. Homework is just work in itself, if you want to apply yourself and get a good grade, you should do it. If you can't handle all the stress and all the time management you have to do, then don't. It's simple really. Homework prepares you for the workload you will receive in universities. Universities oftentime require their students to write essays, lab reports, take home tests, and a whole lot of other stuff. If students weren't taught how to effectively do homework and essays at home outside of school, then these students may fail these courses. Our university system is the BEST in the world, you can't disagree with that. Our homework load prepares us for these awesome universities. 6 out of the top ten universities are in the US, 4 in the UK, and both do homework. Where is Finland on that chart?

Con Case My case will address several factors that strongly oppose the outright reduction of homework as well as opposing the imposition of a 9 to 5 school day (increased). These are not rebuttals to Pro\u2019s Case but arguments that in themselves oppose great reduction in homework & lengthening of school day. School Day Length Lengthening the school day will ultimately detract from the extra-curricular activities that Students can participate in, both by directly decreasing the amount of overall time available for those activities and by decreasing the viability of participating in activities. \u00a7 Reduced daylight hours available, shortened leisure hours available for decompression from the now lengthened school day, less time to complete homework and more importantly study for examinations, less time and less prime hours available to obtain and work an after-school job. o It is important to the end of educational and social development that extra-curricular activities be a part of a student\u2019s daily or weekly routine. Participation in extra-curricular activities yields better development social and intellectually. Benefits of participating in extracurricular activities included having better grades, having higher standardized test scores and higher educational attainment, attending school more regularly, and having higher a higher self-concept. Participants in out-of-school activities often learned skills such as teamwork and leadership while decreasing the likelihood of alcohol use and illicit drug use and related problem behaviors. Those who participate in out-of-school activities often have higher grade point averages, a decrease in absenteeism, and an increased connectedness to the school. (Wilson, U. Wisconsin-Stout, 2009) [1] Homework Guidelines Homework is a necessary tool of education. By extension, reductions in Homework will hamper ability to fully develop and achieve the best level of education & should be seen as a failure on the part of the education system. There are several components of homework that are valuable in themselves, both educationally and socially 1. Preparation \u201cHomework teaches pupils to take responsibility for their tasks and prepare for life after school. Homework prepares pupils for their next stage in life\u201d. 2. Scheduling \u201cHomework is a way to organize time. It is also a way for teachers to organize their lessons to include appraisal of homework and testing. Homework is also part of organizing one\u2019s free time\u201d. 3. Control and assessment \u201cThe teacher assesses work done by assigning tasks followed by appraisal and testing. This helps a teacher to monitor a pupil\u2019s development\u201d. 4. Love and care \u201cHomework contributes to family members helping each other.\u201d 5. Identity and status \u201cHomework is a sign of a pupil\u2019s identity and acknowledgement that a child is now \u201cbig enough\u201d to take responsibility for one\u2019s schoolwork. It also gives status to a particular subject. When a pupil gets homework to do in a particular subject, that subject gets more respect\u201d. 6. Community and contact \u201cHomework serves to improve communication between teacher and parents\u201d. 7. Work performance Hellsten\u2019s conclusion is that a pupil\u2019s work done in school is not seen as a task carried out. (Hellsten 1997 as cited by Dennis, Malm\u00f6 h\u00f6gskola, L\u00e4rarutbildningen, 2007) [3] Homework teaches responsibility and offers a sense of achievement \u201c[H]omework for pupils is an integral part of the working methodology of the school. To teach pupils to take responsibility for a task suited to their individual capabilities were an important part of character building which the school is responsible to provide\u201d (Skol\u00f6verstyrelsen, 1980 p 50). It even pointed out that homework should be used to give pupils the opportunity for revision and practice, important methods of learning that serve to secure knowledge intake of knowledge and the learning of skills. (Skol\u00f6verstyrelsen as cited by [3], 2007) [3] The type of homework assigned is critical. Homework in itself as a tool or an institution cannot be held responsible for the failure of teachers or \u2018the system\u2019 to assign meaningful and useful homework. Subject influences effectiveness of Homework Homework can be assigned in several ways. Research has shown that the most effective way is to assign homework daily. In the USA, more research has been carried out than in other countries. In his book, The Battle over Homework (2001), Harris Cooper summarizes 120 studies on homework. \u2026.Studies carried out on older children [high school] show that homework has a greater effect on their ability to learn but that ability varies depending on the subject. For example, in math, the difference in performance between those who had done their homework and those who had not, was very little, while greater differences could be seen in subjects in the areas of social science and language. The latter areas are areas that demand more factual and repetitive learning on the part of the pupil. [3] Students whose parents have achieved a higher level of educational success do more homework than students with parents of less educational accomplishment. This is representative of the value of homework, those who have attained greater education require greater time spent doing homework from their offspring, an obvious endorsement of the institution. On an average day, 39 percent of high school students whose parent(s) had less than a bachelor\u2019s degree did homework, compared with 52 percent of those with a parent who had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. In addition to being more likely to do homework on an average day, high school students whose parent(s) had higher educational attainment spent more time, on average, doing homework. Twenty-four percent of students with a parent holding a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher spent 2 or more hours doing homework, compared with 13 percent of those whose parent(s) held less than a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Allard, Monthly Labor Review, 2008) [2] Homework: memory/motivation Homework is an integral part of the process of committing learned lessons to memory. ...homework assignments [review] what has been done in the classroom ...it is beneficial to associate what is being learned to what is already known.[when] based on things that people have already mastered, it is easier to store knowledge in one\u2019s memory. ...assignments which are not too difficult provide better motivation and pupils feel motivated if they can manage an assignment and the risk of failure is small. [3] Conclusion A 9-5 school day will harm students by decreasing time to participate in extra-curricular activities (sports, clubs, jobs, volunteer/community work, decompression, educational leisure) that are key to students\u2019 development. Homework is an integral part of the educational process and offers a number of benefits to Students, Teachers, and Parents/Families. The decrease and or elimination of Homework coupled with the lengthening of the school day does not provide sufficient added benefit to students or to society to justify making a change to the current school day and education model (it in fact would be harmful to students\u2019 education).

Teachers should be teaching these things in class, not making the students learn it themselves. It's preventing children from leading balanced lifestyles, with a healthy amount of sleep and activities to keep them fit and active. How is a student supposed to do 3 to 4 hours of homework, study for a plethora of tests and quizzes, play sports, get involved in the community, eat food with nutritional value, and get an adequate amount of sleep, all in one day? That's not possible. The amount of stress homework causes kids is ridiculous, especially when they're already under so much pressure to get into a good college and do well in school, along with making friends and staying active. Homework is not necessary. Homework is pointless because kids do enough work in school and they don't need more. When they come home they want to chill out, hang out with friends, or do something. Kids are in school for 8 hours a day doing work, other than lunch and recess. Homework is not relevant for kids. I did a survey at school at resource, and a majority of kids say that homework should be banned in school because it is stressful and they procrastinate until the last second. There is no point in homework. It takes away from spending time with family. According to the text with research 'Homework Should be Banned,' \"Schools has increased from 9 to 3 with 1 \" hour of recess and lunch to 8:40 to 3:15 with only 30 minutes of lunch and recess.\" This quote shows that too much is just too much homework. Also, another reason is that, according to research, some of the smartest countries like Finland and Japan don\"t have homework. We can be just as smart as them without homework. This shows that homework has no academic benefits for grades. As a student, I don't get home from school until 4:30 or 5:00 and I am doing homework sometimes until 8:30 almost every night. It is very stressful when you have seven classes a day and homework in every single class; it becomes very overwhelming. On top of that, I have to get up every morning at 5:30 am just to catch my buss at 6:40. Many mornings are very hard for me because of lack of sleep from the night before staying up doing homework and studying for two or three tests the next day. If they banned homework, test scores might improve because then students would have more time to study and be prepared than if we have five different subjects to do on top of studying for a test the next day. Homework should NOT be assigned in schools. It is just a waste of time and is just too much. One reason why homework should be banned is because homework is just too much. Schools have been increased so there is no point into giving homework. According to the text with research Homework Should be Banned, \"Schools has increased from 9 to 3 with 1 \" hour of recess and lunch to 8:40 to 3:15 with only 30 minutes of lunch and recess.\" This quote shows that too much is just too much. Students should not cry because of homework. School has been expanded. Have you ever wonder why lunch has been a little shorter than in 1st grade? To include to that too much homework is bad for you. As they say \"Too much of something is not good for you\". Second of all, homework just makes kids hate school even more. According to the text Homework should be eliminated, it says \"Excessive or pointless homework turns children away from the joy of learning.\" Homework is the only word kid\"s fear. This quote shows that homework should be fun; it should not be a torture. Every time in school, at the beginning of the year, you\"ll hear \"Have fun\". Students cannot have fun when homework is torturing kids. Like Jia Ming said, it is no help. Learning needs to be a positive experience learn with a smile and you can walk an extra mile. Another reason why homework should be banned is because it is evil. According to the text Homework should be Eliminated, \"When students have hours of homework, they don\"t get enough sleep, sunlight, and exercise.\" This shows that too much homework can cause be things to happen. You don\"t spend time with your family, your backpacks become really heavy, and this explains why kids are obese. Kids spend so much time doing there homework they don\"t have time to even go to sleep. These things can cause a lot of pressure and stress in high school. Also another reason is that according to research some of the smartest country like Finland and Japan don\"t have homework. We can be just as smart as or smarter than them without homework. This shows that homework have no academic achievements towards grades. This is why kids should not repeat not have homework. Finally homework is just too overwhelming. After school, you either have to do chores or go to after school activities. According to the article \"Homework Should Be Banned\", it says that \"homework should vanish because sometimes when you have homework, you have other activities to do such as music lessons, or an after school job\". Homework is just too big. When you have a lot of after school activities you end up doing it at the last second. To prove it I sometimes see many kids doing homework during breakfast hmm\"Felix...Too much homework can cause stress and give kids a bad grade instead of helping. Inundating children with hours of homework each night is detrimental, the research suggests, while an hour or two per week usually doesn't impact test scores one way or the other. However, homework only bolsters students' academic performance during their last three years of grade school. \"There is little benefit for most students until senior high school (grades 10-12),\" Walker told Life's Little Mysteries. The same basic finding holds true across the globe, including in the U.S., according to Gerald LeTendre of Pennsylvania State University. He and his colleagues have found that teachers typically give take-home assignments that are unhelpful busy work. Assigning homework \"appeared to be a remedial strategy (a consequence of not covering topics in class, exercises for students struggling, a way to supplement poor quality educational settings), and not an advancement strategy (work designed to accelerate, improve or get students to excel),\" LeTendre wrote in an email. This type of remedial homework tends to produce marginally lower test scores compared with children who are not given the work. Even the helpful, advancing kind of assignments ought to be limited; Harris Cooper, a professor of education at Duke University, has recommended that students be given no more than 10 to 15 minutes of homework per night in second grade, with an increase of no more than 10 to 15 minutes in each successive year. Most homework's neutral or negative impact on students' academic performance implies there are better ways for them to spend their after school hours than completing worksheets. So, what should they be doing? According to LeTendre, learning to play a musical instrument orparticipating in clubs and sports all seem beneficial, but there's no one answer that applies to everyone. \"These after-school activities have much more diffuse goals than single subject test scores,\" he wrote. \"When I talk to parents \" they want their kids to be well-rounded, creative, happy individuals \" not just kids who ace the tests.\" That is why Homework is Futile!", "qid": 47, "docid": "ed89f195-2019-04-18T15:14:40Z-00005-000", "score": 6.179500102996826}, {"content": "Title: Homework is a waste of time Content: Unrelated argument: \"majority of students cannot simply memorize theories instantaneously\" -> I did not claim any student could do so.

If that is the case then your argument about linguistic skills is still irrelevant as it doesn't prove why homework is a waste of time. \" Students may learn to apply the theoretical knowledge that they learned in class on an abstract word problem but that doesn't mean that it develops a deep understanding of the subject. Word problems simply reinforce a narrow versions of the information that the student learned which only serves to pass the upcoming text.\" http://www.colorincolorado.org... This article seems to directly contradict your claims that word problems don't develop understandings of the topic. Also, please provide sources that prove your claim because im assuming that BOP rests on both sides of the debate. \"The flaws that it demonstrates in your understanding are on the shallow level since they are only in relation to a narrow question. This is why test are not an accurate measure of fundamental understanding and therefore nor are exercises.\" Here's an example to demonstrate my point. If you were studying differences of perfect squares and you were to do 1 exercise but fail to do so, one would naturally assume that your understanding is not adequate. Now before you say that learning about difference of perfect squares is only shallow, the theory of differences of perfect squares will be useful in future tests as maths tends to be built on theories learnt previously to further develop an understanding. Also, when criticizing \"Any studying system develops dedication and persistence therefore this argument is pointless\" If any do please list them in your rebuttal because your refutation is incomplete without it \"Homework also generally leads to better grades which then leads to a better grades when applying for separate colleges or universities. By dedicating time towards studying towards something, you are improving your chances of being accepted into a higher-caliber education facility which then leads to more career options.\" -> This argument is bias, he uses the word homework instead of studying which would support both are cases. My apologies it was a typo, you can observe that the phrase \" towards studying towards something\" doesn't make sense. What i meant to say is that \"By dedicating time towards homework...\" \"-> Good social skills will give much more career advancement opportunities to person than graduating from a high university. To advance in the job market a person must be good at teamwork, not cause conflict in the workplace and have a good relationship with their boss. In addition, having contacts can be very beneficial on the job market and when upper management position open up, companies look for people who can achieve their quarterly goals and that takes people skills. Those who merely studying all the time will only be able to do office paper work or the technical aspect of their job.\" Warning: rebuttals coming up in the next 3 paragraphs apply to the quote below! I strongly disagree with this statement. Not only does this statement fit only a niche audience but it seems completely irrational. First of all, few promotions include upper management jobs. Sure, there might be hospitality jobs that offer promotions but in general for accounting business, law firms, health departments and chefs, to earn promotions in these jobs, people in charge would surely choose someone who is more skilled in the field with mediocre social skills over someone who has better social skills but is not as skilled in the job. 2nd of all (this applies to all sorts of jobs), employers attention will only be drawn if the employee is skilled in the job. examples include if someone is highly proficient at being a cashier, the employer will most likely pay attention to that person. This is not the same for someone who has high social skills as these social skills cannot be observed in the line of work. Thus the person with better technical skills will most likely receive a promotion over someone with high social skills and how do you ask, do you get these technical skills? By doing homework to advance in grades and have a higher understanding of the task then everyone else. You'll have to bear with me with all these rebuttals of this one argument my opponent has made, but the quote \"having contacts can be very beneficial on the job market and when upper management position open up,\" does not seem logical to me. Generally when upper management jobs open, they are looking for someone with experience. This means that you must have had a management job previously which is unlikely when you have good social skills. (same argument as above) \"Those who merely studying all the time will only be able to do office paper work or the technical aspect of their job\" This is false because those who don't have the technical caliber required for paper work or technical aspects would mean that they would likely receive jobs that are considered lower that office jobs because like i said before, it is very unlikely employers will hand you a management job straight on the spot. \"High school is not designed for acquiring jobs, they are designed to give every student a broad knowledge of subjects. This is necessary in opening student's minds to subjects they haven't tried but might enjoy.\" This argument is relevant because it serves as a rebuttal for your argument of \"In addition, when a student gets a career, he ends up using only a small portion of the knowledge that he learned at school. Therefore, what he mainly relies on is the previous skill sets that he acquired.\" \"These claim are not based on a reliable source: \"Homework is essential to a school child's life as it reinforces things learnt in class as many students only remember 10-20% of what teachers say in class after 3 days. (2) , it is essential to engage in participatory activities such as homework as this increases the remembering rate to 65% after 3 days.\" It is not enough just to say that they're based on a reliable source. You must prove to me that they are an unreliable source. \"This claim is not made by a reliable source: \"This is due to us only learning 10% of what we read after 3 days of reading the material\" Same rebuttal as above. \"- The fact that math is currently taught by application does not prove that human can only learn using their skills in practical methods.\" The quote from source 2 (http://changingminds.org...) explains a quote from a Chinese proverb stating that \"What I hear, I forget; What I see, I remember; What I do, I understand.\" This quote is perfectly relevant and serves as a rebuttal towards your argument Sorry for the late argument as i have exams and a bit busy atm", "qid": 47, "docid": "6013445a-2019-04-18T15:28:44Z-00003-000", "score": 6.151299953460693}, {"content": "Title: Homework Should Be Banned Content: My opponent has called the 2006 study of Duke University \"outdated\", while countering it with a study done in 2003, which is clearly older, covering data only up to 1999 [1].He then proposes a \"study\" from September 2013 [2] as a more reliable and current source. This article relies on the 2007 \"The MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, 2007: The Homework Experience\", conducted by Harris Interactive.Since my opponent introduced this, the following is NOT a new argument. I quote from that very study he entered as evidence:\"MAJOR FINDINGSMost teachers, students and parents believe in the value of homework. A majority of each of these key stakeholders thinks that doing homework is important and helps students learn more in school.[...]Three-quarters of students (77%) believe that doing homework is important or very important and seven in ten (69%) agree that doing homework helps them learn more in school. [...]School-parent relations have improved since 1987, at the same time that parent-school contact is more common. [...]A majority of parents believe that the right amount of homework is assigned. [...]Lower achieving students and high achieving students differ in their approach to doing homework, with lower achieving students spending less time on homework and less frequently doing homework at home. [...]Students who do not believe that homework is important are lower achieving and say they receive a poorer quality of education than others. [...]Teachers assign homework to meet a variety of student needs, including skills needed for their current school work, as well as skills that can be applicable to their future schooling, employment and ability to successfully navigate life in general.\"I must admit that this study is indeed an eye-opener. Unfortunately, it is clear that this study does nothing to argue for the abolition of homework: \"This chapter explores students\u2019, teaches\u2019 and parents\u2019 evaluation of homework\u2019s benefits and challenges. In addition, the perspectives of a group of education leaders are incorporated regarding perceived problems and potential steps towards improvement.\"So, what the study referenced by my opponent says is that despite all his claims to the contrary, relationships between parents and school have improved over the same time that the amount of homework has increased.A vast majority of students accepts homework and acknowledges its value.My opponent chose to keep all these findings to himself, trying to base his arguments off of fragmented data.The fact that teachers abuse homework has already been addressed by me. This clearly calls for a regulation of homework. But again, there is no logical connection between the amount of homework increasing and having to ban it. As I said before: only because something can be taken to the excess, where it becomes harmful, this thing doesn't have to be abolished, regardless of what it is. Claiming otherwise creates a false dichotomy: either to have too much of something or have nothing at all. But that leaves a big space in between disregarded.So, students do more homework today. But the study my opponent introduced shows - see above - that those students who do more of that homework also achieve better grades. So it's not a bad thing at all.The poll by Gallup my opponent offers as evidence clearly says: \"stress due to activities\" before adding \"and homework\". So this poll isn't about homework exclusively, and thus contains data on activities beyond school as a reason for stress. Based on that compilation of data, we can sadly not discern what is considered to be the reason for that stress: activities or homework?My opponent concedes that homework is a good way of assessment.He disagrees with my argument about homework being a less stressful alternative to surprise exams, but does not provide any argument against it.He admits that a wide variety of approaches to grading is existent, which means he now concedes that not all homework is a danger to the students' success.My opponent claims that there is enough opportunity in class to check every single student for mistakes and understanding, but that is clearly not the case. Class is not the proper place to address every single student's problems individually, since the teacher can only discuss the problems of one student at a time. Revised exercises allow the teacher to address each pupil individually. If the students do their exercises by themselves, which is necessary for their independence, why should the exercise be done in school, while the teacher just sits around doing nothing? It would be a waste of time. School time is for instruction, homework for practice. This way, school time is used most efficiently.\"even if it means not showing them what working is like.\"Then what is the purpose of school at all? School exists to prepare children for their professional training and working life. As seen above in the MetLife Survey.Being in school is not the same as a working life. All the students have to do is watch and listen, they bear no responsibility except for themselves. The only time of the day a student spends in a way comparable to what working adults do is during homework, as far as school goes. So my calculation still stands. It's very easy: adults are regularly dispensed from WORK for TRAINING. So there is a distinction. School time simply isn't work.\"And long term projects and reports can serve a much larger lesson than 30 math questions. They have to compile information, and make sometimes presentations. Many businessmen do similar work, scientists always have to research, people based in political matters have to do research and sell what they think. Even teachers have to use presentation skills while teaching their students.\"This is a valuable lesson, too, which is why we have these assignments in addition to homework. But again, this creates a false dichotomy: it's not like these two lessons are mutually exclusive. Why should we rob students of valuable practice that improves their performance (as shown in the MetLife Survey)?\"Failing tests can put a load of stress on a student, but 2 hours of homework adds to it.\"That makes no sense at all. Completing one's homework is very reassuring and thus reduces stress.\"practice doesn't help in keeping calm\"That makes no sense either. Practice is known to reduce exam anxiety:\"4. Exam-taking preparation Practice on sample tests in the textbook or study guide.\"[3]Freezing or running off during exams is a well-known phenomenon: \"It manifests itself physically through episodes of sweating, nausea or \u201cbutterflies\u201d in your stomach, and psychologically through confusion, mental blocks and panic attacks.\" [4]So, in summary:My arguments still stand, while my opponent has done nothing to prove that any of his concerns actually necessitates or warrants the abolition of homework.His own sources - had he read them closely - say that homework is beneficial and accepted by an overwhelming majority of students, parents and teachers alike.There is nothing to be added.I thank for this opportunity to state this case and thank our readers for following us. Take care.

Let me tell you what happened in this debate. Firstly, I told you that homework is beneficial in moderate amounts. My opponent then tried to rebut this argument, saying that \u201cmoderate is a relative term, and how can you ensure that this MODERATE happens\u201d however, I have already answered this, I regard moderate as one or two pieces of small homework due in two or three days and the occasional large coursework or studying for a test. Furthermore, the title of this debate is \u201cHomework Should Be Abolished\u201d, not \u201cHomework Should Be Regulated\u201d. Ensuring that \u201cmoderate happens\u201d is irrelevant. Also, just because some teachers can be mean and give large amounts of homework doesn\u2019t mean all homework should be banned. That is a rather extreme response to such a small thing, don\u2019t you think? I think so. Also, my worthy opponent said that \u201cany benefits homework might have given a child doesn't work as the child won't have done the homework because there isn't enough time in their schedule\u201d, however, as I have already shown you, moderate amounts will allow the child to do the homework. My opponent then tried to tell you that homework is time consuming, it can put unnecessary pressure on a student, and the student doesn't always do the homework. However, I have already answered the first point, as I have kept saying \u201cin moderate amounts\u201d which my opponent keeps brushing aside with a few remarks. Furthermore, my opponent said \u201cpupils will have to wake up early in the morning at say, 6:00 just to get to school on time\u201d, however, it takes an average of 45 minutes-> 1 hour to get ready. Taking the latest time, the student will be able to get to school at 7:00. Normally, school starts at 8:30, is there really no local school, and it takes 1 hour and a half to get to school!? Also, my opponent gave the example of a schedule. She gave the times 6:00am->9:00pm at the latest. If the student has such an extreme schedule such as this, the student is clearly overworking him/herself and should consider dropping a few extra-curriculars. But the majority of students don\u2019t have such extreme schedules such as this. My opponent\u2019s second point, again, has been rebutted as most schools don\u2019t give out heaps of homework, merely moderate amounts. My opponent\u2019s third point, however, is an extreme case. How many student\u2019s parents would do their work for them? Not many. The majority of parents are responsible, and would therefore make the child do their homework themselves. Your case is an extreme case, and not the majority, so your argument doesn\u2019t hold much credibility. Then I went on to tell you that homework enables school days to be shorter. Once again, my worthy opponent tried to rebut my argument. She said that \u201cAlso, teachers are known for giving their students a review sheet to do in class so they can be sure a student has fully grasped the concept. With this structure, homework is made obsolete. Therefore, a school day would simply remain the same length as homework would become non-existent.\u201d However, this doesn\u2019t answer my point at all. She has claimed that with a review sheet in class, homework is made obsolete, so the school days would remain the same length. However, what about all the coursework and studying done at home, not to mention all the finished classwork. We can\u2019t guarantee the student will do it. So my opponent has not properly addressed my point. After all, one measly review sheet can\u2019t add up to work being done at home. In Round 3, my opponent tried to tell you that there is no need for homework and children can still work at home. To back up her point, my opponent tried to use my own source against me. She pointed out that \u201cThe value of homework has been the subject of various research studies over the years, yet there is still no conclusive evidence that it makes a big difference in helping students improve achievement. The most often-cited studies are those that conclude that there is virtually no evidence that it helps in elementary school but some evidence that it does improve academic performance in later grades. Yet this newest study looked at 10th graders and found no correlation\u201d, but very conveniently didn\u2019t emphasize a point in there, if you take a closer look, you will find in that quote these words \u201cbut some evidence that it does improve academic performance in later grades\u201d, so in fact, my opponent is helping my case, and supporting my case! Then, in the second part of my worthy opponent\u2019s quote, she said \u201cResearchers who looked at data from more than 18,000 10th-graders found there was little correlation between the time students spent doing homework and better grades in math and science courses.\u201d However, if you continue reading the article she found this from, (https://www.washingtonpost.com...,) you will find these words \u201cBut,according to a study on the research, they did find a positive relationship between standardized test performance and the amount of time spent on homework.\u201d As you can see, my opponent is cherry-picking from the article, choosing quotes which support her case, but leaving out the rest if it points otherwise. My opponent then went on to say that students can do work by themselves. However, let\u2019s be honest. How many of us would actually do that? How many of us, would, if given the choice, do work at home? Not many of us. Not I, and probably, not you. So homework must be mandatory to get things done. As you can see, I have addressed all of my worthy opponent\u2019s points. However, when it came to addressing mine, my opponent fell painfully short. She has not told us why:~homework does not have benefits, merely why the benefits are obsolete, which I have rebutted~there is not work done at home such as classwork, studying, and coursework that take up a lot of time collectively~students would do work at home given the choice, and teachers could trust them to do it and not have to stretch the school day So now, I will leave you with a quote to think over:\"Nothing is more powerful for your future than being a gatherer of good ideas and information. That's called doing your homework.\" -Jim Rohn", "qid": 47, "docid": "f6e16c0b-2019-04-18T12:39:51Z-00001-000", "score": 6.116499900817871}, {"content": "Title: Homework should be banned Content: I will rebut my opponents case this round. I thank my opponent for going this far.Pro's framework\"Firstly, I would like to define homework as work that was meant to be done at home, but is now often done during class. Now, I would like to state my framework for this debate. The purpose of homework is to help students\" futures. Therefore, if the proposition proves that homework does not benefit the future, then they win this debate. I would now like to state my three contentions for this debate.\"I firstly disagree with Pro's framework. Pro says that the purpose of homework is to help stdent's \"future.\" Not only that, but homework is for students to learn about the topic they were doing, and also remeber and practice what they are doing at school. Basically, Practice Makes Perfect. If Pro shows that this is unimportant, he wins. If I show it is useful, I win. I disagree with Pro's framework. BoP is on Pro, which means that he has the burden of proof.RebuttalsContention 1: Income Inequality\"Income Inequality is when poor individuals do not have enough resources to do their homework while wealthier individuals are able to hire tutors or others to help them finish theirs. According to The Pew Research Center, roughly one-third (31.4%) of households whose incomes fall below $50,000 and with children ages 6 to 17 do not have a high-speed internet connection at home. This low-income group makes up about 40% of all families with school-age children in the United States which is a major disadvantage for poorer students. Also, according to the US Department Of Labor, nearly 46 percent of high school students in 2013 were part of the labor force, which has increased significantly. One student named Lincoln Rhodes quotes \" \"I need the spending money, especially with inflation, and money to save for college even if I have to forgo homework,\" says Lincoln, who plans to study engineering in college. As you can see, many of these students do not even have internet access which is often necessary to use during homework. In addition, some individuals have a hard time juggling homework and jobs which they need desperately to support their families. How can we morally obligate students to do homework rather than support their own families?\"My opponent says hat about 40% of people have a disadvantagbe of doing homework, when the other wealthier students can get help with their homework. This argument is irrevelant and useless if we just listen to what the teacher is talking about. Especially the poor ones. Then you can do homework by yourself. What is the big problem of doing homework with your tutor. Thats exactly the opposite of what the teacher is talking about. The teacher wans you to do it alone, if you do it alone, and get it wrong, the teacher won't be mad. Se will just learn you are weaker in those spots of learning.And how much time does homework take? Not that long. Sometimes you can just do homework at class if you tell your teacher that you don't have enough time to do it. Most schools give about 2 pages of homework every day. That \"literally\" takes about an hour depending on the homework.Many students may say that this is a long time. But lets think about this.School is around 7 hours for mostly every single kid. May be 7 hours and 30 minutes, you get the point though. Sleeping is 8 hours. Lets be nice and say that riding and going back to school is about 1-2 hours. This means you have 8-7 hours left to do your homework. Most homeworks \"literally\" take one hour. you have about 6-7 hours left. You can rest in that time. How can you not have time to do your homework. Think about it like that. You have tons of time to do your homework.Contention 2: Counterproductive\"Since many students do not understand the homework they are given, which causes them to feel pressured to cheat on assignments. According to the Brookings Institution, 2,900 six to seventeen-year-old children found that time spent each week on homework had increased from 2 hours 38 minutes to 3 hours 58 minutes since 2005. Additionally, 75 and 98 percent of college students surveyed each year report having cheated in high school. This is an enormous jump in kids cheating today and it can be directly correlated to huge increase in homework given to students now. In addition, forty-three percent of parents admitted to doing their children\"s homework at least once to ease the strain. Almost half the dads, 47%, owned up to doing the homework, while 39% of mothers did so. Homework is supposed to build character however it actually increases cheating and things like parents doing the work for the children. Furthermore, since many kids do not understand their homework, they do the problems blindly and do not learn from it. This will impact children\"s future negatively, since all of the concepts have not been bolstered.\"My opponent says that bcause many homework the students don't understand, which makes them cheat. Just listen at school. There is no need to cheat, you can learn from mistakes. s://learningmythsbusted.files.wordpress.com...; alt=\"https://learningmythsbusted.files.wordpress.com...; /> http://poppies.es...; /> http://b-i.forbesimg.com...; />You don't need to care if you get something wrong. Look at the pictures. Mistakes are merely just you learning. A mistake is if you do not learn from your mistake. It is a mistake if you don't make mistakes but need to make mistakes. Mistakes are learning. Don't cheat. Learn from your mistakes, no need to hide them.My opponent says that over an hour adds to the homework time. They still have 3 hours to rest. Thats a lot.My opponents assertion of 98% of cheating is wrong. Why do you think that 2% won't cheat. Logically, that is wrong. No sources, this is a bare assertion.Opponent says because of homework, they won't know skills. They will no skills. They will not learn the skills if they do not do homework.Contention 3: Ineffective \"There are several studies on homework and academic achievement. However, most have proved Inconclusive. Here is an overview of all of the studies. According to Homework Myth, by 2011, a reviewer tracked down 17 experimental studies, most of which produced mixed results and some of which suggested that homework made no difference at all. In 2012 another reviewer found five more studies. One found that homework helped, two found that it didn't, and two found mixed results. Yet another review was published a few years later, But another researcher with fifteen studies actually compared getting homework with getting no homework, and their results actually didn't provide much reason to think it helped. From four studies, we can conclude that the results are inconclusive and that homework does not help or harm academic achievement making it completely ineffective and a waste of time.\"I will rebut my opponent's case which is in the text.My opponent shows studies which show that homework is not beneficial. First, no one knows if Pro is lying. Next study can be biased. It can just make believe that people should not do homework. They might have tried hard or whatever, because Pro gives no evidence of how the experiment went, this argument is still wrong.", "qid": 47, "docid": "abf51ede-2019-04-18T13:34:18Z-00001-000", "score": 6.116000175476074}, {"content": "Title: Nothing is ever completely beneficial. Content: Rebuttals\"With the ice-cream issue, here is another interesting point. Why is ice-cream bad? It is unhealthy. Why? Lot's of fat ad sugar. Why is that bad you ask? It damages the body. What is wrong with that? You can be ill, die or face painful retribution. What is wrong with that? In itself, nothing. The only reason it is viewed that way is the popular mentality. If the boy did not worry or care about death, falling ill or receiving painful retribution. Then whether it is healthy or not does not matter. I do not want to go into this philosophical debate, but when I said it was subjective, I meant it. Because nothing is really objective. I would not eat ice-cream absurdly, simply because I accept the popular mentality that it is bad for you, but the popular mentality is generated by strings of subjectivity. It is in the interests of mankind, but implying the interests are all the same, is implying we all have the same perceptual set, which isn't true. If the boy loved healthy, and to him dying and pain and the punishment with ice-cream wasn't bad, then there is nothing but benefit for him. To someone else, there might be a downside, but as I argued, benefit is only a subjective matter and must be placed on such a threshold. So from the boy's perspective, he has nothing but benefit. He dies, and what? \" There is wrong in that. Unhealthiness can lead to illness as we explained, and lot's of sugar and possibly death etc. Because of such, it is bad. This cannot be subjective. The human body strives for survival. \"And most importantly, survival is a state of mind.\" [1] So in such a case, it is fact that a human want's to survive. It is not, and never will be a subjective manner. Though someone may think death is nothing, it is human nature to think otherwise. Since everything can lead to death, and the desperation for survival is not subjective, nothing is ever completly beneficial.\"I do admit faults in my example, but let me modify it to someone who simply does not care. He is the ultimate nihilist and does not give a single care into whether he is anxious, stressed, whether he fails or not. He does enjoy things, but does not care till the point where he is never anxious or stressed. He could fail, but so what? Failure has negative connotations bought on by the popular mentality, but it isn't neccesarily an objective truth that failure is wrong. His life might be messed up from the perspective of another, but to him it isn't what is true is that he is having fun doing this task. Thus, only benefit.\" First of all, failure can lead to depression. Depression can lead to illeness, and death, which I have already proved is not good by fact to humans. Having the risk of depression is in itself already a bad side. Since there is now a downside established, and much more unmentioned, such a case is not completly beneficial, nor is any other case.\"The definition is then an entire profit/advantage gained from something. You did not doubt that the advantage isn't subjective, and enitre simply means, \"With no part left out; whole\" Exatcly no part left out. So for it to be completly beneficial, it would have to have nothing but a good side. So if there was some how a neutral side to it, it would be unable to be comepletly beneficial.\"So everything about something must gain profit, which is subjective. So in the case of the nihilist, the situation was the homework and the small bubble around it. As the fact that he did not care meant that any possible failure wasn't bad, it only coincided with his beliefs, so that is a positive. As any possible failures, which he did not view as bad, weren't then even failures, he is simply left with the enjoyment from that work. Nothing but enjoyment. Yes, anything could have suddenly went wrong and killed him, but excusing the fact that he doesn't mind, that isn't relating to the homework, so is not part of his fulfillment, of complete happiness. Thank you.\"In the case of the nihilist, he is having too much fun. Having too much fun can lead to ignorance of all the down sides we need to change in life, which is a down side. Also having too much fun can lead to death, which is bad objectively, as I have proven. In conclusion, nothing is ever completly beneficial as I have proven. Since anything can lead to death, and death is objectively wrong, or bad, nothing can have complete good sides.

Negative emotions, like distress, fear, anger, disgust, and shame, will motivate a child to do something to avoid them, or urge a child to do something that will relieve their effects,\" [4.]. She is not the only psychologist that has spoken up about the obstacles homework poses to children. One psychologist explains, \"What hasn\"t been researched as thoroughly is the association between homework and misery. Homework and lost opportunities for joy. As a child psychologist, I see this up close every day, where over-tired kids and stressed-out parents regale me with problems that could certainly be improved if families had more time to relax and reconnect\" [5]. Psychologists aren't the only ones speaking up for the children, Texas teacher Brandy Young is well known for being a strong supporter of no-homework. \"If something\"s not working as an educator, you need to change it. You\"re here to help these kids,\" says Young [6.] It is my opinion that the emotional and psychological well-being of children should be taken more seriously. It is these observations that have led me to believe that keeping children inside and limiting their free time is unhealthy for their development. Homework is not in the best interests of children and I wish to speak up for them in hopes to spread this awareness to encourage other to stand up for change. I have lost precious moments of life stressing over grades and homework and it is not a life that should be forced on those who are not given a choice. For anyone who grew up spending most of their childhood inside a school, remember the moments when you questioned the authenticity of your time spent there. Let's listen to the children and give them one less reason to stress over by eliminating homework indefinitely. For those who worry about the emotional and psychological risks that homework can add to the stress of child education, the evidence is substantial. For those who worry about children being less prepared for business success in society, we don't need to rush them into growing up so fast. Homework robs children of their free time, time that can better be spent on more engaging and fulfilling activities. Former school teacher Jessica Smock lists a range of activities that children could rather be doing, than homework, and explains why, including; talking with parents, digging in the dirt, and playing dress up. [7]. There is no definitive proof that when children are left to do homework themselves it does not teach them self-discipline, time-management, work habits, because they don't have an example; there is no one there to correct them or guide them. These lessons can be learned in school. After spending the most substantial hours of the day being crammed with information they are expected to go home and do it some more. Free time should be free time. I will focus on the time table I had when I was in high school. At the end of the day I had only 6 hours before I needed to go to sleep or risk being tired when I woke up early for the bus, which if neglected, severely inhibited my performance at school. The weekends didn't make up for the stress of studying for tests, writing papers, and being stuck for agonizing hours inside with lack of social and stimulating educational engagement. When you get to high school, homework builds up from multiple classes becomes overwhelming and what adds to the stress, is big assignments that require time for research. House chores, basic necessities (eating, baths etc.), getting dressed (+1 hour) sleep (+8 hours) bus ride to and from (+1.5 hours) time spent at school (+6 hours) homework (+2 hrs unless there is a big project or essay due).This is how I remember high school. I was tired, and felt like I had little time to do what I wanted. I wasn't the only one. It was psychologically and creatively oppressive. If the school system was improved I may be inclined to accept homework, but not without significant modifications to the whole educational system. I'm curious how you calculated 10 \" 11 hours of free time. Is this in a school day or during the weekends? Not all children experience the same time tables, but one should not No one can deny that homework can be a factor in kids staying up late to take the free time that school has robbed from them. Do adults want to spend the day at work only to come home and do more work? One could argue it would prepare them for potential future jobs, but is their childhood worth that sacrifice? Don't they have a right to be children before their imminent ascent into adulthood? Children aren't adults yet, and should enjoy their time as children while they have the opportunity. It takes time to develop relationships, interests, and an understanding of \"who I am\" and \"what am I here for\" and adults want to further control the time children spend on school-work than on themselves. Leave home time as a time children can feel free from the forced responsibilities from school. As an adult, I am certain that homework did nothing beneficial for me as a child and a teen. Homework was worth the sacrifice moments of my childhood which I can never get back. One has to ask, is homework essential for the growth of children or is it causing them more stress than they deserve. I'd like to point out the very few children coming forth defending having homework as something they themselves feel comfortable and confident about. Isn't it time we started listening to the children? Psychologist Dr. Stephanie Smith says in her own words, \"I am always hopeful that teachers and administrators keep in mind that each minute a child spends doing homework is one less minute they can spend: exercising, spending quality time with family, engaging in music lessons, volunteering in the community, preparing healthy meals, relaxing, engaging in imaginative play, and/or getting the sleep they need to grow and thrive. Is the homework assigned more important than those things?\" [3] Pros Alleviates a component that adds to stress.

Observations OBV1: My opponent is affirming a change in the status quo meaning that my role is to defend the status quo. My opponent\u2019s burden in this debate is to show why the status quo should be changed and as a result of this they hold the burden of proof. Since my opponent holds the burden of proof here, I will not be providing a constructive case. I will merely be refuting my opponent\u2019s case. OBV2: Voters ought to vote pro if, by the end of the debate, they found Pro\u2019s case more convincing than mine. Voters ought to vote Con if, by the end of the debate, I have managed to refute my opponent\u2019s arguments (and therefore proven that the status quo is better than my opponent\u2019s proposed change). Counterplan I will be producing a counterplan upon the resolution. This counterplan will allow me to advance my burden and win the debate but by making a minor alteration to the status quo (and therefore giving me a small share of the BOP to defend it). The Center for Public Education (CPE) produced a balanced report showing both sides to the debate on the necessity of homework. The conclusion that they made was that homework can be bad and get rid of children\u2019s motivation when it is given in high quantity. Homework in moderate quantity produces better effects. With this information being considered, I present the following syllogism: P1: Too much homework is negative. P2: Homework in moderate quantity is positive. C1: Homework should be given in moderate quantity. This simple counterplan advances my burden and also improves the system of homework since it negates the arguments regarding stress, loss of motivation, etc. [Rebuttals] Point 1 My opponent\u2019s report collected data from 14 - 26 years ago [3]. The system of education in all countries has changed since then [2]. As well as the data being largely outdated it is also very limited, in that it only analyzed 0.00000947368% of children [3][4]. This is extremely low and cannot sufficiently prove that homework is a net detriment when 99.99999163742% of the children are excluded from this study. Furthermore, even the article my opponent cites claims that this isn\u2019t a reason to abolish homework - it is merely a reason to change the system [3]. The entire article that my opponent cites next (regarding TIMSS) is contingent on there being heavy homework loads. My counterplan explicitly deals with this issue. In fact the very study my opponent cites states directly after it speaks out the claim that my opponent uses: \u201cThe TIMSS can\u2019t be used to determine if homework is actually helping or hurting academic performance overall. But it can help us see how much homework students are doing, and what conditions are associated with higher national levels of homework.\u201d [5] This conclusively proves that the issue here comes down to homework quantity which is something that is negated already. Point 2 Next my opponent attempts to show that homework places a burden on parents. My opponent fails to explain the impact of this argument which is why it breaks down easily. She states that parents have rebelled and that some parents have gone to court and won. I am confused as to how this advances her burden in this debate. I could easily cite people going to court as proponents of homework and winning. I could easily also show that people have protested as proponents of homework too. It\u2019s a controversial issue - of course there will be people for and against it. That doesn\u2019t contribute or advance your burden in any way. One example is where a boy and his classmates demanded more homework and the parents agreed [6]. This protest negates my opponent\u2019s since this is all they cite to attempt to affirm this point. My opponent\u2019s next paragraph of point 2 is once again contingent on quantity. Homework can cut into family time but given that my counterplan specifically reduces the issue of homework in large quantity this point is negated. The same response can be made for the next point regarding the Stanford researcher\u2019s findings. The next sub point regarding the \u201cone mother\u201d is extremely minor and is once again refuted by the counterplan. Additionally, only 10% of parents find that their child receives too much homework (on a national level); 64% find that their children\u2019s homework is \u201cabout the right amount\u201d and 25% believed that their child was not receiving enough homework [7]. This ultimately means that this one scenario that my opponent cites is in the minority and this will be solved under my counterplan regardless. The next reason is precisely why I am introducing the counterplan. I am aware that people may not have the time to dedicate to producing excellent quality homework which is why I introduced the counterplan which (again) refutes the point. My opponent makes the unsourced claim that most of the time parents need to help out their children with homework. I will not be addressing the bare assertion here. If / when my opponent chooses to source this claim I will respond to it. Lastly my opponent claims that it adds an extra burden on to teachers. The fact of the matter is that teachers are paid to mark homework (as well as fulfill their other duties). If homework were to be removed the salaries of teachers would also decline. It is part of the responsibility of a teacher and it is a burden that they accept and are made aware of when they apply for the job. [8] Point 3 My counterplan partially addresses the point regarding too much time being spent however I will expand upon another point I wish to make. My opponent raises the (unsourced) objection of children losing time for activities and rest. Sutton Trust Research concluded that 76% of children of all backgrounds do a range of out of school activities [9]. This shows that an overwhelming majority of people manage to do homework alongside creative and physical activities (and this statistic only refers to out of school activities). Next my opponent talks about a hateful relationship regarding learning being an issue. This article specifically references to the quantity (which my counterplan addresses). In the conclusion it even recommends that homework should be given in smaller quantities as this is ideal and will help them to learn and to have time to do activities that will help to benefit them [10]. My opponent also lists many things that are beneficial such as sports, artwork and playtime. All 3 of these things are taught / applied at most schools [11]. With this information alongside the statistic that 76% of children participate in out of school activities this point is successfully refuted. Point 4 Again, the review my opponent cites in an attempt to prove that homework results in the loss of sleep, self esteem and childhood is refuted by the counterplan as it once again references to excessive homework and homework taking up valuable time from children. Voters should NOT buy my opponent\u2019s claim that it encourages cheating and creates a gap between the intelligent and academically struggling because this is once again bare assertion on my opponent\u2019s behalf. Afterwards, my opponent quotes Alfie Kohn in an attempt to show that there is a better alternative to homework. The problem is that the proposed change can be done within the status quo, thus making it unnecessary to ban homework. Involving students in decisions about assignments can be done within school and then the assignment can be set once those decisions have been made - this can and does happen [12]. In the final paragraph my opponent quasi-concedes. She says: \u201cAs such, we can improve the status quo by asking students the best way to reinforce what they have learned in class. While this might include some work from home, it probably won't look like the standard version of homework that is uniform, repetitive and monotonous.\u201d She says that the improvement might involve some work from home. My opponent attempts to distinguish this from homework by saying that homework is uniform, repetitive and monotonous whereas her work from home idea will not be. The fact is that homework is simply defined as: \u201cschoolwork that a pupil is required to do at home.\u201d [13]. Meaning that my opponent\u2019s proposition falls under the definition of homework and is therefore, in essence, a concession. To conclude, my opponent is unable to provide any good reason as to why homework should be banned. At best she manages to show that homework (at its current state) can be slightly excessive and can take away time from students. My counterplan addresses this and even if it didn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t a valid reason to ban homework, as this issue can be resolved within the status quo. On multiple occasions she fails to provide the impact of her contentions. I have successfully refuted my opponent\u2019s points and shown why homework should not remain as a part of the status quo. The resolution is negated. Sources [1] http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org... [2] https://www.oecd.org... [3] http://research.indiana.edu... [4] http://www.gapminder.org...

Studying for the SAT earlier is actually beneficial. I however, do not advise to study more than 2 hours on weekdays... Why do I believe that it is beneficial to start freshmen year or before freshmen year you may ask, and I am going to answer it with 1 word: TIME. Think about it, how much time did you waste doing nothing or playing repetitive video games when you were younger? I am too, guilty of that. What better use of that time than to influence your future? Yes, yes, I know, you can learn others things too but that is already expected from you. Most high schoolers say \"You don't need to start studying until the end of Sophomore year.\" But it is simply just procrastinating for the eventual need to study. If you began studying early, the need to spend more time in the future is removed. Especially starting Sophomore or Junior year, you are probably already taking 3-5 AP classes and the homework load is just INSANE! How are you going to find time to do all that homework, study for the SAT/ACT during the weekend or even weekdays and do extracurriculars? The answer is: ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. You simply can't balance everything out without over stressing yourself.

However I believe you have confused your argument. Much of the proof you have offered suggests that increasing homework load is not beneficial. However, the crux of our argument is whether or not we should remove homework altogether. I claim that it is your burden to prove to me that homework itself is counter-productive, rather than an increased homework workload. For example, if I were to adjust the homework amount from 3 projects to 1, or have the homework assignments be reduced from 6 to 3, I don't believe many of your arguments hold.Before I address your points, I'm going to preface the fact that your personal stories are not strong evidence. You keep claiming that it is \"real life evidence\". So are statistical data, as they are also gathered from real people. Personally, I have had a great experience with my academic performance and homework load, but that shouldn't count as \"real life evidence\" enough to counter your example. Since you're making the claim that we should remove homework altogether, make sure your argument works for all students, not just you or your friends.[Point 1:] You make excessive claims. Please cite your sources when you make bold claims like:-> \"Like I said homework does not improve your grade. Its how you were born and how you study.\"Source? Because my experience in college suggested the exact opposite. Perhaps you haven't been challenged enough in a class yet.-> \"About most children in USA stay up through out all night doing most of their homework\"A 2011 Study found that American High Schoolers only spend on average, 1 hour a day doing homework, so 7 hours a week.(Source: http://nces.ed.gov...) Your experience might be completely different, but it is not the norm.[Point 2:] The evidence provided is weak.-> \"A study has been show to state that homework does not increase student percentile of passing there test. Basically to break it down test score in the NYC are remained flat and has been dropping each time during a new benchmark exam and children have been getting homework each grade and the homework increases.\"Your own evidence refutes your claim. From the very same article you linked:\"Researchers from Binghamton University and the University of Nevada conducted a study showing that although homework may benefit some students\"particularly high- and low-achieving students\"it\"s counterproductive for students who are average learners.\"The article says in the beginning paragraph that for some people homework can be helpful, and for others, homework can be harmful. Much of the article talks about changing the quality of homework to be useful for everybody, rather than abolishing altogether. It would stronger if you provided evidence that no homework improved everybody's academic performance.-> \"Another study has been also shown that students who don't do their homework get the same average grade as most of the children who do most of their homework.\"Is this the article you are talking about? (Source: http://www.washingtonpost.com...)The study also says that there is a positive link between time spent doing homework and time spent performing on tests, so isn't that good marker of improving academic performance? The study also makes no claim about whether or not removing homework benefited students.[Point 3] Addressing Hypothetical Claims with Hypothetical SolutionsSince there is little factual evidence presented in the arguments you make based off of my second original point (the teacher's perspective), I offer similarly ungrounded counterclaims to show your argument holds little weight since it sways either way depending if the conditions are right. (AKA: Making a series of assumptions which cannot be shown to be held constant in every case).-> \"That is the reason we have pre- exams and ready- exams to see what children need help on. You don't need homework to see how the well the teacher thinks your doing.\"But a teacher has to modify his/her course daily or however many times they teach per week. Are you suggesting that we have daily/weekly tests in lieu of daily/weekly homework? Wouldn't that defeat the point of removing homework?Another issue is that the longer time between each pre/ready exam, the longer the exam is going to take (since it cuts into class time). Nevertheless, you would always be removing classtime that a teacher could be spending teaching, thus reducing the amount of material that can be taught over a semester or a year. In terms of classes that have standardized tests, this is especially bad for your class as they might not cover enough material for the exam. And if you're thinking about accelerating the pace of the class, that also makes the class harder for everybody, which i believe is counter-productive.-> \"Teacher give a highly amount of homework that children have to stay up to do some children attend after school and it wouldn't be fair for them to have 6 homework's because they would have to stay all night doing it\"This is only problematic if it happens repeatedly. As I showed in [Point 2], this is not the case for most students (high school at least). You also assume that you couldn't explain your situation to your teachers, that you had no say in the completion of the assignments, that somehow 6 classes all assign heavy projects on the same night such that you're forced to spend all night doing it, etc. There doesn't seem to be a complaint here if there isn't a lot of homework.-> \"Would you like it if you had three projects and later on you spend three full days doing it and you cant spend time with family on the weekend?\"Again only problematic if it happens regularly. If it happens once in a while, that is common for most students. See previous point about real time spent working for most American students. -> \"Lets say you did not know you had a typed up writing assiment to do and when you finished typing and you did not know there was no ink. What are you going to do? I bet you would say go to a library. What if your in after school and you came back at five o'clock. And your library closed at 5:00. Where is your time to print? Of course no answer. And everyone does not have a computer. And computers are expensive.\"There are two separate scenarios being presented in one paragraph. The first is a case where you suddenly and temporarily don't have the tools to hand in an assignment. The second is where you do not have the tools to do assignments, period.The solution to the first is easy. If I were that student? I'd ask to submit it by email. Or provide proof that the assignment was done and completed via said email. You could also ask others to print it. Or save it on a USB drive. There are a wide variety of solutions and assumptions being made here, so this case is moot.The second situation suggests it is not fair to assign homework that a student cannot complete (due to a lack of tools). You are correct. I would highlight a (non-comprehensive) list of assumptions you are making:- There is no method possible of getting a computer to use (library, school, friends, parents, work, etc)- You cannot explain your situation to the teacher or the school- The school does not believe you and lets you take the class and fail the grade- You basically have no way to control the situation in any way shape or form- There is no method possible of getting a computer to useAs you can see again, because I could add more information to suddenly make the issue much more easier to address, until either of us can provide factual evidence, the arguments are essentially hearsay.Hence I have demonstrated that the last 3 or 4 points you make are not a solid basis to suggest that we should remove homework.Looking forward to your response!", "qid": 47, "docid": "2439be89-2019-04-18T16:47:44Z-00004-000", "score": 5.985099792480469}, {"content": "Title: A Homework Ban Is A Bad Idea Content: (I typed up a case, but my browser crashed. Now I have to type it all up again so I am sad. Anyways, Happy Belated New Year!)Once again, I would like to thank the judge(s) and my opponent for putting in the time to make this debate possible.DefinitionAs my opponent states, \"Everybody CAN be wrong.\" This includes our views, such as \"The Earth is round\" and \"The Nazis were bad.\" I am doing nothing to advocate these statements, but we could be wrong despite thinking these are right. Rene Descartes once almost proved that he knew nothing because his sense could be fooling him, he could be in a dream, and an omnipotent being could be deceiving him. [5] This demonstrates the uncertainty of things, so Pro's belief in a \"commonsense defintion\" of \"bad idea\" is fallacious reasoning. I would like to proceed using \"bad idea\" in accordance to the general will.ValueSince the opposition has not provided a value of his own, we agree and are bound upon \"equality\" as our value. There should be no disputes, but I will address Pro's skepticism: read my rebuttal in Round 2. As you can see, my contentions that I use to back up my criterion/value does not apply at all to Pro's belief in a supposed \"Bad Equality.\" The only \"advantages\" I put out are impossible to re-create. This \"Good Equality v. Bad Equality\" is completely not applicable.My Opponent's ArgumentsAcademics v. SocializingWe are not ignoring people's needs. In addition, \"exceptions\" are irrelevant to our debate.Personal ResponsiblityThis is irrelevant. By using equality as a value here, we mean equal opportunity for people to learn. The learning environment should be made equal for everybody. Success is judged by the amount of effort IN this equal environment.College HomeworkMy point was that some college courses do not give homework. I am demonstrating this system and nothing else. My question to the opposition was to ask about his opinion upon this system. He has neglected to answer.Foreign LanguageIf homework was graded, a student with parents who are fluent in that language can pretty much tell all the answers to him/her. This is unfair to other students. Students should be given equal opportunity in an equal learning environment, but of course effort can be put in to guarantee success. The point here is that a Homework Ban would not be a bad idea in this case. Homework regulations are irrelevant because the opposition is supposed to be proving why a Homework Ban IS a bad idea.EssaysThe opposition says, \"The mind can't come up with a quality essay in that short period.\" Who said the essay is supposed to be written in that short period? Students will not necessarily be completed in a single period - contrary to the opposition's assertions. In a class, students can learn and practice. There would be enough time to prepare an assigned essay. In addition, I would like to point out a logical fallacy in the opposition's argument: \"a homework ban prohibits this [deep subject courses], leaving the most gifted to have to take less involved, more boring classes.\" I have already explained how the system after a Homework Ban could work.Homework ReductionTo summarize what Pro believes: More Homework, Less Effort = Less Homework, More Effort. That is not what we are aiming for. What we are trying to do is create an equal environment for students in order for them to determine their own successes through efforts. A learning environment based on equality is not the same as equalizing efforts. What is more important is equalizing the workloads for an equal leanring environment. If work is done at home, as in homework, there is room for inequality as shown in my contentions that I will restate later.Effort in SchoolworkWithout homework, teachers will be able to monitor students doing work. This is beneficial to diagnosing what the student is having trouble in. Nothing is difficult to implement there. If a kid was taunted for being \"stupid\" in the hallway, he/she will attempt to improve upon himself/herself. To do that, the kid will want to ask the teacher a question. If not, then while doing schoolwork, the teacher will see it and help.The NCLB Act coupled with a Homework Ban will result in teachers being more aware of how students are doing with subjects through schoolwork. Even if the kids don't talk to the teachers, the teachers will still see the trouble spots. The teacher will see the points that the students missed. This is actually more efficient. A Homework Ban is the best of both worlds.StressIf stress impacts whether or not you can follow along with the material in class as the opposition claims, then if the student does poorly, the teacher can catch it and quickly pay greater attention on him/her so that the student can catch up with the learning that might have been missed. This will take away distractions easily. Anyways, a more interactive teacher will have no problem getting students involved in learning instead of these distractions, and these are the teachers we are pushing for. Barack Obama, the president of the United States, has pledged to provide better quality education. His education policy includes hiring better teachers, and these are the kinds of teachers we are looking for who will make the classroom a more interactive environment. [6]The problem, though, is that there ARE distractions at home despite this \"personal responsibility\" material that is irrelevant.Using this, I can say: School = No Distractions, Home = Distractions. What should we opt for?Missing the PointI understand my opponent's point, but he has no evidence whatsoever to back up his IEP contention. As I have stated previously, schoolwork is the efficient way to judge whether a student is having trouble or not. With homework and its many factors (that I will re-address in my KVI), it is too unreliable to determine a student's real problem.Key Voting Issues/Contentions (KVI)The criterion I provide is that students should be given equal opportunity to do well in school.Homework is subject to many factors, which are my original contentions: Academic Dishonesty Time Money These are the supposed \"advantages\" that many students have other others, making homework very unequal.From this, it is possible to say that a Homework Ban is not be a bad idea. It would ban this \"inequality\" so that we can provide a more equal learning environment for students, supporting my criterion. ConclusionThe opposition has neglected to respond to most of my rebuttals in Round 2. He has also not sufficiently attacked my side, so a Homework Ban is still not a bad idea. Additionally, he has not supported our agreed value of \"equality\" very much. My opponent has also not provided a criterion to work towards. His contentions do little to support his side of the debate that states a Homework Ban is a bad idea. Especially without sources/evidence to back up any of his claims, I believe these are grounds to claim that the negation (Con) has won the debate.I stand in the firmest negation of this resolution, that people are not strictly against a Homework Ban, and I urge the judge(s)/voter(s) to agree and vote accordingly.Thank you very much.

I tried to pre-empt ideas like \u2018the government would have to issue a new transport policy to deal with the increased strain during peak hour, which...\u2019, essentially, implementation issues. Just the sort that result in the US using the imperial system of measurement. I digress. Let\u2019s go to arguments. School Day Con doesn\u2019t refute my points here. Last round I pointed out how the poisons less homework and less freetime can\u2019t apply, giving extensive analysis as per my model; I showed how students got more free time assuming the same amount of homework given! Now, as to whether homework is terribly different from schoolwork, that\u2019s a different matter [see below], but Con hasn\u2019t differentiated between the 2 in terms of benefits. I have - I\u2019ve talked about memory retention - the spacing effect, the encoding specificity principle as exemplified by state dependent and context dependent effects, teacher instruction etc. This is all improved by moving things into schooltime, as I\u2019ve stressed this debate. The Merits of Homework Con says \u201cIt does not make sense for Pro to argue that we should reduce homework yet imply that homework can still be assigned as schoolwork. This is a waste of resources and is largely impractical.\u201d That\u2019s begging the question... it\u2019s what this debate is about! In R2 Con laid out reasons why homework was beneficial. I countered by noting that homework put into schooltime (hence the longer day) still retained these benefits, while adding some \u2013 teacher instruction, stronger student-teacher bonds. I talked about how homework causes familial conflict, as supported by Peter Frost. Con has not discussed how the benefits of homework are greater than the benefits of this homework in school time as \u2018schoolwork\u2019 . I have, as aforementioned and detailed last round. Reduction in General Mischief Extended. A solid school environment reduces the disproportionately high amount of youth crime for the reasons discussed in R2, such as empirical evidence showing how governments reduce harmful drug use, with education being cited as one of the main factors for smoking\u2019s decline being one. Refer to R2. Working Mindset / Lack of Agrarian Workfroce Currently Extended. The school day was made 9-3 because societies were agrarian. They are not agrarian currently. Furthermore, instilling the values of work is important. Why isn\u2019t adult society 9-3? Why aren\u2019t extracurricular activities a big part of work life? There are clear reasons, and preparing children for work life is a big part of education. Also, remember, Peter Frost talked about how homework caused familial discord. The proposal reduces this. Feasibility / Cost On this point Con has directly countered me. Let\u2019s get to it. On cost, as said in R2 and uncountered, private tuition costs are debased, public transport is used more effectively and hence a reduction in the total number of buses and trains the government must actually provide. Also, critically, \u201cparents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home.\u201d \u2013 R2, parents working longer hours means more money for the family and a higher standard of living; Also, remember those disproportionately high crime statistics? Parental concern is alleviated by a secure school environment as discussed in R2. Onto Con\u2019s rebuttals now. Remember the positive financial counterarguments mentioned above when weighing for impact. Teacher dissatisfaction due to an increased workload is rather unlikely as per Con\u2019s logic on homework. The additional time doesn\u2019t have to be purely instructional in nature \u2013 the teacher may assist students, mark schoolwork etc. It doesn\u2019t have to be a lecture. In essence, teachers are simply marking the schoolwork that would have been assigned as homework at a different hour, and crucially, will take less time to mark at school. Why? Students memory is worse for reasons already discussed, and teacher instruction is missing. That means students will have more problems to discuss, meaning the teacher has to take more time in class addressing problems than would occur if the teacher could pre-emptively address student difficulties in the classroom, through instruction. A net save of time for the teacher, plus the students get better results. The teacher workload may actually be reduced here. On the matter of budget constraints and teachers poor pay, it certainly is an issue in some countries. In countries like Finland, renowned for it\u2019s educational system teachers are paid quite well. In fact \u201cTeaching is rated Finland's \"most respected\" profession, and primary school teaching its most sought-after career\u201d - http://www.smh.com.au... Teachers pay in the US is fairly poor. See this graph: http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com... But it\u2019s clear that many countries are capable of increasing their educational budgets or absorbing this cost. I\u2019d like to think that it would be feasible to pay teachers more, although we\u2019ve already discussed the minimal (if even existent) increase in workload above. Readers can decide on the feasibility given political circumstances on an international scale + the benefits mentioned in various other areas. And, for the strongest point in my case... Memory Retention There has been no refutation of the spacing effect, context dependent and state dependent memory effects and how school helps use these effects to increase memory retention. School timetabling forces the spacing effect to occur, vs. massed presentation in the home environment. Better memory retention at school. Physical context is the same with school... and school vs school and the home for homework; better memory retention. The power of these effects has been documented by psychological experiments like the one mentioned in R2. That Con has not responded to the entirety of the memory retention argument is a very, very strong point in favour of the resolution. Summation The points about memory retention, reduction in general mischief, working mindset / agrarian workforce have not been refuted last round, when Con had a clear chance (yes, rules allowed it) to do so. Those are key advantages for the resolution as per R2 and R3 analysis. My model is proven to grant extra free time given the same amount of homework. Con advocates conflicting poisons of less homework and less time. Con failed to differentiate between homework at home vs. in schooltime. I did, citing teacher instruction and other points. On feasibility I can only point to international budgets on education; the US lags behind. However, I have demonstrated how the teacher workload can be reduced.

Content: \"Rebuttals \"First of all, I do not need to go into detail about how good and bad are subjective. As long as people have different perceptual sets, as long as different things affect my perception to yours, which they do, then the way in which things are percieved is subjective. So effectively, this debate is, \"For something to be completely beneficial is for it to only have good sides, and no bad sides whatsoever, dependant on the person.\" This means that if benefit is the good thing according to you, then benefits are subjective. They have to be, they affect the person. Even if we take the definiton, \"Resulting in good; favourable or advantageous\", then we have established that good is subjective. And an advantage from a situation can only affect those involved, as an advantage is \"a condition or circumstance that puts one in a favourable or superior position\". And a favourable position, is again, a subjective matter.\"Yes this is true, however irrelevant. If someone were to think something was completely beneficial, they can have an opinion, however this does not make it completly beneficial. Let us say a boy wanted to eat ice cream. Though he may think it is completly beneficial because it tastes good, or it gives him pleasure, this is not true. He chose to ignore the fact that it is unhealthy. Now if he ate it in moderation, it would be neutral, not beneficial. What I am basically trying to explain is that even if we believe their is no down side, there always will be, so nothing can ever be completly beneficial.\"I am sitting at home, and I am doing an enjoyable piece of work which I have no bouts against, it causes me great pleasure. It is coursework, so due for almost 5 months time, in which we will proceed to get a similar task, but is estimated to finish within a month. Doing this task is also going to raise my work level to the maximum, as it counts as a majority of my mark for which ever exam I am sitting next year. I am also someone who doesn't fear death, and this matters. I realise I could die any moment and take life qualitatively, rather than quantitatively. \" There are down sides to this, regardless if you care to consider them or not. Here are some, you can get a bad grade, possibly making a huge difference in your life. Another thing is that it can cause stress, and anxiety. Though it may not occur to you, it is possible. So as you can see, even though in your example you ignore the down/ neutral sides, they're still there.\"For this to be completely beneficial, there must not be a downside.\" And there must not be a neutral side either. If something were to have a neutral side, it would not be completly beneficial either, even though I didn't mention it in the definition. If there is a neutral side, then it is not completly beneficial, because there are parts that don't effect you, or benefit you.\"Possible downsides could be that it is a waste of time, he could be doing something more enjoyable, and I'll take any you have to give me. However he doesn't fear death, so time isn't a problem, and he did this at his own discretion. At this point, I cannot see a negative to this from his perspective. Maybe from someone else's, but those aren't connected as benefit is subjective. Thank you.\"You exaplined how there are \"possible\" downsides. But even though they are possible, they are downsides to the scenario, because of such, this scenario is not completly beneficial. Subjectivity has nothing to do with it. No matter what, there is a negative or neutral response to any scenario. Your welcome.Sorry for the short argument, I am tight on time right now.\"With the ice-cream issue, here is another interesting point. Why is ice-cream bad? It is unhealthy. Why? Lot's of fat ad sugar. Why is that bad you ask? It damages the body. What is wrong with that? You can be ill, die or face painful retribution. What is wrong with that? In itself, nothing. The only reason it is viewed that way is the popular mentality. If the boy did not worry or care about death, falling ill or receiving painful retribution. Then whether it is healthy or not does not matter. I do not want to go into this philosophical debate, but when I said it was subjective, I meant it. Because nothing is really objective. I would not eat ice-cream absurdly, simply because I accept the popular mentality that it is bad for you, but the popular mentality is generated by strings of subjectivity. It is in the interests of mankind, but implying the interests are all the same, is implying we all have the same perceptual set, which isn't true. If the boy loved healthy, and to him dying and pain and the punishment with ice-cream wasn't bad, then there is nothing but benefit for him. To someone else, there might be a downside, but as I argued, benefit is only a subjective matter and must be placed on such a threshold. So from the boy's perspective, he has nothing but benefit. He dies, and what? \"There are down sides to this, regardless if you care to consider them or not. Here are some, you can get a bad grade, possibly making a huge difference in your life. Another thing is that it can cause stress, and anxiety. Though it may not occur to you, it is possible. So as you can see, even though in your example you ignore the down/ neutral sides, they're still there.\"I do admit faults in my example, but let me modify it to someone who simply does not care. He is the ultimate nihilist and does not give a single care into whether he is anxious, stressed, whether he fails or not. He does enjoy things, but does not care till the point where he is never anxious or stressed. He could fail, but so what? Failure has negative connotations bought on by the popular mentality, but it isn't neccesarily an objective truth that failure is wrong. His life might be messed up from the perspective of another, but to him it isn't what is true is that he is having fun doing this task. Thus, only benefit.And there must not be a neutral side either. If something were to have a neutral side, it would not be completly beneficial either, even though I didn't mention it in the definition. If there is a neutral side, then it is not completly beneficial, because there are parts that don't effect you, or benefit youLook, I accepted your definition before, but this is just being downright meticulous. You have stated that nothing can be nothing but benefit if there is neutrality of some sort. Well then nothing can be nothing but X by that logic. No one can feel nothing but happiness, sadness, anger or love because they would be standing on a floor which they don't have these feelings to. You must have benefit in EVERYTHING for one particular thing to have benefit then, which is absurd. I will now take the Oxford Dictonaries definition, before it gets out of hand.Complete - \"Entire; full\"Benefit - \"An advantage or profit gained from something\"The definition is then an entire profit/advantage gained from something. You did not doubt that the advantage isn't subjective, and enitre simply means, \"With no part left out; whole:\"So everything about something must gain profit, which is subjective. So in the case of the nihilist, the situation was the homework and the small bubble around it. As the fact that he did not care meant that any possible failure wasn't bad, it only coincided with his beliefs, so that is a positive. As any possible failures, which he did not view as bad, weren't then even failures, he is simply left with the enjoyment from that work. Nothing but enjoyment. Yes, anything could have suddenly went wrong and killed him, but excusing the fact that he doesn't mind, that isn't relating to the homework, so is not part of his fulfillment, of complete happiness.

On BoP issues, Con need not have to present a case, but if he does not then any proven benefit is enough for me. As is, a weighing is required. Just quickly, Con couldn\u2019t rebut all arguments of mine last round (as per rules) , yet (as per memory retention and short term memory!) I\u2019ll remind readers that my points \u2018Reduction in general mischief\u2019 and \u2018Working Mindset / Lack of Agrarian Workforce\u2019 and most of \u2018Homework vs. Instruction\u2019 have not been contended as yet. Let\u2019s go to the arguments \u2013 Con\u2019s then a focus on mine. School and Work Life Con laments about how students aren\u2019t being prepared for school. I agree completely and would be ready to debate a host of policies. The point though is whether my proposal increases the time spent on school related work \u2013 currently called homework and time in school. If homework currently is > the increase in schooltime (and reduction in \u2018homework\u2019) then my system gives more time for student use. The converse applies. Let\u2019s assume the net \u2018homework\u2019 component remains the same. Does the amount of student free time, time not required to be at school, increase? Yes. Under the current model lunch, recess and all other breaks occur at set times \u2013 they are immovable to the student; it is bad luck if you\u2019d like to sacrifice a break at school for an equivalent amount of time outside school \u2013 you can\u2019t. Under my model, as readers may recall, you can. Recall in R1 how we had 80 minutes of break built into the day; 40 was automatically set aside for lunch. That left 40 minutes which students could elect to have at the start or the end of the day. If they chose the day\u2019s end then they could leave school at the start of that break. So, in terms of time which students can utilise freely (free time for things like work), my model provides 20 minutes extra for extracurricular activities, work etc. notwithstanding any changes in the amount of homework. If Con argues for a change in homework amount (the extra time ought to cancel out the reduction) then he gets to drink the associated poison. That is... aside from all the other benefits of the scheme, particularly memory retention, which we\u2019ll touch on later. For instance, in R2 I discussed how teacher instruction can help students do homework more productively if they\u2019re stuck. Time saved is time that can be used for the very activities Con values. Con needs to demonstrate how my model decreases available free time. Homework reduction is equivalent to school being lengthened; under my model extra free time is available. Lamenting school\u2019s uselessness is irrelevant unless it can be linked to time for other activities. Con\u2019s calculation makes no sense as well. In Australia a 9-3 approx. (I have 8:50-3:10) day is the norm, although a longer school year is the compensation [1] [2]. Con, why the \u2013 (40*2 \u2013 20) ? Con needs to elaborate on this example. Memory retention, homework, spacing effect Con lamented the failure of school. Con\u2019s first source started with \u201cThe Department for Work and Pensions minister said he was \"genuinely shocked\" by \"the very small number of young people coming out of school with good GCSE passes in core subjects\u201d(about 1 in 6 said later) . What would help with this? Better memory retention. In R2 I outlined how spaced presentation was superior to massed presentation for memory retention purposes, and how school promoted spaced presentation by virtue of the lessons being spaced out on the timetable. Indeed, school forces spaced presentation vs. the massed presentation of the home. Con does state that the spacing effect can occur at home. Agreed. However, this will necessarily happen less than under the model, ergo worse memory retention. Also, I specifically noted that a student will tend to do homework in clumps (say, a bunch of maths exercises) because massed presentation is at work! But it doesn\u2019t end there for memory retention. I recently read Memory by Jonathan K. Foster (first published 2009), one of OUP\u2019s fascination very short introductions. To quote one part: \u201cOther things being equal, we tend to remember information better if we are in a similar physical context and emotional state at the time we wish to retrieve information as we were in at the time we were exposed to that information.\u201d School is more akin to work than the home environment, so as per a more similar physical context we remember better. This is specified in the encoding specificity principle. Also, the emotional state at school is more constant than at home, more like work. This again promotes better memory retention as the retrieval cue matches memories better. This sort of logic strongly explains why we can\u2019t remember dreams \u2013 the physical context is different, our emotional state different and our physiological state are also different. On Con\u2019s other points: Technology is getting better, but it\u2019s no substitute for a qualified teacher at school at the ready \u2013 that\u2019s what my model gives. Also, technology is a wash \u2013 every year 9 student in the public sector is already given a laptop. [3] At least in NSW they do! On comfort, I concede homes are generally more comfortable, although friends can mitigate this discomfort. To recap, homework done at school is done in a manner of spaced presentation. This is superior for memory retention. Furthermore, recall is strengthened by a similar emotional state and physical context, which happens when learning is conducted more strongly in a given place, such as school. These effects far outweigh some minor comfort benefits. Memory is strengthened tremendously by shifting homework to school time. Cost / Teacher Workload Con is right, the US has poor teacher pay: See that? The US is far to the right...I strongly suggest higher pay for teachers, and more respect as in Finland. [4] Would that we could change that. However, Con makes the mistake of assuming a higher workload for teachers, and the associated problems. Evidence? No, assertion. Remember, the increased time at school is in substitute for marking things like homework at home, there doesn\u2019t have to be additional lectures. If Con wishes to contend that homework shouldn\u2019t be marked he can. I'm all for Con's concerns... if they apply to the proposed model, which isn't proven. In fact, reducing homework separates work and home life, which is beneficial. Also, with better memory retention the teacher has to waste less time re-explaining content. Time saved that can be utilised as the teacher wishes. Finally, my cost points weren\u2019t refuted \u2013 debase private tuition costs, reduce day care costs, and, crucially, streamline use of public transport and the like (more efficient, less cost of public transport... maybe those savings could go to teachers pay in a dream...) . And my last point, to quote from R2: \u201cParents can work for longer. There\u2019s less concern for parents to be at home, supervising their children, if they can trust that their child is safe and productive at school, vs. potentially the converse at home.\u201d That point ties into the social mischief point, which hasn\u2019t been contended as yet. Families save money if students aren\u2019t damaging things, doing drugs , as well as earning more through working longer hours of course. Conclusion Con must refute the points of this round + those of mine unscathed of mine by his R2 (in part as per the rules). Con has work to do, specifically, he must prove how his points apply to my model and not just a general attack on schools, and how they outweigh my benefits. I look forward to Con\u2019s reply.

An action can only be consider a waste of time by comparison to an other action. \"The aim of homework is to practice the theories learned in class and to cement that knowledge in the mind.\" - Students may learn to apply the theoretical knowledge that they learned in class on an abstract word problem but that doesn't mean that it develops a deep understanding of the subject. Word problems simply reinforce a narrow versions of the information that the student learned which only serves to pass the upcoming text. \"It's also a time to find any flaws in your understandings and to work extra hard to thoroughly understand the concept.\" -> The flaws that it demonstrates in your understanding are on the shallow level since they are only in relation to a narrow question. This is why test are not an accurate measure of fundamental understanding and therefore nor are exercises. Argument does not address my point :\"High school is not designed for acquiring jobs, they are designed to give every student a broad knowledge of subjects. This is necessary in opening student's minds to subjects they haven't tried but might enjoy.\" -> My point was that students only remember a small portion of what they learn therefore it the skills set that they develop that mainly help them through life. Therefore, this is not a criticism of teaching students a broad amount of knowledge but instead simply stating that the human mind filters out a lot of it. However, the amount you remember is proportional the amount of knowledge you were taught. \"That is not necessary due to many students being teenagers. Teenagers generally experience growth spurts at this age. This means that teenagers figure are not affected by eating excessively as most of that energy goes into fueling muscle growth and hormonal development\" -> I was taking about having more time to improve there health not figure. Also, stating that a teenager figure is not affected by eating excessively is a gross exaggeration. They have a higher metabolism but they can still become fat. These arguments also don't rule out exercising as it is needed for muscle growth and overall health. These claim are not based on a reliable source: \"Homework is essential to a school child's life as it reinforces things learnt in class as many students only remember 10-20% of what teachers say in class after 3 days. (2) , it is essential to engage in participatory activities such as homework as this increases the remembering rate to 65% after 3 days.\" \"By doing homework students will form good study habits, these study habits will eventually carry over to their jobs and careers which would then help them have a fruitful career\" -> The same could be said about reading a textbook and writing down what one understood about the course material which develop the mind as well. \"By doing homework students are continually promoting values such as dedication and persistence. These are essential for when obtaining jobs or for any task in life. So by doing homework you are not only promoting school work but habits that will ensure a bright future.\" -> Any studying system develops dedication and persistence therefore this argument is pointless. \"Homework also generally leads to better grades which then leads to a better grades when applying for separate colleges or universities. By dedicating time towards studying towards something, you are improving your chances of being accepted into a higher-caliber education facility which then leads to more career options.\" -> This argument is bias, he uses the word homework instead of studying which would support both are cases. \"On the other hand socializing does not earn you higher grades as it does not directly contribute towards an improved education. This means that lower grades = more limiting options when choosing colleges of universities. This then leads to having to study for longer periods of time before transferring over to another field. This can simply be avoided by achieving a desirable final mark which then leads to a clear path without transfers to achieving your dream job.\" -> Good social skills will give much more career advancement opportunities to person than graduating from a high university. To advance in the job market a person must be good at teamwork, not cause conflict in the workplace and have a good relationship with their boss. In addition, having contacts can be very beneficial on the job market and when upper management position open up, companies look for people who can achieve their quarterly goals and that takes people skills.

Let me outline a few things that are to be taken as given barring reasonable amendments in round 1.ScopeThis debate is not limited to the US only. Also, the debate focuses primarily on a high school context as we might make exceptions for kindergarten students for instance.HomeworkI divide homework into 2 categories:1. Assignments / assessments / major projects2. Worksheets, maths exercises etc.We are discussing the elimination of type 2. Type 1 still exists, although in a perhaps reduced manner. The extended school day enables more learning (vs. homework) ; Con can dispute this if he wishes later.Timing / School logisticsLogistics, on the school level, is not meant to be a crucial issue in this debate \u2013 bureaucrats could probably resolve this matter. However, the school day would be reworked to accommodate a 9-5. My proposal is as follows:To accommodate the 2 hour extension to the school day an additional 20 minutes of rest / break, in the vein of lunch or morning tea, would be added. This would be added to the 20 minute morning tea and 40 minute lunch break typically found in schools (no negotiation on this \u2013 this is to be accepted) . That totals 80 minutes. Students retain their 40 minute lunch. 2 other 40 minute blocks would be scheduled into the day \u2013 one near the end of the day, one near the start. Students would choose which time block they wish to spend their free time (like choosing an elective; it\u2019s a choice for the same duration that the same subjects are kept) in (40 minutes), and be in class for the other 40; yes, classes aside from this one retain their usual one hour length.Why the complexity?

Content: Before I begin, I would first like to establish the fact that this debate is not about whether cell phones are helpful or not. It is about whether they should be allowed in schools for students to use. Now I would first like to rebut some of the points brought up by Pro. 1. \"I could use it as a calculator, do research on the Internet with it, and do my homework on it\" First of all, not all cell phones include these functions. Secondly, these functions are not exclusive to cell phones. There are better, more specialized apparatus. There are calculators that can calculate and even graph some complex mathematical equations. There are computers, which contain numerous options and are more comfortable to utilize, to research. Third, there are no reasons for students to complete their homework on their cell phones as very few of the assignments require students to use cell phones. 2. \"It was very, very helpful for educational reasons\" Again, this function can be performed better with computers, books and even teachers. I ask the Pro to expound more on there educational reasons. 3. \"Just because kids are allowed to use your cell phone does not mean the school would fall into an anarchy of texting and game playing\" No, allowing cell phones does not necessarily mean that the educational system will fall apart. It simply means that the educational system will lose its efficiency and its purpose as I will mention later in my arguments. 4. \"There would still be teachers to monitor usage and administer punishment when due\" This is a very ineffective and wasteful solution. The fact that teachers, who we entrust our future generation to educate our children, have to act as CIA or FBI that monitors every activities that students perform is degrading. School should be a place of learning and of social interactions among peers, not a prison. Also, there are no ways of determining the \"right\" punishment that is effective. Children generally tend to rebel and loath the restrictions placed upon them, deeming this proposed solution highly ineffective. In addition, there's no way for teachers to monitor the usage of cell phones. Most of the times, students tend to hide and keep their usage furtive. 5. \" Imagine sitting in a classroom where there are no computers\" Most classrooms do have at least one computer. If the school has wi-fi to enable students to use their cell phones to do research, it is extremely likely that is has a library, a computer lab, and numerous other facilities that eliminates the use of cell phones. 6. \" Just being able to whip out your phone and do research on it without having to ask permission to go to somewhere with a computer [is very beneficial]\" I wouldn't call this beneficial. Convenient, yes, but beneficial, not really. If the teacher assigned a research project, he or she would have signed his class up for a library or a computer lab block, or assigned enough time for students to complete the project at home. Again, there's no need for cell phones. Now for my arguments. .. 1. Risk (Monetary) Numerous cell phones worth hundreds of dollars. Allowing students to carry these valuables to school is like turning schools into hunting grounds for thieves. As most students have physical education class or gym class in school, there are times when students leave their valuables unattended. The thieves strike and the students will have to experience the dread of explaining to their parents and possibility that they may not be able to obtain another cell phone. 2. Risk (Personal Information) Cell phones contain miraculous amount of personal information. They contain the contact numbers of one's friends and families. They can be traced by malevolent people to determine one's location and one's various information presented when one purchased the phone and signed the contract. In conclusion, the ultimate point I am making is that there is no need for cell phones. If there is minimal benefits but countless harmful effects from cell phones, it is logical and sensible to prohibit the use of cell phones in school. I will provide more arguments in the future rounds and I await Pro's response.", "qid": 47, "docid": "e91853bc-2019-04-18T16:28:31Z-00004-000", "score": 5.728700160980225}, {"content": "Title: Reduce homework, lengthen schooltime Content: Let us go straight to the arguments. I. Life For the rest of this debate, aka. this round, let us assume that my math was incorrect. Let us assume now that there are 100 minutes of lessons and 20 minutes of break. This was not clear at the beginning. It must have been a brain block on my part. Notice that pro has not in the least addressed the dilemma I created. In it I showed that teachers would have to teach twice as much if half the class elected to take their 40 minutes free time (As presented by Pro) in the morning and the other half in the evening. This would create added work on the teachers. Unintended by Pro\u2019s model, maybe, but present nonetheless. According to Pro, his model actually increases free time outside school. This is weird. There is only 24 hours to a day. Let us assume that the current school time is 9-3, his proposal would be an effective of 9-2:40. However, as stated in his resolution, the model proposes a 9-5 schedule. If he wishes for students to come and go throughout the day with small snatches of time, this would mean small portions of time with no adult supervision at all, aka. time which can be spent committing minor crimes. As far as my experience goes, no company would employ any workers for short snatches of time before seeing them head back to school or something like that. Thus, unless pro meant a reduce homework, reduce school time in his resolution, this model is absolutely impossible to implement for just these two reasons alone. Unless Pro wishes to stay up past midnight doing homework and getting up at 5:30 the next morning to go to school, I suggest not implementing the particular model in which I am familiar with. II. Memory retention Pro has unfortunately continued to ignore the counter-proposal I made in the previous two rounds. Digitalize homework. This is already happening in many places, as I found out through personal experience. Unless Pro wishes for the model to change somewhat when students come of working age, his counter to my points about working is mute (:D). As I showed in the previous point, increasing net free time is not effective unless those free time comes in large blocks, which as far as I understand Pro\u2019s model, is not part of.It would seem that our two studies contradict. However, although Pro\u2019s opinion poll was from CareerBuilder, mine was from Stanford. It is up to the reader to determine whose is the more reliable.The whole point of my citing the study, I thought I clearly linked the two, is that as workers are more productive at home, it must be because they have better memory recall. Note that I have as such turned Pro\u2019s quotation against him, showing that people are more productive at home, aka. remember more, than at work. This also ties in with the conceded point about comfort. All these factors argue strongly against Pro\u2019s model. The fact that most school students do not work is a testament to short-sightedness and lack of life-planning. III. Cost Even were we to concede all of Pro\u2019s points here, they will still not increase the quality of learning. In fact, my point regarding teachers working all-nighters have not been addressed. How does spending 95 minutes at school accomplish what is done in one night? It does not. Not in the least. Should I extend arguments here? IV. Social Mischief My opponent has not shown that crimes are committed disproportionately between 3-5pm. Even if we forced students to complete their homework in school (Negating the whole purpose of homework), you can only keep them in school for so long. Let us assume that we release students from schools at 5pm. Not only does students who have completed their homework have absolutely no motivation to do anything, as pro noted, not even work. This would increase the motivation, brought on by boredom, to commit crimes, reversing any benefit intended by Pro\u2019s model. If, on the other hand, more net free time is given in which no homework needs to be done, like as I noted above, not only would companies not hire such students, they would actually be motivated by boredom to commit crimes. V. Mindset All counters have been adequately addressed for this point in other points. The net effect would not be beneficial, rather, destructive to students. VI. Teacher Instruction As I clearly showed in the earlier round, this is merely an assertion. From personal experience, I know that even though I self-studied for much of my high-school equivalent syllabus, I still outperform the average high-schooler who have the \u201cadvantage\u201d of live teachers. This also is an assertion, but is one that at least is backed by my own experience. Iron only sharpens iron if both iron are as hard as each other. Have you seen katanas cut through long swords? Conclusion So it can be clearly seen that teacher instruction is not a requirement for memory retention, mindsets are the result of nurture, which is impossible to implement for varied reasons I mentioned above, the cost of health for teachers would be catastrophic, unless one increases drastically the number of teachers. Life and memory retention would not benefit from this change in school schedule. In regards to voting, note everything Logic has said.

When a test comes students will not be allowed to search things up. If students are forced to memorize things in class, they will find that studying for a test is easier. Also some students, if allowed to use phones, will start to play Clash of Clans on it or cheat on classwork that they are supposed to do by themselves by texting to others. \"If a student happens to be gone for a day, the student can see on the blog what happened during that class period and what the homework is that they missed even from a different device such as a phone.\" Why would they check there homework at school? Also if a student is sick, they ask a friend what happened when they were gone, and are caught up by the time they get to school the next day. Also I do no believe that this point relates to the topic, as this normally happens outside school, a student will not check what happened yesterday in a class while the teacher is teaching that days lesson. \"For my last reason, some students have very large projects that cannot fit in a car and or in a bus seat.

At the height of the Vietnam War most Americans realized the sick double standard inherent in sending 18-year-old soldiers to fight and die for their country when they weren't allowed to vote. Double standards didn't go away in 1971. Right now youth are subject to adult criminal penalties despite lacking the right to vote. Frank Zimring found that \"Between 1992 and 1995, forty American states relaxed the requirements for transferring an accused under the maximum age of jurisdiction into criminal court,\"2 and \"In Colorado, for example, defendants under the maximum age for juvenile court jurisdiction may nonetheless be charged by direct filing in criminal court if they are over 14 years of age and are charged with one of a legislative list of violent crimes.\"3 What kind of twisted message do we send when we tell youth they are judged mature, responsible adults when they commit murder, but silly, brainless kids when they want to vote? This is a double standard, no different than during the Vietnam War. War isn't a dead issue now either, leaders who youth can't vote for today may send them to war tomorrow. Lowering the voting age is the just, fair way to set things straight. Youth pay taxes, live under our laws, they should have the vote Just like all other Americans, young Americans pay taxes. In fact, they pay a lot of taxes. Teens pay an estimated $9.7 Billion dollars in sales taxes alone.4 Not to mention many millions of taxes on income, according to the IRS, \"You may be a teen, you may not even have a permanent job, but you have to pay taxes on the money you earn.\"5 And teens do work: 80% of high school students work at some point before graduation.6 Youth pay billions in taxes to state, local, and federal governments yet they have absolutely no say over how much is taken. This is what the American Revolution was fought over; this is taxation without representation. In addition to being affected by taxes, young people are affected by every other law that Americans live under. As fellow citizens in this society, every action or inaction taken by lawmakers affects youth directly, yet they have no say in the matter. In her 1991 testimony before a Minnesota House subcommittee, 14-year-old Rebecca Tilsen had this to say: \"If 16-year-olds are old enough to drink the water polluted by the industries that you regulate, if 16-year-olds are old enough to breathe the air ruined by garbage burners that government built, if 16-year-olds are old enough to walk on the streets made unsafe by terrible drugs and crime policies, if 16-year-olds are old enough to live in poverty in the richest country in the world, if 16-year-olds are old enough to get sick in a country with the worst public health-care programs in the world, and if 16-year-olds are old enough to attend school districts that you underfund, then 16-year-olds are old enough to play a part in making them better.\" The just power of government comes from the consent of the governed, as it stands now youth are governed (overly so, some may say) but do not consent. This is un-American. Like all tax-paying, law-abiding Americans, youth must be given the right to vote. Politicians will represent their interests if youth can vote Politicians represent various constituencies; currently young people are no one's constituency. Why should politicians care about the needs and wishes of youth when they have no ability to vote for or against them? Lowering the voting age will give politicians a real reason to respect the desires of young people. Youth feel alienated from politics and politicians, lowering the voting age will include them in the process. The words spoken before the Senate Judicary Committee supporting lowering the voting age in 1971 are as true then as they are now, \"The anachronistic voting-age limitation tends to alienate them from systematic political processes and to drive them to into a search for an alternative, sometimes violent, means to express their frustrations over the gap between the nation's deals and actions. Lowering the voting age will provide them with a direct, constructive and democratic channel for making their views felt and for giving them a responsible stake in the future of the nation.\" 7 Youth have a unique perspective, they'll never have those experiences again A common argument against lowering the voting age is that it isn't a burden to wait a few years. Denying youth the right to vote isn't the same as denying women or racial minorities, according to opponents, since in a few years young people will grow up and be able to vote. Why go through the trouble to lower the age to 16 when after two years they'll be able to vote anyways? Were it that simple, then perhaps, but it isn't. Would it be acceptable to limit the right to vote to those with a certain income, reasoning that it is a flexible standard, those will less income must only work harder or wait till they too make enough to vote? No it wouldn't. Voters vote based on their individual circumstances, when those circumstances change often so do their voting habits. The concerns of a 14 year old are different than that of a 24 year old, just as the concerns of a poor man differ from that of a rich man. The beliefs and priorities of 16 year olds as a class are unique to them; we cannot expect former 16 year olds to have as accurate a perspective as those who are currently that age. If we care at all about the needs and desires of youth, they must be allowed to vote for themselves. 16 is a better age to introduce voting than 18; 16 year olds are stationary Currently the right to vote is granted at perhaps the worst possible moment in one's life. At 18 many youth leave the home and community they have lived for most their life, either to go away to college or to move away from home in search of work. At the moment they are supposed to vote they either have a new community that they are unfamiliar with or they must attempt to vote absentee back home, a process that turns off many new voters. Lowering the voting age to 16 will give the vote to people who have roots in a community, have an appreciation for local issues, and will be more concerned about voting than those just two years older. Youth have comfortable surroundings, school, parents, and stable friends, they feel connected to their community; all factors that will increase their desire and need to vote. Lower the voting age, and youth will vote. Lowering the Voting Age will increase voter turnout For several reasons lowering the voting age will increase voter turnout. It is common knowledge that the earlier in life a habit is formed the more likely that habit or interest will continue throughout life. If attempts are made to prevent young people from picking up bad habits, why are no attempts made to get youth started with good habits, like voting? If citizens begin voting earlier, and get into the habit of doing so earlier, they are more likely to stick with it through life. I ran out of characters. Post your argument then I will finish mine.", "qid": 48, "docid": "68fec0d0-2019-04-18T19:14:41Z-00002-000", "score": 8.231300354003906}, {"content": "Title: The Voting Age should be lowered to 16. Content: Definitions: Voting Age: The legal age at which citizens of the United States can submit their opinion on current matters to be counted during national elections. Hello, my name is Wendell Phillips and I am the PRO speaker stating that the voting age should be lowered to 16. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that xStrikex, my opponent, is a classmate of mine and I am very excited to debate this controversial topic with him. My Points: The limit of 18 is ultimately arbitrary. Previous to the voting age being lowered to 18, the voting age was 21. The reasons cited for this higher age boundary were exactly the same arguments as are being used by those who oppose lowering the voting age to 16, namely that the individuals would be too immature or ignorant to use their vote wisely. As we have seen, 18 year olds are just as capable of making informed democratic choices as 21 year olds, and there isn't any magical transformative process which occurs between 16 and 18 which turns individuals into fully fledged democratic citizens. Rather, maturity occurs on a spectrum, and as will be outlined below, some 16 year olds may be equally or better informed about politics than people much their senior who have the vote. More to the point, there are many things which 16 year olds are deemed by the state to be mature enough to do. For example, you can marry, leave full time education, leave home, and get a full time job, all of which are serious responsibilities. More seriously than that, at 16 one can volunteer for military service, and it seems implausible to claim that one can be simultaneously mature enough to volunteer to fight for one's country yet immature enough to vote. When young people are involved in a meaningful democratic process they respond with enthusiasm and responsibility. Many people of all ages are increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of passion and enthusiasm for politics and for change, a phenomenon that manifests across all age groups in engagement in single issue campaigns and protests. Voting at 16 offers an opportunity for young people to inject more passion and energy into the political system. Young people are motivated by exactly the same issues as older voters, public safety, taxation and the cost of transport there is a lack of evidence that 16 and 17 year olds are more impressionable in their voting habits than others. In 2002, Citizenship was introduced as a compulsory subject as part of the English National Curriculum. At Key Stage 3 young people are taught about the electoral system and the importance of voting, central and local government, and the key characteristics of parliamentary and other forms of government. At Key Stage 4 they explore the actions citizens can take in democratic and electoral processes to influence decisions locally, nationally and beyond the operation of parliamentary democracy within the UK, and of other forms of government, both democratic and non-democratic, beyond the UK. While young people are some of the only citizens to be educated about the voting system, they are denied the right to use this knowledge for at least two further years and anywhere up to seven years. Many people have no real idea about politics. 16-year-olds who care enough to vote are just as likely to understand politics as those who already have the vote. Again, to follow this point to its logical extreme, we should return to a system where only well-educated people can vote, something that was abandoned as classist and backward a hundred years ago. Let me ask you, do we deny the vote to mentally challenged people? Do we deny the vote to people that are completely drunk and stoned out of their minds? Of course we don't, because they are over 18! Tell me, should we allow retarded citizens to vote, yet deny tax paying citizens the right? I rest my case.", "qid": 48, "docid": "6c32784f-2019-04-18T18:59:38Z-00005-000", "score": 8.015299797058105}, {"content": "Title: Lowering the voting age Content: Ladies and gentlemen, in this debate I am here to oppose the motion that the house would lower the voting age to 18. The context of this debate is that there is a low voter turnout. That is the problem that brings us to have this debate. Also this is not due to the fact that the voting age is too high, but it is due to the fact that there is voter apathy and lack of mature and politically active electorate. So, firstly, I will prove that lowering the voting age has inherent harms and should not be undertaken. And secondly, I will present an alternative that raises both voter quality, and participation rates. Moving onto my first argument, which is that it is impossible to find a reliable standard for maturity among young people. And, equating age with maturity is simply wrong, ladies and gentlemen. So, on the first level of analysis, what is the standard of maturity? We challenge the proposition to give us a clear, objective standard, and support for the idea that 18 is a reliable standard, as opposed to the legal age in Korea of 19. And second of all, in the second level of analysis, equating age with maturity is simply wrong, because young people of today are simply less mature than in the past, and are more sheltered than ever. Young people were forced to grow up quickly, and assume responsibility in society quickly in the past, ladies and gentlemen. They were forced to have jobs earlier, to marry earlier, but that is not the case today. Today, many children in Korea are being spoiled, letting their parents deal with their problems, even after they are quite old, ladies and gentlemen. And the so-called \"kangaroo youth\" are becoming an international problem. A prominent example of this is the Hanhwa chairman fighting for his son who was over 20 years old at the time, ladies and gentlemen. So we say that actually young people today are less mature and we see no reason what-so-ever to lower the age more than the maturity age that was in the past. For my second point, which is that young people of today are more likely to vote for style rather than substance. Not only are the young people today less mature, they are also very pop-culture oriented, easily persuaded by candidates who may be popular rather than good with high quality, which will reduce the quality of the votes overall, and distort the candidate's focus, ladies and gentlemen. And on the second level of analysis, the majority of young people today do not care about political substance. We demand that the proposition show us an uprising among young people in Korea to get the voting age lowered. Without this, how can they prove the political will among 18-year-olds? Is there a clear, measurable standard for determining the level of political participation and willingness among the youth? I say there isn't. And finally, to my third argument. The opposition brings you an alternative that can effectively solve the problem, as opposed to the harmful proposition plan. The counterplan is a compulsory voting clause in the law plus various measures to increase participation, such as voters' education, guaranteed government subsidy on candidate platforms, media broadcasted debates, \"Get out the Vote\" campaigns, and et cetera. What is needed is more people voting wisely, not a lowering voting age. The compulsory voting clause will bring clearly increased participation regardless of enforcement. In Thailand, this is not enforced, but even if it wasn't enforced, the voting rates rose by about 15% after the clause was established. And in Uruguay, it was enforced, and the voting rate soared from 67% to 88.2%. So it is clear that the benefits are existent whether you enforce it or not, and the government can choose enforcement. But either way, the clause plus the supplemented participation measures, such as Bush's \"Get out the Vote\" movement, will be successful. Because of these reasons, I ask you in this round to oppose this motion.

Content: We Would All be Better off if the Drinking Age were 18 \"I think we would all be better off if the drinking age were 18,\" says the President of Dartmouth College, Dr. James Wright. He remembers the days before the drinking age was raised to 21. At that time academic departments had open house and served sherry, students commonly gathered with faculty with drinks. Dr. Wright says \"I think it's unfortunate we find ourselves in the position that we enforce a law that most of us believe doesn't treat students as adults.\" 1 President Wright emphasizes that \"if the nation could send 18-year-olds to Iraq and if the College could send its students to off-campus programs in places where drinking was not regulated below age 21, then it should be deemed reasonable that students be able to drink legally at age 18 in the United States. Consider the fallacy of the prohibition that now governs almost every U.S. institution of higher learning. At freshman orientation, half of the students are already \"regular\" drinkers by some definition. The newcomers immediately become members of a peculiarly narrow community. Almost everyone is within a five-year age bracket. Through fraternities, sororities, other social organizations, dating, and less formal socializing, this narrow age group (18-22) thoroughly intermingles. Yet in any social setting where alcohol is present, the law says those 21 and older may drink beer, wine and distilled spirits in unlimited quantities as long as they do not drive or appear intoxicated in public; those age 20 years, 364 days or younger must stick with soft drinks or become lawbreakers. Should anyone be surprised that zero tolerance is met with rebellion and rule breaking? Outlandish behavior is a typical reaction to prohibition, which is why the illegal speakeasies were always bawdier than the public bars that the Volstead Act shut down. The modern age-based prohibition seems to be working no better than the 1920s version; while a smaller percentage of young adults are now drinking, a sizable minority is drinking recklessly. Is there a ready solution? We offer one for consideration and debate: a provisional drinking license. The current United States legal drinking age is 21. Many United States citizens disagree with this age. Many believe that the age to legally be able to purchase, consume or possess alcohol should be 18. A United States Citizen is allowed to vote when they are 18 years of age. 18 year old males are forced to join the Selective Service, for possible drafting. This means that 18-year old males can go to war. At age 18, a citizen is also inclined to jury duty. So, an 18-year old is given the responsibilities of voting, being selected for jury duty, and possibly being drafted for war. If an 18-year old citizen is to be given these responsibilities, why is the legal drinking age 21? Does the U.S. Government not trust those of us under 21? They trust us with their votes, yet they cannot treat us like full adults for another 3 years! Surely that does not seem such as justice. When drinking is legal, it takes place in the open, where it can be supervised by police, security guards and even health-care workers. When the drinking age went up, the spigot wasn't turned off, it was simply moved underground--to homes or cars or frat-house basements--where no adult could keep an eye on things. When kids who are drinking on the sly do venture out, they often \"pre-load\" first, fueling up on as much alcohol as they can hold before the evening begins so that the buzz lasts as long as possible. As for the reduction in traffic fatalities? Skeptics believe it may have less to do with changing the drinking age than with the new mores about drunk driving and the more aggressive enforcement of DUI laws. It works in other countries A good example is United Kingdom. The legal drinking age is 18 years for purchasing these alcoholic beverages however; they can drink this when they are only 5 years old with permission of their parents. Most countries have a legal drinking age of 18 years but there are several countries in Europe with a lower drinking age of 16 years old like Belgium, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Italy and some others. There are even countries with no legal drinking age at all like Armenia and some others. The laws are changing all the time and it should be wise to have the same legal drinking age in all the countries of the world. The United States may already be lowering the drinking age \" all quoted from article \" Despite the risk of penalties, however, seven US states are exploring lowering the drinking age - partly for under-age Iraq war vets and more broadly in recognition that teenagers are going to drink anyway. \"If you can take a shot on the battlefield you ought to be able to take a shot of beer legally,\" said Fletcher Smith, who has sponsored legislation to lower the drinking age in South Carolina. Kentucky, Wisconsin, and South Carolina have introduced legislation to lower the drinking age for troops to 18. Four other states - Missouri, South Dakota, Minnesota, and most recently Vermont - would extend the privilege to the general population. However, South Dakota would only allow 18-20 year olds to buy low-alcohol beer. Advocates of a lower drinking age argue that teenagers are drinking, and that the secrecy encourages binge drinking among young people. \"Our laws aren't working. They're not preventing underage drinking. What they're doing is putting it outside the public eye,\" Hinda Miller, a Vermont state senator, told reporters yesterday, after a committee took up her bill to study lowering the drinking age. \"So you have a lot of kids binge drinking. They get sick, they get scared and they get into trouble and they can't call because they know it's illegal.\" http://www.guardian.co.uk... \"back to my words\" so, it works in other countries, you can vote, you can go to war, it is under consideration, and the already started rebellion would be quelled.

The proposition side has, firstly, said that in nowdays, students are very so smart that they can choose the president wisely. She also said some points from Dr. Sam. However, it cannot be true. First of all, she did not state the exact source and did not explain who Dr. Sam is. Second of all, she said about the studies and being smart. On the other hand, study does not really affect voting quality. For example, somebody who is very bad at study can choose the president very wisely. Even it is true, she did not tell us why it is. Also, she said most of the students are smart in these days, but does that mean the minorities are not people? Although there might be many students who are smart, what about the rest of the others who are NOT smart? Secondly, she has told us that if students can vote at the younger age, it can be their habit which can increase the voting turnout. In contrast, it is not always necessarily true. In 2007, the voting age has been already lowered from 20 to 19. However, in the latest Presidential Election, it showed the lowest voters turnout- It was shown that only 60% of the total voters had voted for the election. It finally means that lowering the voting age does not affect people for increasing voting turnout. It only gets decreased more. Now, I would like to ask MickeyMouse these questions: 1. Do you believe that 18-year-olds make better political decisions than the most mature in society, such as 50-year-old businessmen? 2. The Korean Constitution states that you are an adult when you are 20 years old and that when you're 19 years old, you can have certain political and business rights. So what do you think about that? What is your basis for saying that the standard of an adult is 18 years old in Korea? 3. Even 18-year-olds cannot set up their own businesses, they cannot invest, they cannot vote, they cannot participate in political parties, and such. So, how can you say that those who are younger than 19 year old actually do have these valid social experiences that you need for the basis of voting? 4. Do you have clear and objective standard for maturity? Moving onto my summary, I would like to emphasize, again, my points. First, people whose ages are under 19 are not really mature and they do not have any valid social experience. Those who are younger than 19, still have to be taken care of by older adults. Thus, they are not independent, which means that they are too immature to participate in election. Second, young people mostly like style better than substances. They do not really care about the quality of the candidates, but care about being stylish. It is because they are pop-oriented. So, they can choose the president wisely since they do not consider about what should be considered about. Lastly, it is because of the purpose. What we seriously need to talk about is more people voting good-quality president, not lowering the voting age. Lowering the voting age, does not really mean choosing a wise president. So, therefore, because we live in the country called Korea, where the age is 19, we believe that we should run away from the international trend unless we change the Constitution. We live in a society where the cultural basis of an adult is 19 years old. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we beg this motion does not pass.

Kids Voting is a program in which children participate in a mock vote and accompany their parents to the polls on Election Day. Reports show that even this modest gesture to including youth increased the interest in voting of their whole family. Parents were more likely to discuss politics with their kids and thus an estimated 600,000 adult voters were more likely to vote because of it.

It' s very nice to see you guys again. Well, Jane I am enjoying this debate too. Before going to my arguments, I would like to answer the question that Jane ask to me. 1.Yes I think so. As many people said our children such as high students or universities, are becoming smarter and smarter. Of course 50 years old business man keep more experience than 18years old students but I don't think that experience and voting has no relationship. 2.Sorry, Jane I remember that I didn't said that over 18 is a adults.:) 3.Even though they didn't experience, I heard in school, teacher tell them how to choose good president for our county. Plus, they have voting a president is their classroom, right? And they can experience many times to choose good president of Korea. Well, now I'm going to move to my arguments. Well, I'm going to give you guys a example of Americans just like all other Americans, young Americans pay taxes. In fact, they pay a lot of taxes. According to the IRS, teens pay an estimated $9.7 Billion dollars in sales taxes alone, not to mention many millions of taxes on income. \"You may be a teen, you may not even have a permanent job, but you have to pay taxes on the money you earn.\" Youth pay billions in taxes to state, local, and federal governments yet they have absolutely no say over how much is taken. This is what the American Revolution was fought over; this is taxation without representation. In addition to being affected by taxes, young people are affected by every other law that Americans live under. As fellow citizens in this society, every action or inaction taken by lawmakers affects youth directly, yet they have no say in the matter. According to a study conducted by Dr. Frank Smearing of the University of Chicago, he found that \"Between 1992 and 1995, forty American states relaxed the requirements for transferring an accused under the maximum age of jurisdiction into criminal court,\" and \"In Colorado, for example, defendants under the maximum age for juvenile court jurisdiction may nonetheless be charged by direct filing in criminal court if they are over 14 years of age and are charged with one of a legislative list of violent crimes.\" What kind of message do we send when we tell youth they are judged as mature, responsible adults when they commit murder, but silly, brainless kids when they want to vote? This is a double standard, no different than during the Vietnam War. War isn't a dead issue now either, leaders who youth can't vote for today may send them to war tomorrow. Lowering the voting age is the fair and correct way to set things straight. Thirdly, today\u00a2&;\u00e7&castle;s politicians represent various constituencies. As of today, young people are no one's constituency. Why should politicians care about the needs and wishes of youth when they have no ability to vote for or against them? Politicians have no motivation whatsoever. Lowering the voting age will give politicians a real reason to respect the desires of young people. The words spoken before the Senate Judicatory Committee supporting lowering the voting age in 1971 are as true then as they are now, \"The anachronistic voting-age limitation tends to alienate them [the youth] from systematic political processes and to drive them to into a search for an alternative, sometimes violent, means to express their frustrations over the gap between the nation's deals and actions. Lowering the voting age will provide them with a direct, constructive and democratic channel for making their views felt and for giving them a responsible stake in the future of the nation.\" In conclusion, every person in the United States is born with the individual responsibility to be active in the political process. Without allowing youth to vote, we can\u00a2&;\u00e7&castle;t expect teenagers to care for the political process.

Content: I'd like to start off with a simple: Hello, people. Welcome to this debate. At this moment, I am hoping that anyone will accept this debate. Thank you, to the person that does. I'd like to start off by saying that 16 year olds are mature. This debate is about the rights of 16-ers. If they are old enough to have jobs and have sex, then they are certainly old to make educated decisions about things that will have a big impact on their future. This is taxation without representation. According to the IRS, American teenagers are responsible for 9.7 billion dollars in sales taxes alone, not to mention the amount of taxes on income! I quote: \"Youths pay billions in taxes to state, local, and federal governments yet they have absolutely no say over how much is taken\" or what is done with this money. I repeat: this is taxation without representation. The least we can do is to lower the voting age so that 16 and 17 year olds have a say. Policies such as minimum wage, working hours, and conditions are also determined by governments. If 16 year olds are old enough to have jobs, then they are old enough to be able to vote on things that will affect their future. I conclude this point by stating that 16 years of age, you can get a job. You also pay taxes, as stated before. It is undemocratic that you have no say in who manages and sets these taxes. The Opposition may state that young people are not so well-informed. Well, they aren't well informed because they can't vote! If they cannot participate in a voting, what makes you think they will have the motivation to learn? They won't. Therefore, by lowering the voting age, teenagers will learn and be educated about politics at a younger age. A good example is \"Kid's Voting.\" This is a simulation where children participate in a mock voting, such as the one held at my school, JM. Reports show that this activity increased the interest of voting in entire families! More parents discussed politics with their kids and were more likely to vote because of this. An estimated 600,000 adults were more likely to vote, according to the New York Times. I would also like to point out that students are learning much about politics in school, which also helps them to make more informed decisions. I'd like to sum up this argument by saying that this strengthens democracy and helps both adults and kids to make more educated votes. This is a new incentive for the public to become knowledgeable. What the Opposition is likely to do is to exaggerate the chances of these kids being influenced by the 3 Ps: Peers, pressure, and parents. I'd like to point out, judge, that these are not 13 year-olds. These teenagers are 16 years of age. They are mature, their bodies are adult, they have experience, and they have been educated for at least 10 years. If 16-ers are old enough to have a job, and have sex, they are certainly old enough to control their life, according to the International Debate and Education Association. There are just as many people out there who are uneducated about politics as there are who are educated. Let's think about it this way: if you are uneducated about politics, that means you don't care. And if you don't care; why should you vote? You see, people, according to the New York Times, many kids who don't know enough about what they are voting on actually don't vote. This means that there is less of a chance of the uneducated people voting. I'm going to remind everyone of my arguments: I. This is taxation without representation. One of the same things the Revolutionary War was fought over. This is a democratic country: it includes 16 year olds because they pay taxes and they have jobs. II. Younger people are well-informed. However, there are some that are not well-informed. If we lower the voting age, then it will give them a reason to become well-informed. III. 16-ers are not 13 year-olds. They are mature and have control over their life. If we can trust them to handle a job, we can trust them to withstand pressure and make the right decision. IV. Most uneducated people don't care and therefore don't vote. Guys, these are mature teenagers with control over their life and their job. They pay taxes. They have sex. They can make the right decision.

REBUTTALS1. Legal Adulthood is 18 in USWhile legal adulthood is 18 in the US, the age of full brain development does not come until one's twenties. \"They have the right to vote in an election and enlist in the army. It is only right that they should be allowed to take the responsibility of alcohol.\" These two arguments are not related to drug use, the intaking of alcohol. As I proved in my previous arguments, alcohol use physically affects the bodies of younger drinkers more than it does to older adults. Voting does not pose any immediate physical affects to the body. Yes, 18 year olds can fight for our country and take a bullet, but that is not drug related. 18 year olds are much more likely to die as a result of alcohol abuse or DUI than being shot while serving in the military. 5000 underage drinkers die every year as a result of alcohol, and 190,000 underage drinkers are hospitilized every year from alcohol related incidents.[1] The number of deaths of 18-20 year olds serving in the military are too low to compare. 2. Underage drinkers drink more for the thrillPro has falied to prove that alcohol \"being hard to get\" is the main factor in heavy underage drinking. Since Pro's argument here is opinionated, I will give my opinions as well. There are better alternatives in teaching underage drinkers the effects of alcohol by just letting them drink however much they want. Alcohol consumption and moderation should be taught by teachers and parents, not first hand experimentation. 3. People still drink alcoholPeople still get drunk at bars and other public places, even at the legal age. Allowing young adults to drink in public does not mean that they will not abuse alcohol.\"The law is unenforceable.\"Actually, it is enforceable. You must provide a valid ID to show that you are at least 21 years old in order to purchase alcohol. Drinking and driving underage has more consequences than drinking and driving at legal age. If someone breaks the law by drinking underage, it's called breaking the law. Yes, young adults are still able to drink alcohol. Someone underage being able to drink alcohol does not show that therefore the drinking age should be lowered if underage drinkers want to drink anyway. 4. SourcesThis is a rebuttal regarding Pro's sources. First source: Shows the pros and cons to lowering the drinking age, so it works in my favor as well. Third source: Same as above. Those two sources do not give your argument the edge over the cons to lowering the drinking age, they just show the pros and cons. By just listing the pros from a website that shows pros and cons, you are not arguing for the lowering of the drinking age, you are showing the pros which would leave the voters to vote based on their own opinions as to whether they agree with the pros or the cons.SOURCES [1] http://www.niaaa.nih.gov...", "qid": 48, "docid": "ed9141f0-2019-04-18T15:53:35Z-00000-000", "score": 7.664299964904785}, {"content": "Title: Youth Suffrage? should we lower the voting age.

Con case If you recall in my first argument I mentioned that to win my opponent must provide reasoning that demonstrates why 18 year olds differ enough from 17 year olds in such a way as to justify denying them the vote. Let\u2019s see if he has done that. 1: \u201cUniformed Voters\u201d Essentially con\u2019s contention here is against uneducated voting, not voting age. Last round he attempted to argue that he has shown that it is a larger issue for those under 18, though all he showed was that it is an issue, not a larger issue for the age group. In fact I can show this via my opponent\u2019s own words. \u201cHigh school seniors are usually between the ages of 17 and 18. \u201d My opponent has just affirmed that his stat reasonably applies to 17 and 18 year olds alike and thus this contention does nothing to negate lowering the voting age to 17. It is therefore off topic and ought not be weighed against the resolution. 2: \u201cPropaganda\u201d This contention addresses the issue of misinformation and voter manipulation. Con does claim that teens are likely easier to manipulate, though as with the last contention; this would include eighteen and nineteen year olds. Thus, we see this contention also does not really address why those that are 18 should vote and those 17 ought not. This contention is therefore not well established to be against the resolution so much as voting itself and ought not be weighed against the resolution. 3: \u201cCounter Plan\u201d Con\u2019s alternative was for an observable metric to determine voter competence. I mentioned that this is reminiscent of Jim Crow Laws. It seems my reference here was misunderstood. I was saying that having some kind of intelligence test or metric to determine voter competence has been found to be easily used to oppress minorities. For example; Jim Crow laws. As Con has provided no kind of specifics, it is impossible for me to attack whatever metric he is referring to. Thus, my contention was that when such \u201cmetrics\u201d have been used in the past, they have been used to oppress minorities. Final thoughts on Con\u2019s Case My opponents contentions and counter plan miss the mark. We are discussing whether voting should be extended to 17 year olds. Nothing in Con\u2019s case demonstrates support for the status quo which allows those the age of 18 to vote and not allow those 17 to vote. He has thus not justified denying the vote to 17 year olds specifically. My case I presented the simple concept that This Democratic Republic was established \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people. \u201d At the time this government was established, it was a radical change from the governments that preceded it. We the people of the U. S. are to have a voice. We are to be able to elect our own representatives. Con claims that this claim points toward a utilitarian framework. It does, it appeals to the greatest possible good being liberty of the people to choose outweighing the so called benefits of tyranny. Con\u2019s claims his counterplan solves the problem I brought up. I am not sure how he sees that being the case. His counter plan seems to more than likely limit liberty not oppress it. I have shown that the difference between 17 and 18 year olds is virtually nonexistent and thus no reason there to give 18 year olds the power to vote and restrict 17 year olds. Con claims that 17 year olds ability to conscript in the military does not qualify them for the vote. If con was aware of history he would see that is the main reason 18 year olds were given the vote. During Vietnam 18 year olds could be drafted but not vote. It was argued that such an arrangement that allows you to die for your country but have no representation way tyrannical. Con again cites his stat concerning high school seniors. Again I will point out this stat also includes those who have the ability currently to vote. I also briefly argued that taxation without representation was tyrannical. He concedes this but says it does not affect his framework. Apparently con feels as though his framework is the end all be all of this debate. Though, he never addressed my framework. Clearly, I argued that what ought to be valued is liberty and what ought to be avoided is tyranny. My opponent needed to provide reasoning that demonstrated why 18 year olds differ enough from 17 year olds in such a way as to justify denying them the vote. He has not done so. I have shown, the difference in age between the two is negligible and thus those who have reached the age of 17 ought to be able to vote for the president that will represent them the next four years.

Content: I apologize to my opponent and the audience for not posting up my source. Here it is: http://debatewise.org... Before I begin my refutation, is any vote really wrong? We cannot say that a teenager will vote for someone because they are misinformed, and that it is the wrong vote. An 18 year old, can be misinformed about politics. A citizen of any age can be misinformed. So why, is it to fall upon the 16 year olds, that they cannot vote because they are misinformed? No vote, is the wrong vote. Now, I'd like to continue with refuting all my opponents points. In my opponent's first point, he stated that \"16 year olds are not mature enough to vote\". IF they are not mature enough to vote, then how is it they are mature enough to pay taxes, get married, and leave home? All of these things require more maturity than voting. In his second contention, he stated that not everybody needs to vote. Of course not everybody needs to vote, yet THIS debate is about 16 year olds. He then listed examples of toddlers voting. I'd like to remind him that this debate is about 16 year olds, and not toddlers. Therefore his point is irrelevant and has no further use. In his third contention, he stated that more maturity develops when you're 16-18. He then stated the things that develop the maturity, such as a driver's license, or the ability to go to college. How does this develop the maturity required for voting? After all, no vote is the wrong vote. Gaining a driver's license is not going to have a critical effect, on the person's political party and who they want to vote for. Obviously, my opponents point has no meaning. Now, onto my points. Let me ask you, do we deny the vote to mentally challenged people? Do we deny the vote to people that are completely drunk and stoned out of their minds? Of course we don't, because they are over 18! Tell me, should we allow retarded citizens to vote, yet deny tax paying citizens the right? Many people have no real idea about politics. 16-year-olds who care enough to vote are just as likely to understand politics as those who already have the vote. Again, to follow this point to its logical extreme, we should return to a system where only well-educated people can vote, something that was abandoned as classist and backward a hundred years ago. Voting at 16 offers an opportunity for young people to inject more passion and energy into the political system. Young people are motivated by exactly the same issues as older voters, public safety, taxation and the cost of transport there is a lack of evidence that 16 and 17 year olds are more impressionable in their voting habits than others. The limit of 18 is ultimately arbitrary. Previous to the voting age being lowered to 18, the voting age was 21. The reasons cited for this higher age boundary were exactly the same arguments as are being used by those who oppose lowering the voting age to 16, namely that the individuals would be too immature or ignorant to use their vote wisely. As we have seen, 18 year olds are just as capable of making informed democratic choices as 21 year olds, and there isn't any magical transformative process which occurs between 16 and 18 which turns individuals into fully fledged democratic citizens. Rather, maturity occurs on a spectrum, and as will be outlined below, some 16 year olds may be equally or better informed about politics than people much their senior who have the vote. More to the point, there are many things which 16 year olds are deemed by the state to be mature enough to do. For example, you can marry, leave full time education, leave home, and get a full time job, all of which are serious responsibilities. More seriously than that, at 16 one can volunteer for military service, and it seems implausible to claim that one can be simultaneously mature enough to volunteer to fight for one's country yet immature enough to vote.

I am excited to debate this issue for many reasons: my primary one, however, is because I have not debated in a long time and this looks like a good debate to get myself back in gear. It is an interesting idea, and you make some pretty interesting points. However, I feel I can counter them, and provide a few good reasons of my own for why the voting age should be lowers, or, at least, why eighteen year olds are no more responsible or mature than a sixteen or seventeen year old. I know that this will fulfill my burden of proof, but it will at least, hopefully, show why your arguments are not quite as good as you may believe them to be, in my opinion. That being said, let's start with rebuttals! Rebuttal 1: Maturity My primary issues with this point are that you have not provided statistical support for your claim, and you are begging the question. You are basing your reasoning behind why you believe eighteen year olds are more mature than sixteen year olds on things such as military age. However, this conclusion is under the assumption that eighteen year olds are mature enough to join the military, or that sixteen year olds are not mature enough to. The primary reason why the age to join the military is eighteen and not sixteen is because most sixteen year olds are in high school. This is not a problem of maturity, but a problem of circumstance. Of course, I can also turn this argument around and say that, because sixteen year olds are mature enough to own and drive a car, they should be allowed to vote. I am sure you disagree with this reasoning: but why? It is the same reasoning you are using with why they should not; I'm only turning it on its head. In fact, you made this point for me! \u201cIf 18 year olds are not yet mature enough to walk into a pub how can they be mature enough to decide the future of an entire country.\u201d I would hardly say that the amount of teenagers paying taxes is low: \u201cAt any given time approximately 45% of 16-17 year olds will be working and up to 80% of all teens will have a job before they graduate from high school. \u201d (1) If you have a job, even as a teenager, you pay taxes. That does not even take into account the fact that teens overall spent an estimated 9.7 billion in sales taxes alone! (2) Our brain is not fully developed until we hit thirty. Indeed. Are you arguing that we should increase the voting system, then, to 30? Rebuttal 2: Experience Why would you not trust a sixteen year old with your life? What about a sixteen year old makes them more untrustworthy than an eighteen year old? Furthermore, sixteen year olds cannot run for office. This is true. However, neither can an eighteen year old. Can you guess what the youngest age you can be to run for any political office in the United States of America? 25. (3) Are you arguing that we should raise the age to 25? But they are not fully developed themselves; so, 30? Yes, most 16 or 17 year olds have not had a long-term job or have run their own lives. But neither will an 18 year old: in fact, most people will not have this responsibility until they leave college, which is usually around 22 (given that post people finish college with a bachelor's degree). This is not even mentioning the fact that, whoever is on the ballot, adults will vote for at the same percentage as children. If children can vote bad, than adults can vote bad as well. There is no objectively wrong vote, though; one's opinion is their own. Your basic argument regarding the whole untrustworthy children when it comes to making decisions is one that can be applied to any adult. After all, I wouldn't trust just any adult with my life. Sixteen year olds would have the same options as adults. Rebuttal 3: Responsibility That logic is just silly. You must prove that a sixteen year old cannot fulfill the role of a juryman. The primary reason they are not is, once again, a problem of circumstance: being on jury requires that you miss school. Furthermore, juryman are decided based on voting registrars; you have to vote to be a part of a jury! So, this begs the question: 16 or 17 year olds cannot vote because they cannot be juryman because they cannot vote. This is circular logic. Point 1: No taxation without representation It is what the founding fathers fought for: teenagers pay quite a bit in taxes, as I have already pointed out in rebuttal one. As such, they deserve the same level of representation as others who pay taxes. Indeed, they may not pay the same amount in taxes as everybody else, but circumstances have always been a factor in what taxes are given to what people. After all, 47% of people do not pay income tax, because of age or socioeconomic standing (most are elderly or poor, or both). Point 2: Stability Sixteen and seventeen are good times to vote, stability-wise. Eighteen is one of the worst times, in fact. Sixteen and seventeen year olds are stationary; they attend school and have a regular social life. They have no real major changes that affect their lives. However, eighteen year olds are generally transitioning to colleges, attempting to find stable employment, and sometimes trying to find a place to live. This is also a time of economic instability: after all, college is significantly more expensive than anything you'll need to pay for in high school, and those who do not go to college still need to find a way to sustain themselves outside of their parent's homes. They are still trying to settle down. Point 3: Voter Turnout Voter turnout will increase if you lower the voting age. Studies such as Merrill's study of five states that had implemented a program called Kids Voting USA, which gives children information on voting and politics, and five states that did not implement the program. He found that parent turnout increased three percent, due to parents being inspired to vote due to their kid's enthusiasm to voting. The number was as high as nine percent in some states! (4) It would be logical, therefore, that voter turnout would increase in both children and adults if the voting age was lowered. Point 4: Unique point of view Voters will, obviously, vote based on their circumstances in life. As teenagers have a different point of view as, say, a mentally senile seventy-three year old man (who has just as much right to vote as a mentally stable thirty year old), they will provide a unique point of view to the election. Along with that, their views will be heard and considered by politicians when they make political decisions that affect things such as education and raising or lowing minimum wage, as just a few examples. Conclusion I eagerly await my opinion's response. This was a lot of fun! Best of luck to my opponent; his opinions are interesting, but I am curious of his actual position: is he in favor of keeping the minimum age of voting at eighteen? Or is he in favor of increasing the voting age? Based on what he said, it seems like the latter. If that is the case, this should be a very interesting debate indeed.

Content: This is a topic I enjoy debating, and I am thankful to be on the Con stance. So going on to the actual debate portion, For maximum clarity, I will refute the Pro stance and then present a few points advocating the Con stance. Pro- 1. To every argument there must be claim/ warrant/ and impact. and while this argument my opponent is presenting here has all three of these essential components, they don't do much to prove that we should lower the legal drinking age. He is simply saying \"they do it anyway, so let them do it\" however it is not the most morally acceptable thing to do. If there where a spree of murders would we emphasize this laissez faire attitude? absolutely not! so unless my opponent provides a better reason to advocate his stance, we must not accept it; we must preserve moral integrity, as it makes us human. 2. Here, my opponent is making the same exact argument in a new guise; now he's implying that we need to lower the drinking age to 18 simply \"they're getting caught\" if some-one close to you was consistently getting caught for doing something wrong, you would not just say, \"Well legalize what they're doing so they wouldn't get in trouble\" you would try and help them. the fact that these under-age drinkers are continuing to drink is not a sign that we need to just lower the drinking age, but it is a sign we must more closely enforce the laws regarding drink. as for drunk driving; it will always happen, in fact if we give 18 year old's the ability to legally drink it will just raise the drunken driving rate. People will see that it's legal for them to drink (these people who are not yet fully developed mentally) and they after drinking, they'll drive anyway. 3. This is also a fallacy, it's a simple truth that Drinking is considered taboo. It's not something deemed very societally appropriate. humans are creatures of rebellion, and lowering the drinking age would only make the forbidden fruit more appetizing because these teenagers would see their friends who where only slightly older than them doing it, and they too would have this desire to consume alcohol. there would be no change for the better; only change for the worse. and so now that we see the Pro stance does not work, let's proceed to the Con's stance Con- for the sake of Character usage, I will not be sourcing my points with evidence. but if so requests I will post my sources in the comment section. 1. The brain is not fully developed until the ages of between 21 and 25- Accordingly these young adults won't be able to drink responsibly, their having a buzz will prohibit proper self-control. I am not trying bash those younger than the age of 21, I fall under this category. I am simply saying that the human mind does not reach complete cognitive development until between these ages. so by allowing people younger than the age of 21 to drink alcohol, you ultimately doom them to make poor decision. 2. Newly legal adults need time to adapt and adjust to living on their own before being allowed such a vice into their lives- This is true universally and can be applied to almost any situation, if all power is give to a person at once, they have no reason to practice self-control. In the United States, at the age of 18, people are considered adults. but not yet do they have the full rights of this title but in every step of human growth, we inch into the next level there are still many restrictions they must adhere. not to mention at the age of eighteen many people are still high school. by voting for the Pro, we allow our children to exposed to alcohol. 3. Alcohol kills brain cells which stunt mental development- between ages 18-20 and even beyond that many adults go to college to better themselves, alcohol limits them, and lessens their potential. (I spoke briefly about this in my first point) and despite what my opponent would have you believe in his first point, college is not some huge party where every waking moment is flooding with alcohol. it's all a matter of who you surround yourself with. when I was in high school, I didn't drink. it wasn't even a problem. Now that I'm in college I can assure you, that avoiding alcohol hasn't been much of a problem here either. and so the Conclusion, my Coup De Gras; we must look toward the Con stance. the Pro does not solve for any kind of issue by lowering the Legal Drinking age, nor does he provide any kind of moral reasoning for why it ought to be lowered. essentially he provides absolutely no reason for why you need to vote for the Him. while on the inverse I show how lowering the Legal Drinking age would have an adverse affect on society. I talk about human development and show only a few of the many great implications that would come with Lowering the Legal Drinking Age.

No, they are not.

You are only allowed to be part of a jury when you are 18 and older, making the decision that could change someone's life forever.

Second my opponent claims they're where actually trying to advocate that the legal drinking age should be lowered not heightened (as I would assume they where) But the attack they made toward me in this regard is not synonymous with this desire; they've made a grave mistake which will cost them the round. Third, most people have their entire lives to be primed to join the military. at young ages feelings of patriotism are instilled within them. by the age of eight most people have fully developed their moral standing (which granted can change over time) whereas drinking is not primarily an issue of morality, but of pleasure. fourth, my opponent only proves that alcohol kills brain cells, he does not prove the drinking age should be lowered; but instead this logic points that we ought to abolish drinking all together. and if you know your history, that would lead to mass crime. so in closing, I urge to vote for the Con, as my opponent utterly fails to prove their point that we should lower the drinking age, but instead spent their time between bashing the military men and women who give up their lives for the protection of the american people, and advocating the ill-effects of drinking. through no logic my opponent has presented should the drinking age be lowered, but instead their logic gives the idea that the drinking age should be heightened, and that we should abolish the military.

Legal age for adulthood should be reduced in the United States. Content: \"A child becomes an adult when he realizes he has a right not only to be right but also to be wrong. \" Because I agree with these words of Hungarian psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, and because I figured that out before I was 18, I support the resolution, which states: RESOLVED: Legal age for adulthood should be reduced in the United States. Before I begin, I offer the following DEFINITIONS to clarify the round: LEGAL AGE: the age at which a person acquires full legal rights and responsibilities ADULTHOOD: the state (and responsibilities) of a person who has attained maturity SHOULD: must; ought (used to indicate duty, propriety, or expediency) REDUCED: brought down to a smaller extent, size, amount, number, etc. (all defined from . http://www.Dictionary.com...) Move with me now to the RESOLUTION ANALYSIS, an explanation and evaluation of the topic: 1. The \"legal age\" is the age at which a person in the U. S. receives full legal rights. However, in these fifty nifty states not all rights are acquired on the same birthday. Indeed, if all rights were taken into consideration, the legal age might be 55 (when you can order Senior Citizen Specials at Perkins). But a good portion of these rights (pornography, voting, military, smoking, gambling, etc. ) are officially set at age 18. Therefore, I shall assume that by \"the legal age,\" the resolution means 18, and I shall concentrate my entire case on the legal rights attained at that age. 2. The resolution does not specify what the new legal age should be, nor does it mandate that the PRO provide a specific new legal age. The debate is only about the merits and drawbacks of a lowered legal age. If the CON requires a specific age, let's just say I advocate moving it from 18 to 16. With these standards for debate set, we can now move on to CONTENTIONS, the meat and potatoes of the case. My position will be split up into three points: I: THE LEGAL AGE IS INTENDED AS A SIGN OF MATURITY. Like membership in an exclusive club, the legal age is a criterion which determines the eligibility of a person to receive some right or privilege. Legal age is an imaginary line that separates the men from the boys (or the women from the girls) in regards to a certain right. For example, a six-year-old child probably could not responsibly gamble, but a 32-year-old probably could. By defining the legal age for gambling (and other rights) at 18, the government's goal is to express that a person below that age is immature, while a person above that age is mature (in terms of the right in question). II: THIS STANDARD OF MATURITY IS CONTRADICTORY. Unfortunately, this maturity standard is rife with contradiction. Instead of having a clearly defined standard of what constitutes maturity in terms of age, the government has blurred the imaginary line to the point where it is virtually unrecognizable. There are two reasons for this, which I shall label \"A\" and \"B. \" A: The legal age has exceptions. The legal age for joining the military is 18 in general (no pun intended). However, this age does not truly represent a level of maturity, because 17-year-olds can still join the military with parental consent. If the legal age truly measured maturity, this exception would not be allowed. Another exception of the legal age is emancipation. Emancipation is a legal process by which a minor may sever all (or most) ties with their parents. While parental consent is required for students under 18 years of age for many different rights, this criterion is removed when the parents no longer have legal authority over their child. By the defined legal age, emancipated minors would still be considered immature and ineligible for the rights of an 18-year-old, but by the current legal process many of these rights become available. In both of these cases, the legal age fails to assign maturity uniformly. The imaginary line that individuals cross in the process of maturing is lowered in special cases, with no actual test to determine whether the person whom the bar is lowered for is mature enough to handle these rights. This creates a contradiction, and makes the legal age an illegitimate requirement. B: More serious rights have lower levels of maturity than less serious rights. In most states, the legal age for applying for a driver's license is 16, but it ranges from 17 (in New Jersey) to 14 \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd (in my homeland, the Dakotas). In any case, the legal age for this right is lower than the legal age for most other rights - 18. This is a massive error in judgment. The government assumes that a child is mature enough to handle a moving vehicle (which is rather difficult to learn, and can cause serious injury or death if used improperly) while at the same time immature with regards to voting (which has no dangers associated with it) or purchasing pornography (which, in a legal sense, is equally not dangerous). If we were to administer standards rationally, the legal age for driving would be equal to or higher than the legal age for other rights. All of these contradictions turn the legal age into a meaningless quantitative measure with no legitimacy. When a standard can be bent in special cases, and when the standard incorrectly assigns maturity for different rights, it is no standard at all. It is an antiquated and abused system that has failed its purpose of defining maturity in legal situations. III: THE LEGAL AGE SHOULD BE LOWERED TO CORRECT THESE CONTRADICTIONS. If the legal age for the rights given at 18 were lowered, we could remove these contradictions and re-establish the legal age as a level which would properly define and regulate maturity. All of these conflicting rights could be established at age 16, perhaps, and no exceptions would be allowed for military enlistment, emancipation, or anything else. The standard set by the government would finally have legitimacy to separate mature from immature and assign rights and responsibilities accordingly. For the above stated reasons, I support the lowering of the legal age.", "qid": 48, "docid": "12e9a897-2019-04-18T19:45:48Z-00004-000", "score": 7.511499881744385}, {"content": "Title: Lower the Voting Age Content: I think you are very focused on the idea that a percentage of people don't live long enough to vote.

Actually less than a fourth of teens have their own opinion...but, even if you don't buy the influence argument, teens still are not ready to vote.

Yes, it is true the brain is not developed (usually) until one's mid-20s. However, you do not seem to see the glaringly obvious problem with this argument: mainly, that 18 year olds do not fit this bracket either. As such, you seem to be arguing that 18 year olds are mature enough to handle voting, but use arguments against how 16 year olds should not be allowed to vote that negatively effect 18 year olds as well. Regarding schools, you seem to ignore two pretty obvious holes in this idea that 16 or 17 year olds should not be allowed to vote because they are still in school: firstly, you state later that whether or not they are in school is irrelevant, because they can leave school at age 16. As such, they must have the maturity to handle not being in school, by your own logic, correct? Secondly, 18 year olds oftentimes (especially in the UK) attend universities. As such, an 18 year old is bound by the same problem: they are still learning. Yes, they cannot join the army at age 16, but they are mature enough to pledge to enroll and take JROTC courses that train them in the same things they would be trained in as 18 year olds enrolling for the army. 16 year olds cannot walk into a bar, it is true. However, in the United States, neither can an 18 year old. This is different from someone from the United Kingdom, where the legal drinking age is 18 (and lower if in a household). Does that mean that the age of maturity differs between countries? Seems doubtful. It is a good point to say that teenagers are taught to drive. However, teenagers are taught to vote, as well. Not in a technical way, but they are taught political issues, the opinions of these issues, the outcome of many political ideas, and how the government and voting system works. We are taught this in the form of Civics classes and Government classes in schools. In fact, you learn Civics and Government more than you learn how to drive! You cannot use a lack of being taught as an argument, because it is simply not true. Rebuttal 2: ExperienceMost 18 year olds do not hold a stable job. Hell, most 25 year olds hold a stable job. Many people cannot hold a stable career until after college, which can last as long as four years time. You have not provided a reason why a 16 year old's lack of experience is any different from an 18 year old's lack of it. Teens are given experience in the adult world: as pointed out before, 80% of American teenagers have had a job and pay taxes before their graduations. Is having a job not experience? If not, how does an 18 year old who is has not left is parent's house, is going to college, and lacks a job have any more experience than the average 16 year old? Most do not sustain for themselves. Colleges provide cafeterias (which means they don't cook for themselves) and many parents provide their children with enough income to survive being outside of the house; as such, they do not need to get a job. On top of this, most colleges have roommate systems, meaning they are not living on their own. Rebuttal 3: ResponsibilityYes, their prefrontal cortex is not developed at that age. But, once again, the glaring hole appears: neither have the 18 year old's prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, peer pressure is a common human experience: it does not suddenly stop when you hit 18. Counter-Rebuttal 1: Taxation without representationIf they receive no representation in the form of democracy, than why tax them? That is all I am saying. I would also repeat that the same problem arises for an 18 year old, but I think you got the point by now. If a teenager is taxed, than they should have a say; it is why, for instance, a third of American colonists attempted to secede from Great Britain, as they were not given parliamentary representation despite paying off most of Britain's war debts. If they are not mentally developed enough to vote, what makes them mentally developed enough to be taxed? Or to have a job, for that matter? Counter-Rebuttal 2: StabilityYes, teens have no money pressures, live in shelter, and have few worries. As in, they have time and energy to sit down and reflect on their political opinions, and who is the right people to run the nation. This is opposed to an eighteen year old who is so worried about so many major changes going on in his or her life that they cannot simply sit down and reflect on who they think will be better, and will likely make worse decisions as a result. Indeed, people vote in the way that benefits them and for those who share their political beliefs. However, people who have an unstable life have no time to actually give this any thought. Counter-Rebuttal 3: Voter turnoutI was not so much saying that more teenagers would come out if they were allowed in earlier as I was that more parents would be inspired to vote, as the study suggested. I would disagree in saying that we are talking about adolescents: after all, my point is to lower the voting age. I can propose any lower age I feel is arguably sound. However, I am not mentally deficient: I would say 16 would be the lowest I would be willing to go. The program includes adolescents, and there is proof that more parents turn out when children (and adolescents) are excited or participating. As such, voter turnout would still increase. Counter-Rebuttal 4: Unique point of viewThey would provide the unique point of view of someone a part of the education system. They can provide a view on how to improve their education quality, for instance. As for money and finances, teens oftentimes have jobs as I have pointed out. They would provide the perspective of a youth just beginning in the workforce. Etc.

Content: I negate the resolution, \"the drinking age be lowered within the United States to 16 years while under the supervision of a parent or guardian and 18 years without supervision. \" -OBSERVATION- The goal of this debate should be to determine which solution (more relaxed policies on alcohol on the affirmative, or the status quo on the negative) will ameliorate society by effectively discouraging drinking and reducing the negative side effects associated with alcohol. If my opponent can prove that lowering the drinking age will reduce drinking, he has won. If I prove that lowering the drinking age will not improve the situation, I have won. -- CONTENTION: A lowered drinking age will encourage behavior that impedes the successful progress of society. By lowering the legal drinking age, the US government would be employing counterproductive policies. The goal of policy action with regard to the drinking age should always be to discourage and reduce drinking rates; however, it can be shown both empirically and logically that a lower drinking age will only spawn a rejuvenated and enlarged culture of drinking. This would have several dire and most concerning ramifications for the citizens of the United States. Empirically, the drinking age of 21 years old has been quite successful. The Washington Post of July 12th, 2009 cited a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry which reported that, because of the recently raised drinking age, \"\u2026young people more often have made the decision not to drink \u2026 when young people know that the law will be upheld, they adjust their behavior. \" [1] This is significant because it shows that the drinking age is a successful policy. Moreover, this means that a lower drinking age would be a highly negative turn of events for society. Medline Plus, a service of the US National Library of Medicine and of the National Institutes of Health, affirmed on September 18th, 2009 that, \"People who grew up in a place and time when they could legally buy alcohol before age 21 are more likely than others to be alcoholics or have a drug problem, even well into adulthood\u2026\" [2] This article cites research by Dr. Karen Norberg, a research instructor in psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis. Her recent study supported the hypothesis that drinking at an early age has profound, long-term detriments: she found through careful study that, \"\u2026people who had been allowed to buy liquor legally before age 21 were 33 percent more likely to have suffered from alcoholism in the year before they were surveyed. Drinking at a younger age also was found to increase the risk of abusing other drugs. Those allowed to drink legally before age 21 were 70 percent more likely to have had a problem with drugs than were those who had to wait until 21 to drink legally\u2026\" [2] Dr. Marc Galanter, director of the division of alcoholism and drug abuse at New York University School of Medicine, makes clear how serious this impact really is: \"Even in [people's] 40s and 50s, this impact was felt. \" [2] On top of the highly dangerous alcohol and drug problems set in motion by drinking at a young age, early use of alcohol makes teenagers more prone to activities resulting in unplanned and unwanted pregnancies. A study conducted by Angela Fertig of the University of Georgia found this year that, \"\u2026a lower drinking age increases risky sexual behavior among young people, and that leads to more unplanned pregnancies that result in premature birth and low birth weight \u2026 when it's easier for young people to get alcohol, birth outcomes are worse. \" [3] This is detrimental to the prosperity and high quality of life held dear by all Americans. This is significant because, \"Teenagers who get pregnant unexpectedly are less likely to receive good prenatal care and may not take as much interest in the child as someone who tried to get pregnant \u2026 As a result of these behaviors on the mom's part, the child ends up with worse outcomes. \" [3] The use of alcohol by young Americans is a serious problem that must be addressed; however, as I have shown, the drinking age of 21 is the best way we currently have to combat substance abuse and teenage pregnancy. -REFUTATIONS- I. My opponent's first contention is that Americans who are old enough to serve in the armed forces should similarly be allowed to use alcohol. He seems to believe that it would be beneficial to our servicemen and women to be allowed to drink. I have two responses to this argument: A. There are unique harms associated with drinking at an early age that are not present in military service at a young age. That is, military service is equally dangerous whether a soldier is 18 or 25 years old; on the other hand, drinking at age 18 is much more harmful than drinking at age 25. This is shown quite clearly in the Norberg and Fertig studies I cited in my argument. Therefore, it is logically reasonable to prevent teenagers from consuming harmful substances while not impeding their service to our country. B. If there is indeed a problem, it is not a problem with the drinking age, but rather with the minimum age of eligibility for military service. If my opponent is so concerned with the safety of our young ones, I ask him, why is it acceptable for teenagers to serve in the military? - II. My opponent's second contention is that teens feel a sense of rebellion when they secretively use alcohol, and that they would not feel the same thrill if it were legal for them to use alcohol. This argument is logically unreasonable. When an activity such as drinking is condoned and accepted by society, teenagers will certainly partake in that activity more frequently and to a greater extent. In fact, one way that many teens gain access to alcohol is through older friends. Now, that means an 18 year old getting a 22 year old friend to by him or her alcohol; but, if 18 year olds or even 16 year olds were suddenly allowed to buy alcohol, this would mean that 14 and 13 year olds would increasingly have access to such dangerous substances, which would only exacerbate the issues I presented in my contention. - III. My opponent's third contention is that responsible parents will teach responsible behavior to their children, but this rests on the assumption that responsibility comes naturally with age. Although this may be partially true, responsibility is largely taught by society's norms. After several generations of children who grow up drinking alcohol, experiencing substance abuse problems, and early pregnancies, the values we cherish today will likely be eroded to the point that parents would encourage risky behavior in their children. - IV. Finally, my opponent states that the cost to our legal system is a reason why we should change the drinking age. He is essentially arguing that we should make shoplifting legal so that we do not have to prosecute the shoplifters. -CONCLUSION- Vote CON. [1] . http://www.washingtonpost.com... [2] . http://www.nlm.nih.gov... ---> Methodology of the Norberg study: \"Norberg \u2026 analyzed surveys of nearly 34,000 people born in the United States between 1948 and 1970, examining their records to determine if rates of alcoholism and drug abuse differed depending on their states' liquor-buying laws at the time the participants were teens or young adults. [This was possible because] In the early 1970s, 26 states lowered the drinking age to 18 after the federal voting age was lowered to 18, Norberg said. After passage in 1984 of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, the federal government pressured states to increase the drinking age or forfeit highway funds. \" [3] . http://www.uga.edu...", "qid": 48, "docid": "d20d622f-2019-04-18T19:15:59Z-00003-000", "score": 7.411200046539307}, {"content": "Title: Should the Drinking Age be lowered to 18 Content: Since you did not post any rules for this debate I will jump right in. To begin with the statement: \"legally considered to be adults and are considered mature enough to vote, smoke, be prosecuted as an adult and even become eligible for enlistment in the military. If an 18 year old is mature enough to make choices that are potentially life threatening, as well as responsible enough to vote and even in some cases to hold an elected office, then why shouldn't adults be allowed to purchase and consume alcohol.\" 1. But when you turn 18 you don't get everything \"unlocked\". \"Many rights in the United States are conferred on citizens at age 21 or older. A person cannot legally purchase a handgun, gamble in a casino (in most states), or adopt a child until age 21, rent a car (for most companies) at age 25, or run for President until age 35. Drinking should be similarly restricted due to the responsibility required to self and others.(1)\" Many of the list given when turn 18 are about how they are a danger and risk to yourself but lowering the drinking age is not a risk just to yourself, it is a risk to anyone on the road when you drink and drive. Now yes it is possible that SOME will not drink and drive,but it is impossible that all will not which brings me to my next point. 2. \"100 of the 102 analyses (98%) in a 2002 meta-study of the legal drinking age and traffic accidents found higher legal drinking ages associated with lower rates of traffic accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimated that MLDA 21 decreased the number of fatal traffic accidents for 18- to 20-year-olds by 13% and saved approximately 27,052 lives from 1975-2008.(1)\" \"Alcohol consumption can interfere with development of the young adult brain's frontal lobes, essential for functions such as emotional regulation, planning, and organization. When alcohol consumption interferes with this early adult brain development, the potential for chronic problems such as greater vulnerability to addiction, dangerous risk-taking behavior, reduced decision-making ability, memory loss, depression, violence, and suicide is greater.(1)\" \"\" Harmful use of alcohol results in the death of 2.5 million people annually, causes illness and injury to millions more, and increasingly affects younger generations and drinkers in developing countries. \" Nearly 4% of all deaths are related to alcohol. Most alcohol-related deaths are caused by alcohol result from injuries, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and liver cirrhosis. \" 6.2% of male deaths are related to alcohol, compared to 1.1% of female deaths. \" 320 000 young people aged 15-29 years die annually, from alcohol-related causes, resulting in 9% of all deaths in that age group.(2)\" Now that is just mind boggling \"320,000 young people aged 15-29 years die annually\" Imagine that number if drinking could be not only easier but legal for 18 year olds still possibly in high school to buy it and possibly distribute. Now this is just a intro into how damaging and bad lowering the age limit could be not only for the person themselves, but also their families, the victims family, and anyone on the road you could possibly injure or kill. In the following rounds I will continue to build my case for how damaging lowering the drinking age can be. Thank you very much for hosting this debate and I look forward to debating this.

ArgumentsMy opponent has NOT ONCE, attacked by arguments regarding the mental abilities of teenagers being able to vote. Again at 16, you cannot be on a jury, you cannot be drafted and serve in the military, you have not completed highschool, you have not completed basic civics, law, economics, and government courses, etc. My opponent has NO RESPONSE to this. I'm assuming he read my arguments, and if he did, he would have read where I pointed out that 16 year olds are still in highschool, still taking government and law classes. It is not important to my opponent that 16 year olds are too busy with school, getting an education, having a childhood social life, haven't completed basic law, government, and economics courses to know how the law, economy and government works. As long as they vote liberal. That is why my opponent entire \"rebuttal\" consisted of how great Obama was and how bad past presidents have messed up the \"money system\" or economy.

My opponent wants surefire liberal voters, not informed liberals/conservatives/libertarians who know how the economy and law work.

This Democratic Republic was established \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people. \u201d(1)At the time this government was established, it was a radical change from the governments that preceded it. We the people of the U. S. are to have a voice. We are to be able to elect our own representatives. Our Congress and our president are subject to our approval given via voting. Contrary to the tyrannical governments of history, the United States, \u201cwe the people,\u201d are intended to have the sovereignty and power to govern ourselves. As indicated, one fundamental way that we exercise our sovereignty is through voting. In the history of the United States, the sovereignty of the people has been reinforced as the vote has been expanded to groups that initially could not vote. For example, consider the 15th, 19th, and 26th Amendments. It is time that the liberty and sovereignty embodied by capacity to vote for President be extended to 17 year olds. For what reason could be given to restrict the liberty of 17 year olds. John Locke argued that The freedom then of man, and liberty of acting according to his own will, is grounded on his having reason, which is able to instruct him in that law he is to govern himself by, and make him know how far he is left to the freedom of his own will. To turn him loose to an unrestrained liberty, before he has reason to guide him, is not the allowing him the privilege of his nature to be free\"(1) The question of this debate is therefore, do 17 year olds possess the capability of reason. I submit that clearly, 17 year olds are as capable as those 18 years old. The difference between the two ages is negligible at best. The law of the land in most respects acknowledges this. Consider 17 year olds pay taxes (2), drive vehicles, be tried as adults for crimes, and can even die for their country serving in the military. (3) It seems arbitrary to submit 17 year olds to all the responsibility of 18 year olds without the power or sovereignty to vote. Until 17 year olds are granted the right to vote, they are victims of tyranny. Paying taxes without representation, being tried as an adult, and being able to enlist in the military, but being unrepresented in the government to which they are subjected to is tyrannical. My opponent must provide reasoning that demonstrates why 18 year olds differ enough from 17 year olds in such a way as to justify denying them the vote. As I have shown, the difference in age between the two is negligible and thus those who have reached the age of 17 ought to be able to vote for the president that will represent them the next four years.

Content: Contention 1: The Social AspectLet's face it, kids break the law. High school children these days love to party and they love to drink. The problem is actually buying the alcohol though. The current drinking age of 21 prevents youth from obtaining alcohol to consume at parties. If it were lowered to 18 then the seniors would buy several cases, bring it to parties, and let all of the 14-17 year olds drink some. Rather than claiming an independent impact to this contention, I would rather it function as an observation for the judges to keep in mind while reading over the cognitive arguments I will present when answering my opponent's arguments.A2: Suffrage/Marriage/Armed ForcesMy opponent is correct in stating that the age of 18 is when you are granted the ability to vote, get married and join the armed forces. However, he fails to realize that this is due to societal norms and nothing else. Furthermore, being 18 and being 21 also does not provide an objective difference in your ability to competently vote, choose a mate, or serve our country in the military. There is no scientific reason as to why a line should be drawn there.The magic number 18 does not, however, grant you full cognitive development. This arbitrary number was picked as the standard for adulthood long ago before psychological studies proved that the brain has yet to fully develop at this age.\"Specifically, the American Medical Association reports that '\u2026frontal lobe development and the refinement of pathways and connections continue until age 16, and a high rate of energy is used as the brain matures until age 20.' 'The hippocampus handles many types of memory and learning and suffers from the worst alcohol-related brain damage in teens. Those who had been drinking more and for longer had significantly smaller hippocampi (10 percent)'\" [1].As you can see, while 3 years of age may not affect your ability to fight in the military, it does influence your cognitive development and vulnerability to long-term damage suffered from alcohol. If we allow the brain to fully develop before people start drinking alcohol, we reduce the risk of permament damage.A2: Reduced Car Crashes1. Causation/CorrelationMy opponent's study is a representation of correlation, not causation. Citizens of these other countries have different lifestyles than American children. They have a greater respect for authority and listen when learning to drive. They are not spoiled so they do not believe that they are 'above' society and therefore obey driving laws. Lowering the drinking age doesn't cause a society to be more mature and reasonable. My opponnt also casts a shadow of doubt over the possibility of the study proving causation by mentioning stricter laws on blood alcohol levels. He directly attributes wiser decision-making to this. It's possible to impose stricter laws while retaining the age limit of 21.2. Turn: Lowering the legal drinking age increases car accidents. \"IIHS's first study in 1974 looked at two states and one Canadian province that lowered the drinking age, carefully comparing their experience to that of adjacent states that did not change. That study showed that the number of 15-20 year-olds involved in fatal crashes increased in the jurisdictions that lowered the drinking age. Subsequently, in the late 1970s, states began to increase drinking ages again. Again, it was possible to compare states that made this change to states that didn't. Again, we saw a change related to the drinking age \u2014 this time, fatal crash rates declined as teen drinking and teen drinking and driving declined\" [2]. Closing Note\"Each year, approximately 5,000 young people under the age of 21 die as a result of underage drinking; this includes about 1,900 deaths from motor vehicle crashes, 1,600 as a result of homicides, 300 from suicide, as well as hundreds from other injuries such as falls, burns, and drownings\" [3].Do we really want to lower the drinking age to 18 and increase the access youth has to alcohol? imscrappy, are you okay with letting these kids die because of their poor decisions when we could have prevented them from making bad choices in the first place?1. http://www.chooseresponsibility.org...2. http://www.iihs.org...3. http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov...", "qid": 48, "docid": "d7eab276-2019-04-18T18:43:27Z-00000-000", "score": 7.344200134277344}, {"content": "Title: Lowering the voting age to 16 Content: I am not saying that every single right granted at eighteen should be lowered to sixteen, but just voting.

But it is not required as I stated before it is a privelege and that privelege should be allowed for 18 year olds. \"This is true, but has policing stopped drunk driving amongst people ages 21 and over? It HAS lowered the rate, but NO it HAS NOT entirely eradicated the issue. Drunk driving amongst people ages 18 to 20 is not anywhere near as big of an issue as it is amongst their elders for reasons the even my opponent as stated before, and I reasons I will state again for clarification\" No issue can truly be eradicated you will have people abuse everything. Take the welfare system for example. Thousands of people who do not need welfare cheat and lie so they can receive it. I am not saying abuse is right but you can not truly eradicate an issue that is like trying to eradicate your thought process or your feelings. \"Now when my opponent says that drinking was moved \"to cars\" I'm assuming he means that people park their cars in parking lots and have a few beers with their friends because he was talking about underage drinking NOT being policed. If they were drinking and driving, it WOULD be policed. So, with what my opponent stated, isn't the fact that underage drinkers choose to remain immobile whilst drinking a good thing? It keeps them off the roadways, so they don't drag innocent lives down with them. Lowering the drinking age would put them (though still illegal) on the streets.\" And as you stated if they were on the roadways it WOULD be policed. So, your point seems kind of self refuting. Also, I would like to ask how can irrefutable evidence (facts) be mindless? Just throwing that out there. \"I acknowledge that the drinking age in other countries is lower and that they do drink in moderation, but it has been so since their laws were enacted and because of that they are expected to respect that privilege. If the United States dropped the drinking age to 18, we have not, even at age 21 and up, learned to respect our privileges to consume alcohol. Why do people between the ages of 18 and 20 deserve to drink if not even their elders can do so appropriately?\" MY opponent says that other countries do drink in moderation with a lower drinking age. Yet, he uses no evidence to back up how the United States could not do that by lowering the drinking age. I happen to think it would and my evidence are countries like the United Kingdom or Germany. I will brink up the same point I have been bringing up if you are old enough to fight in a war draft or not. Than you should be allowed to drink. If you can vote for president and impact your country in a political way. You should be able to drink If you can decide the decision in a rape or murder case (jury duty) you should be allowed to drink. So, it seems very very unjust that the government can trust you in selecting its officials, risking your life for it and decided someone's fate for a crime they have or have not committed, to not let you drink. Surely, the drinking age must be lowered to 18 for the above arguments. I thank my opponent for the debate.

I argue that the line should be drawn at 18 because that\"s when kids go to college, and a drinking age of 18 grants colleges more discretion to ensure that students are drinking in supervised and safe environments. In contrast, my opponent chooses the completely arbitrary age of 21. My opponent talks about drugs, but that\"s irrelevant to the debate. This isn\"t a debate about drug legalization. There\"s no \"responsible\" way to use heroin and no \"irresponsible\" way to use marijuana, so the analogy doesn\"t even apply. Learning moderation is unique to the alcohol context. My opponent loses by essentially conceding my Seaman evidence, which proves that college students *can* learn responsible drinking behavior in the right environment if the drinking age is lowered. McGill is in Canada, where the drinking age is 18; my opponent seems confused and thinks it\"s in the US. Furthermore, he says people can drink with parents at 18, but that\"s not a true legal drinking age of 21. He\"s basically conceding that people *do* need to learn responsible drinking behavior from older people, but disagrees that peers, RA\"s, and professors are a good group to learn from. The fact is that college students don\"t respect their parents\" views on alcohol: they think their parents are lame. They are only going to learn responsible behavior from peers and people they respect, in a \"normal\" drinking environment (not in their homes, under parental supervision). My opponent also concedes my Stanford example, but then says that parents can teach children. However, the Stanford structure wouldn\"t work under that framework. Parents do not live with their children in their dormitories, which is where they are going to consume alcohol. Only a structure that legalizes Stanford\"s only semi-legal regime would help to impart more responsible drinking behavior upon college students. I don\"t advocate merely lowering the drinking age, but also putting in place systems like those at Stanford and McGill that impart responsible drinking behavior. One hundred thirty college presidents agree with me because they want to adopt similar systems. Lastly, my opponent cold concedes the rape argument. He merely says that rape is caused by other factors, but I provided a *link* between a higher drinking age and rape: women have to pre-drink (which causes them to black out) and can only \"party\" at fraternities, which are high-risk for rape. My opponent provides no other plausible explanation for why rapes on college campuses in Canada are nearly two-thirds lower. Americans and Canadians are not so different that it can be explained by culture. Reducing rapes by two-thirds is the biggest impact in this debate and is why you should vote Pro. == Rebuttal == R1) Health My opponent concedes that three-fourths of underage students drink now. He also concedes that almost one-fifth of all alcohol drinks consumed in the US is by underage people. The question is *not* whether they will drink, but *how* they will drink. Right now, 90% of them binge drink. My intervention can only hope to ameliorate this. My opponent also concedes that only *heavy* drinking causes negative health effects. Light to moderate alcohol consumption actually has positive health effects, such as better memory in later life. [1] So the question is not whether young people will drink, but whether they will do it in a way that hurts their health, or doesn\"t. Only interventions that teach more responsible drinking can solve this problem, so this point goes to Pro. R2) Violence in bars By conceding my meta-study that lowering the drinking age does not increase violence or criminality among youth, my opponent loses this point. I also turn this point with my study showing that pre-gaming culture leads to more violence, so any intervention that reduces pre-gaming culture reduces violence. R3) Responsibility The US no longer *needs* 18-year-old soldiers. This isn\"t WWII anymore. But at age 18, we still allow people to die for their country, get married, and take on crushing debt that could take a lifetime to pay off. [2] If we trust 18-year-olds enough as adults to do *these* things, then we should also trust them to drink alcohol. We shouldn\"t infantilize them and pretend they are adults in some respects, but not in others. The age of 21 is arbitrary. There is no policy reason to choose this age over any other. On fairness grounds, you should vote Pro on this point alone. If you are old enough to die for your country, you are old enough to drink a beer. Arguments in favor of reducing teenage pregnancy would not justify raising the age of consent to 21. The current drinking age implicates basic principles of autonomy. R4) Traffic fatalities My opponent drops my studies proving that drunk driving fatalities were *already* falling prior to the adoption of the drinking age and that *other countries* saw similar drops, despite not changing their drinking age laws. So he can\"t hope to win this point. His evidence from Japan and Morocco is inconclusive. The Morocco statistic was for *all* vehicle fatalities, not just drunk driving fatalities. The Japan statistic was that only 10% of traffic fatalities in Japan were due to drunk driving. But that could simply mean that for some reason, Japan has a lot more *non*-alcohol-related road fatalities (compared to other countries). The number of drunk driving fatalities per thousand residents is a better statistic for cross-country comparison, but Pro doesn\"t provide this number. As further proof, 32% of all traffic fatalities in the US are caused by drunk driving. [2] Thus, even though our drinking age is one year *higher* than in Japan, we have a much larger percentage of drunk driving fatalities (compared to total vehicle fatalities) than Japan does. Either the *percentage* of fatalities due to drunk driving is a meaningless number, or the US-Japan comparison proves that a *lower* drinking age in Japan caused fewer alcohol-related fatalities. Furthermore, my opponent never answers my objection that there is no evidence that there are more drunk driving fatalities (per thousand residents) in Canada and Europe, which have much lower drinking ages. R5) Healthier This argument is no different than \"medically dangerous.\" Look to R1 for my response. R6) Trickle down There is reason to believe that alcohol won\"t trickle down to lower-age high school students: they lack the \"connections\" to older students to convince them to buy them alcohol. Con dismisses my argument as merely anecdotal, but it\"s not only based on my personal experience, but observing everyone at my high school: freshmen were not friends with seniors. Con doesn\"t even attempt to claim that his own high school experience is any different, so mine is the only proof offered in this debate. Furthermore, he *drops* my argument that high school students (unlike college students) have nowhere to drink. There\"s a reason that most high school drinking takes place at prom: it\"s the only night where kids are away from their parents. And while fake ID\"s are illegal, so is furnishing alcohol to a minor. If my opponent is suggesting that illegality is an effective deterrent, then 18-year-olds will be deterred from furnishing alcohol to minors (which is a rather serious offense, more serious currently than giving alcohol to someone *over* 18). R7) Drugs Con claims that his study didn\"t include marijuana, but it did. The comparison to Japan is rather ridiculous. Marijuana is just not a popular drug there, considering only 1.2% have tried it *ever* in their lives. In the US, 32.8% of high school seniors have tried marijuana. [3] These cross-country comparisons simply don\"t work. Con concedes my \"respect for the law\" argument, which is a turn: people try drugs at young ages because alcohol is illegal, and they try that and wonder what other illegal things might not be as bad as society claims. Lowering the drinking age would therefore decrease drug use. He also drops that his correlation is merely due to a risk-taking personality, that marijuana constitutes most of the drug use in the study and marijuana is less bad than alcohol, and that there is no evidence that drug use is more rampant among youth in Canada or Europe where the drinking age is lower. Thus, none of Con\"s points survive scrutiny, whereas I prove that lowering the drinking age will promote more responsible drinking behavior and *significantly* reduce rape. This outweighs any of Pro\"s speculative impacts, which do not bear up when looking to Canada or Europe. Vote Pro. [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com...

Sure they will, but you need stats to prove that lowering the drinking age has no effect, whereas I have stats showing a higher age lowers the amount of users.Seniors who lived in states with a drinking age of 21 drank less then ones with lower drinking ages.

They re more likely to have problems with work, school, or problems with the police.

Content: I'm going to try and keep these short since there's not a whole essay to write. On July 17, 1984, Unitd States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age into effect, increasing the drinking age from 18 years of age to 21 years of age. This limited the purchase, sales, and consumption to anyone underneath this age. Previously, the states had set their own laws as to the drinking age which varied from eighteen years old to twenty-one at the time. The vast majority had it set at eighteen years. The United States is one of ONLY FOUR developed countries in the entire world to have this age set to over 18. It currently has the highest drinking age in the world. The other countries are South Korea being 19, parts of Canada being 19, Japan being 20, and Iceland being 19 years. The majority of the world has it set at eighteen years of age with a few exceptions at sixteen. At the age of 18 years of age, one becomes a legal adult. This person is able to vote in all national elections including Presidential, Congressional, and Gubernational. They are able to legally vote for the person that runs our country. This is far more important than consuming alcohol. They are also able to enlist in the military, righteously defend their country, be drafted, and participate in war. They could possibly be killed in battle as well. An eighteen year old person is also able to smoke and buy tobacco legally. They are able to inhale nicotine, smoke, and chemicals into their body through cigarettes or cigars. This causes far more damage than alcohol. Not to mention that they are also able to play the LOTTERY and win millions of dollars for themselves. An eighteen year old can also legally have sex without risk of statutory rape being pressed against them, they can visit a sex store, and legally watch or produce pornography. An eighteen year old is able to move out without the support of their parents, apply for welfare and food stamps, build up credit, and take out loans for cars, houses, school, or anything of the sort. So let's sum this up. An eighteen year old is an adult, can be a part of the military, die for their country, vote for the leader of their country, smoke highly addictive cigarettes and cigars, known to cause cancer, move out of their parent's hospitatility, legally buy a car or house and take out loans, have sex and watch porn with no problem, but cannot drink alcohol. While alcohol can be psychologically addictive, it is nowhere as dangerous as tobacco smoke. Alcohol is a stimulant and depressant and should be drinken responsibly. An eighteen year old can doing anything else responsibly, so why not drink? This would also lower the amount of worry and preoccupation of police officers on college campuses with students trying to smuggle it into the campus. This is why the alcohol purchase and consumption age should nationally be lowered to age 18 after thirty years of having it at twenty-one years of age.", "qid": 48, "docid": "144e57bb-2019-04-18T16:53:38Z-00001-000", "score": 7.30709981918335}, {"content": "Title: The legal drinking age in the U.S.A. ought to be lowered to 18. Content: Refutations to my opponent's caseReduced Alcohol Related Driving FatalitiesI would like to first point to the fact that my opponent's source link does not actually take us to a specific article, just to mentalfloss.com, making it so we have to manually search for the information.Now that that's been said, it is important to address how misleading the statistics my opponent has cited are. Yes, traffic reports show a decrease in alcohol fatalities among teen drivers since 1982. However, what wasn't mentioned is that that trend started in the early 1970's, years before the legislative changes to make the legal drinking age 21, suggesting no causal relationship between increasing the drinking age and decreasing alcohol fatalities. Additionally, there are other factors that played into this other than the drinking age, like lower blood-alcohol content limits, mandatory seatbelts, increased public awareness of the problems with drunk driving, airbags, so one cannot buy into my opponent's claims that alcohol fatalities among drivers has dropped as a result of the 21 year old drinking age (1).Additionally, it is important to note what is being spoken of when speaking about alcohol fatalities and alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Those refer to any fatalities where someone who has been drinking (no matter how little they have drunk) is involved. If a pedestrian with a blood alcohol content as low as .01 is walking across the street and gets hit by a car with a sober driver, that counts as an alcohol related fatality. So based on the numbers given, we can't even determine that teen drunk driving ending in fatalities has decreased (2).Also, in other countries where the drinking age was 18, like Canada, the alcohol-related traffic fatalities have gone down at an even faster rate than it did over the same time period that my opponent cited, once again making it clear that there is no likely causal relationship between a 21 year old drinking age and lowering alcohol-related traffic fatalities (3).Medically IrresponsibleHere is where it is important to once again draw the distinction between alcohol use and alcohol abuse. The claims that alcohol impairs brain development through a person's twenties comes from a few sources- one is that of giving rats extremely high levels of alcohol, and the second is from studying alcohol and/or drug dependent individuals. It's not surprising that alcoholics do worse at mental tasks than those who don't abuse alcohol. To address the lab rats, these studies gave huge amounts of alcohol to the lab rats. This would be roughly equivalent to forcing a teen to binge drink daily for weeks or months, and then seeing what would happen. At lower levels of consumption, however, adolescent rats tended to be \"less susceptible to motor impairment and also less easily sedated than are older rats.\" This would suggest that for rat's brains and alcohol, these studies don't produce reliable conclusions. Add to this that rat's function fundamentally differently than humans (for example, many disease cures that work on rats don't work on humans), and you get that this simply doesn't work as a reliable source.To address the studies that deal with humans, it is not exactly surprising that large amounts of alcohol can impair brain development. That being said, those studies never deal with moderate or light drinking, so we do not know at this point if that impairs brain development. This being said, it would seem logically sound to assume that, in the very least, moderate or light drinking harms brain development less than alcohol abuse. I have already shown in my previous round how lowering the drinking age would lower alcohol abuse. This means that, by voting for my side, by voting to lower the drinking age to 18, it is actually reducing the problems cited by con with regards to brain development. I am actually creating solvency by lowering the drinking age to 18, while my opponent is defending a culture where underage drinking is done behind closed doors and binge drinking is rampant. It is clear that I have the better impacts.If anything, it would be medically irresponsible to keep the drinking age at 21, as that results in higher alcohol abuse, which causes more harms than lowering the drinking age to 18 would.(4)Age of InitiationThis directly clashes with my third contention, which was about maturity. My opponent neglects to mention that we can join the military and vote at 18, which both obviously require more responsibility to self and others than drinking does. This means that the law is currently representing an inconsistent and unfair standard by having the drinking age at 21. It would be more logical to simply support the fact that people have ownership over themselves and say that, once they are an adult, once they are 18, they should be able to choose what goes into their own bodies. If the voters would like, they can re-read my first and third contention, as they both refute my opponent's age of initiation point quite nicely.ConclusionI have shown how lowering the drinking age would reduce binge drinking, how a person has sovereignty over themselves, and how the law currently shows inconsistency and unfairness with respect to maturity and legality. All of those contentions, on their own, could support my burden of proof, so if any of them remain standing at the end of the debate, then I have won. As my opponent has neglected to respond, they are still standing as of now. I have shown how all of my opponents points are false, baseless, work for my side, or are illogical/inconsistent, so none of his contentions currently stand.Thank you for reading thus far, and I hope that my opponent decides to respond in this coming round.Sources:1. http://www.chooseresponsibility.org...2. http://www2.potsdam.edu...3. http://dailycaller.com...4. http://www2.potsdam.edu...", "qid": 48, "docid": "d0d79e99-2019-04-18T16:09:24Z-00001-000", "score": 7.305200099945068}, {"content": "Title: Should the drinking age be lower than 21 Content: The drinking age should be lower than 21, at age 18 young people are considered to be adults, they are able to vote, buy Cigarettes and even go into clubs.

Adults should have the right to make there own decisions regarding alcohol. If their country does not trust them with this how can adulthood be taken seriously? Today, turning 18 entails receiving the rights and responsibilities of adulthood to vote, smoke cigarettes, serve on juries, get married, sign contracts, be prosecuted as adults, and join the military ; some of these things are dangerous, but as people have become adults, they have the right to choose whether or not they want to do these dangerous things. Why should they not choose to drink or not?2. If drinking from 18 - 20 becomes legal, than there will be less alcohol related problems. This is because as they will be drinking in regulated environments, it will not be as dangerous as underage drinking today. As these people will be allowed to drink in restaurants, bars, etc., they will be in a place that can make sure there is no reckless behavior with alcohol.3.

In my opinion if somebody wants to abuse alcohol their whole life then that is their decision and they should be held responsible for their own mistakes. Here in the UK we tend to follow this theory and the number of drink driving fatalities is much less than that of America due to the government's efficient regulating. We impose a high tax rate for beer and some establishments don't serve customers under the age of 21, although consumption still remains legal for those over the age of 18.

My opponent is in favor of not lowering the drinking age to 18.Of the many reasons why the drinking age should be lowered, I will the select the top three reasons that represent why I am in favor of lowering the drinking age.1. Legal Adulthood is 18 in US. 2. When persons under 21 drinks, they tend to drink more for the thrill.3. With the current law in place, people still drink alcohol in private locations.1. When a person reaches the age of 18 years old in the United States, they are a legal adult. They have the right to vote in an election and they have the right to enlist in the army. To put it in limelight, an adult can choose who their leader is and can choose to take a bullet for the country. With these responsibilities, it is only right that they should be allowed to bear the responsibility of alcohol. The definition of a legal adult: a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient and responsible. A legal adult is responsible as the previous definition states. So with that responsibility, legal adults should be allowed to purchase and drink alcohol due to the fact that they are reasons to do so by definition. I ask, why can a legal adult have their right to consume stripped from them?2. With the current age restriction in place, drinking alcohol is a special privilege reserved for those older than 21. When 18-20 year olds get their hands on it, they tend to go crazy with it. This only happens because they are excited and thrilled that they have got their hands on this special thing and do not know when the next time will come where they can drink this special thing. The effect of this is drunk drivers and alcohol related deaths. If the age restriction was lowered, 18-20 year olds wouldn't view alcohol as a special drink, it would just be regarded as any other normal beverage. If 18-20 years could buy alcohol, then they wouldn't binge drink when they get their hands on alcohol because they know when they want more they can just go to the store and get some.3. Even now with the current age restriction in place, 18-20 year olds still drink in private locations, away from the public eye. This adds to the danger of unsafe drinking. If 18 year old were allowed to drink, they would drink more often in bars and other public places. This would in turn provide a safer drinking environment for them, as they would be under the supervision of employees, bartenders and police.Additionally, the current law does not good. The law in unenforceable with 18-20 year olds still able to drink behind closed doors. The current law is just a burden to those who have reached adulthood.http://healthresearchfunding.org...http://www.cognac.com...http://drinkingage.procon.org...http://en.wikipedia.org...", "qid": 48, "docid": "ed9141f0-2019-04-18T15:53:35Z-00003-000", "score": 7.232800006866455}, {"content": "Title: The drinking age in the United States should be 18 Content: I'm going to try and keep these short since there's not a whole essay to write. On July 17, 1984, Unitd States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age into effect, increasing the drinking age from 18 years of age to 21 years of age. This limited the purchase, sales, and consumption to anyone underneath this age. Previously, the states had set their own laws as to the drinking age which varied from eighteen years old to twenty-one at the time. The vast majority had it set at eighteen years. The United States is one of ONLY FOUR developed countries in the entire world to have this age set to over 18. It currently has the highest drinking age in the world. The other countries are South Korea being 19, parts of Canada being 19, Japan being 20, and Iceland being 19 years. The majority of the world has it set at eighteen years of age with a few exceptions at sixteen. At the age of 18 years of age, one becomes a legal adult. This person is able to vote in all national elections including Presidential, Congressional, and Gubernational. They are able to legally vote for the person that runs our country. This is far more important than consuming alcohol. They are also able to enlist in the military, righteously defend their country, be drafted, and participate in war. They could possibly be killed in battle as well. An eighteen year old person is also able to smoke and buy tobacco legally. They are able to inhale nicotine, smoke, and chemicals into their body through cigarettes or cigars. This causes far more damage than alcohol. Not to mention that they are also able to play the LOTTERY and win millions of dollars for themselves. An eighteen year old can also legally have sex without risk of statutory rape being pressed against them, they can visit a sex store, and legally watch or produce pornography. An eighteen year old is able to move out without the support of their parents, apply for welfare and food stamps, build up credit, and take out loans for cars, houses, school, or anything of the sort. So let's sum this up. An eighteen year old is an adult, can be a part of the military, die for their country, vote for the leader of their country, smoke highly addictive cigarettes and cigars, known to cause cancer, move out of their parent's hospitatility, legally buy a car or house and take out loans, have sex and watch porn with no problem, but cannot drink alcohol. While alcohol can be psychologically addictive, it is nowhere as dangerous as tobacco smoke. Alcohol is a stimulant and depressant and should be drinken responsibly. An eighteen year old can doing anything else responsibly, so why not drink? This would also lower the amount of worry and preoccupation of police officers on college campuses with students trying to smuggle it into the campus. This is why the alcohol purchase and consumption age should nationally be lowered to age 18 after thirty years of having it at twenty-one years of age.

States should fight to lower the drinking age to create justice. Since we live in a society that attempts to be as just as possible, the goal of achieving justice must be held high if not as the highest goal. The victory creates justice in the short term and the long term. Short-term: The lowering achieves justice by righting a wrong. The current law provides no warrant for the age limit being a fair due because there is none. With a lower age limit, it would be much easier to have a just reason to have the restriction. Thus, the lowering of the age limit would remove injustice and thus cause justice. Long-term: 1.States win the fight and the drinking age is lowered. 2.As common sense would dictate, more drunken related accidents and deaths would happen as the amount of drinkers would rise because more people would be able drink legally. However, this is not because of the age of those legal. This is simply because there are bozos in every age group, from 19 to 99, that do foolish acts. Thus, this increase cannot be used to justify keeping the age limit where it is. 3.More people would drink to relieve themselves of the depression of losing their loved ones causing more drunken accidents and growing chaos. 4.Eventually, the spiraling ball of chaos and deaths would make the leader of the United States realize that nihilism is the most logical philosophy to adopt. 5.In order to save more lives, the president realizes that he must kill as many people as possible to prevent more lives being born that would be killed. Hence, as commander-in-chief, he orders all nuclear weapons, intercontinental-ballistics missiles, etc., etc., to be fired. 6.Invriably, at least some of these weapons will fall in other countries. They will interpret this as threat to them selves and will volley weapons back, thus starting a nuclear war. 7.All humans die either from the nuclear war directly or from the resulting radiation.

Basically, all I asking is that the voters (judges or otherwise) not base their decision on arguments created by them that are not present in the debate, 2. Although I also don't think this will be a problem with the judges, I will mention it to be safe. What I will mention is that any new arguments by Con in the third round are abusive as I will not have a chance to respond. Hence, they should not be considered.

At this point, we can understand that neither of our \"personal experiances\" will hold any weight in this debate, so this point completely drops for both sides. as for the drunk driving, my opponent also concedes that he cannot prove it, and ends with simply stating \"he feels there would be less drunk drivers on the roads, because all the minors would be at the bars. \" Well that's nice and all, but the bars have to close some-time, so this proves my point entirely.

Following the the Pro logic, this will eventually lead to a complete collapse of all our society's morality. 3b. No, of course that's not what I'm saying. some may just die altogether! this is a ridiculous defense to a ridiculous attack. Of course there will be more drunk driver if there are more people drinking. Con 1a. Despite what you consider minors, the law recognizes a person of 18 years of age to be an adult. There is no hypocrisy here, as I said before; Ciggarettes do not impare cognative ability. while I agree (as I already have) ciggarettes are very much so bad for you, they won't cause people to drive drunk, or spend their entire pay check on ciggarettes instead of food, and necessities. (also again, I was never give a burden to have to prove cigarettes as good) 1b. I ask you to please re-read what My opponent said here. go ahead I'l wait. .. you see he only proves my point. there can be no good in lowering the drinking age. The ONLY benefit would be for the Alcohol industries as they would get more money out of it. Society as whole would detriment and suffer. 2a.

Now here, my opponent claims he's already made the points that the refutation here should be obvious, he claims that having the minors in bars would be better than the street (which is completely ridiculous). and that it could potentially lower crimes (this means nothing as anything could potentially lower or heighten anything). H ealso claims finally he claims that this would substantially lower the level of Binge drinking among college students. two points here, we have already conceded that college binge drinking is not much of a problem in the first place, and secondly no; as it will just heighten binge drinking in people ages 18-20, In conclusion, the vote must go to me. I have proven through both my opponent's mpoints and my own- that not good can possibly come from loweing the drinking age.

Non-Americans are also affected by politics. Regardless of whether they are American or not is unimportant, the fact is that if you're in a country, the country's policies affect you. Also, women and black people being excluded from voting is not the same as excluding teenagers.

Content: I am hoping for a good healthy debate. First, since my opponent did not, I would like to look at a definition to run today's round by. Mature: fully developed in body or mind, as a person Now lets look at several of my opponents points first. My opponent brings up the idea of \"taxation without representation\" and brings up the IRS (no source? ) that says teenagers pay 9.7 billion dollars in sales taxes alone. Of course they do! Teenagers love buying things. Whether it be food, drinks, clothes, video games, movies, or any other of the many things teenagers buy they are going to have to face a sales tax. Regardless of your age you face sales tax. If a ten year old wants to buy something he is subjected to sales tax. Does this make him ready to vote? Of course not. She then goes on to say that 16 year olds can get a job. Just because you can work at a McDonald's doesn't qualify you to vote. Sure getting a job at 16 is good for several reasons. They mature even more in a work setting and learn how to adapt to a work setting. Does this automatically make them fully aware of politics and prepared to vote? Not by a long shot. This debate about lowering the voting age isn't only taking place in the United States. It is taking place all over the world. However, one things rings throughout most of the nations. People believe that 16 year olds just aren't ready enough to vote. I personally think that the age limit should remain the same. Whilst some young people mature earlier and have developed definitive opinions below this age, one thing I have learnt by my middle age is that our opinions and thoughts continue to develop throughout our life and that \"maturity\" is actually difficult to define. I think 18 is the right age, an age of independence for many, going to university, starting work etc and an age where people start to take responsibility for themselves and their future. Besides teenagers have enough to worry about. \" (BBC News. Source below) She then goes on to state that the only reason teens aren't informed is because they can not vote. We can see through logic that this isn't true. I know people who are much older then the voting age who are uninformed about what they are voting about. Just having the ability to vote doesn't make them more informed or even give them the desire to be more well informed. She also says that students are learning about politics in school. The key word here is \"learning. \" They have not learned everything they needed to know yet. They need to continue to learn about politics, history, and the way our government works before we can put a ballot in their hands and send them to the polls. They just simply aren't prepared yet. My opponent then goes on to make her weakest argument of her case. She says that \"16-ers are old enough to have a job, and have sex. .. \" Wait up here! Is my opponent trying to advocate that once someone has sex they have the right to vote? That is absolutely untrue. Just because a teenager may have sex doesn't qualify them to vote. This is such a silly argument to advocate for people to vote. If we are to follow this line of thinking than having sex should be a qualification to vote since it some how proves that someone is mature. It does not prove this what so ever. This whole argument that 16 year olds are well informed is also bogus. Teenagers are worried about homework, girlfriends, boyfriends, gossip, personal image, video games, clubs, Facebook, and a plethora of other things. Now we expect these kids that are too worried about not having a date to Prom to have the right to vote. They wont become magically well informed if they get the right to vote. Now I am not saying all teenagers are misinformed or uninformed. However, my opponent is advocating not just for the well informed teens, but also for those who are out partying under age because they want to fit in. She is also advocating for those teenagers who don't care about school and are failing all of their classes. She is advocating for the worst of teens as well as the best of teens. The worst teens either don't care to vote, or will vote with whoever they think is cool. So the election will no longer be about the issues, but who is the most \"hip\" or the most popular among their peers. Teens won't care about the president's view on the war on terror or about the welfare program. They will go along with what their peers do. We should know this because we either are or were teenagers. My opponent's goal is a nice idea. However, we simply can see that most 16 year olds aren't well informed enough or mature enough to vote. Give them two years to learn more and get that high school diploma. At least then we know that those kids knew enough to pass their government class and that they have learned what was required of them to graduate. Teenagers aren't in control of their life yet. They can't get a better job then at a retail store or at a fast food chain because they don't have their diploma yet. What is two years going to be to a 16 year old? Let the teenagers be teenagers and enjoy high school. Let them have one less thing to worry about. In closing I'd like to ask my opponent to please list her sources websites.

At 18 kids can fight in the army, drive a car, smoke a cigarette, own a gun, vote, serve on jury duty, sign a contract, and take out a loan. Often times, people claim that the the 19 year olds are not mature enough to decide whether to drink or not. We trust 19 year olds with much greater choices and responsibilities then whether to consume alcohol. If they are mature enough to engage in lethal force against enemies and possibly die or kill others or get a mental disorder, operate a heavy vehicle where a mistake could cost lives and ruin property, smoke a highly addictive drug that causes 1 in 5 premature deaths and is detrimental to every organ in the body [1], help determine laws and choose leaders,own a weapon designed to kill could enable a death( murder, suicide accident), decide whether a peer should go to jail/face execution, enter into a binding agreement, they are responsible enough to decide whether to drink or not.

Not many people follow the law. 82 % of college students under 21 drink [2]. Should we really have a law that 4 out of 5 people break? Most people who do not drink choose not to do so for health or religious reasons. Almost no one chooses not to drink for the sake of being a law abiding citizen. One could object saying that everyone speeds, but having a speed limit is a necessary law. The difference is that speeding is not strictly enforced. If an officer clocks someone is going 1, 5, or even 10 over the limit it is rare that they will get a ticket. In fact, most would agree that an officer would be in the wrong for this. Tickets should only be handed out if someone is driving recklessly or going way over the limit. Same with drinking. Drinking at 19 should be regarded as going 5 over the limit, not worthy of punishment.3. The law does not greatly effect drunk driving deathsThe reason the drinking age was raised from 18 to 21 in 1984 was to decrease drunk driving deaths. Many people claim that this law is effective because drunk driving deaths decreased after the law was passed. However, the drunk driving deaths have been decreasing at a relatively constant rate since 1982. In 1982 there were about 26 thousand deaths compared to about 13 thousand in 2009. Again, it has been decreasing each year at relatively constant rate. [3] As time goes on, and people become more aware of alcohol dangers, and life saving technology improves drunk driving deaths decrease, regardless of the drinking age. 4. Punish the crime, not the derivative of the crimeIf people have a problem with drunk driving, they should increase the penalty for drunk driving. They should not punish a \"derivative of the crime they are against\". For example, a reasonable way to deal with drunk driving would be to make jail mandatory for DUIs, not to make it illegal to drink. Responsible drinking is a victimless crime. Those adults who drink responsibly should not be deprived of liberty for the poor actions of a few. 4. Many societal benefits for reducing the drinking age Decreasing the drinking age will create more responsible drinkers and lead to a better society. Not allowing young adults to drink is somewhat of a self fulfilling prophecy. Society treats 19-21 year olds like they cannot handle responsibility, and 19-21 year olds act accordingly. In Canada ( a country with similar culture to USA), the drinking age is either 18 or 19. While more college students drink in Canada, there are less binge drinkers in Canada than in the USA [4]. If 19-20 year olds could drink, they could go out to pubs/clubs which would be more safe than frat houses, house parties. It would be more safe because there are adults around, and if someone does become too drunk, they would not be afraid to seek help or get help for a friend. For example, at University of Colorado an underage student died of alcohol poisoning after a fraternity initiation. The student passed out of the couch and did not wake up. No one got help for the student because the feared being punished for breaking underage drinking laws [5]. Every country in North/South America and Europe has a drinking age lower than the USA. The only countries that are as/more strict on underage drinking are Islamic fascist countries such as United Arab Emirates and Tajikistan[6]. There is a lot of social value in drinking. Having a drink with someone is a good way to make friends and network. Society should focus on teaching responsible drinking instead of trying to trying to eliminate 19-20 yo drinking. No one should have a problem with someone who is done high school, drinking. ConclusionI have shown that a 21 yo drinking age is logically inconsistent with other freedoms given to young adults, the law has been ineffective at stopping underage drinking, the law did not greatly affect drunk driving deaths, it is wrong to deprive responsible acting adults of their liberty to drink and their are many societal benefits of lowering the drinking age. The USA should lower the drinking age to 19. Vote Pro. [1]. http://en.wikipedia.org...

Why 16 and not, say, 18 .. or 21? In the negative case I cited scientific evidence that maturity in terms of brain development is not reached until at least 21. Until that age, individuals inherently are more subject to addiction and they lack the full ability to relate actions to consequences. I pointed out that Japanese society, where alcohol is more enshrined s a social activity than in the US, is well fixed on 20 as the legal age. Drinking, driving, and voting are serious responsibilities and both the science and the evidence points to having a legal age closer to 21, than to lowering the age to 16. So unless there is compelling factual evidence to the contrary, which has not been presented, the legal age for the specified rights should not be lowered.Pro did not contest any of the evidence or arguments presented in the negative case, so the negative case stands. The resolution includes voting rights, but Pro has not made an argument that 16 year-olds have sufficient experience to vote. C1: Do teens have adult responsibilities?Pro grants that 16-year-olds should no be granted full adult responsibilities. Pro says he does not \"foolishly pretend a 16 year old should be allowed to sign contracts, sue, and move out on their own.\" However, if it is \"foolish\" to allow 16 year-olds to sign contracts or move out, it is even more foolish to allow them to drink, drive, and vote. The damage to themselves and to society is greater. A nuisance lawsuit can be quashed, and a runaway can return home upon reflection, but alcohol abuse and vehicle accidents are not so easily undone. Young voters can damage society by promoting irresponsible self-interest -- youthful brains to not link up consequences.Pro argues that high school case have a great deal of stress. I agree with that premise. However, alcohol use is not the right way to attempt to reduce stress. It isn't the right way for older people either. It is worse for youth because of their inherent susceptibility to addiction. There are better ways to cope with stress than alcohol (or drugs). A philosophical attitude is the best, but if that cannot be managed, then video games or any hobby fulfilled with a passion. (Sex is better than alcohol, ... sometimes even the kind involving another person.)Pro argues \"if you can afford something (IE. Wine, a car) with your own hard earned money, it should be available to you.\" That's not true at any age, e.g., prescription drugs (antibiotics as well as dangerous ones), automatic weapons, high explosives, poisoned gas, exotic pets of various kinds, infectious agents, radioactive materials. Those are perhaps obvious, but local ordinances forbid all sorts of things from advertising signs to flags on flagpoles. Soon, you won't be allowed to buy an ordinary light bulb, no matter that you an afford one. Some prohibitions are reasonable and some are unreasonable, but the argument that if you can afford it you should be able to have it is invalid.Pro challenges, \"You mention that adolescence is prolonged more then ever. Do you think this is right?\" I think that adolescence should not be prolonged beyond 21, but up to 21 rights and privileges need to be considered case by case. Even for young children, society has too much of an attitude of entitlement, and that is carried well beyond age 21. So in that are, maturity should be pressed sooner. But drinking, driving, and voting are not in the category of things that ought to be put to younger ages. What sots out the cases is the penalties to the person and to society by the privilege being carried out irresponsibly by a person not able to evaluate consequences.Because individuals mature at different rats, I think there may be a place for testing to determine qualifications. Perhaps I stringent simulator test that includes applying judgment in dangerous situations might qualify a younger person to drive, for example. I suppose even a voting test is theoretically possible. However this debate is solely about rights determined by age. Alcohol would not fit under any circumstances.C2. Unfairness to the young by those older?Pro argued that a reason for giving additional rights to 16 year-olds is that it is unfair for older people to deny them. That is the second of the two arguments advanced in Pro's case. My rebuttal to that argument is that it applies equally to any age at which rights are denied. Pro dropped that contention, so it stands refuted.Pro separately argues that having drinking, driving, and voting rights all granted at 18 poses problems of adjustment. He says that people may use too much alcohol if the privilege is long denied. I don't see any arguments for driving and voting privileges causing problems. First, the greatest adjustment, by far, is in providing for one's own well-being. That's not just earning a living, but making all the decisions about where to live, how to budget, and what to do with one's life. that'sthe real difficult adaptation, not drinking privileges. Driving is often necessary for independent living, but eighteen works fine for driving. Many people get by fine without drinking, but having a brain better suited to appreciating consequences makes maturity helpful, not harmful. The potential for addiction is also reduced.In terms of fascination with forbidden fruit, that can be satisfied by drinking in private, presumably under some supervision. \" ... only a few states prohibit minors and young adults from consuming alcohol in private settings.

Con makes two contention\u2019s and provides a counterplan. I will address each in turn. Con\u2019s case C1: Uniformed Voter\u2019s Con argues that uninformed voters harm the system and demonstrates that 17 year olds are likely be uninformed voters. The issue with this contention is that con does nothing to demonstrate 17 year olds any less informed than those who can vote. What con has demonstrated is the reality is many of those who can and do vote are not particularly \"politically savvy.\" Essentially con\u2019s contention here is against uneducated voting, not voting age. Thus, we see this contention entirely misses the mark. It seems to me that according to con\u2019s logic here, if someone is informed they ought to be able to vote. I am certain that con would not contend the fact that there are a few politically savvy teens that are informed enough to vote. Certainly savvy enough to pass an arbitrary test to vote. C2: Propoganda As with the first contention, this argument misses the mark. It addresses the issue of misinformation and voter manipulation. This is true of the status quo and is not going to be impacted by allowing 17 year olds to vote. Worse yet, con confirm this as he presented a source indicating that the average voter is usually uninformed and biased toward the political party with which they identify. Again, this contention has nothing to do with age but rather against voting in General. Con\u2019s Counter Plan Here con makes some inconstant and startling suggestions. In my estimation the worst being the suggestion of a type of metric or test to determine if those that do vote should be allowed to. Sound like Jim Crow laws to me. Not only does con want to keep 17 year olds oppressed, it sounds like he wants to take the vote away from other groups. Summary of Con\u2019s case Con has not addressed the issue at hand, both contentions address issues that are separate from age and thus do not negate the resolution. Con\u2019s counter plan is likely to restrict voting from young, old, and uneducated.

Take a look around your local community, Their are plenty of white kids wishin their black kids and black kids wishing they were white kids, it's all backwards it's identity crisis. I don't blame the government for not allowing kids around the age of 18 not to drink alcohol, half of them do not even have their priorities straight. My OPP stated, \"Reality: people who are under 21 right now, do drink. If the drinking age is lowered there won't be tendency for people underage to drink.\" Answer: This statement blows my mind! How can you assume this would solve the problem to underage drinking? You do realize that their are plenty of teens who begin drinking at the age of 15 right?!?! If the age is just to be lowered to 18, how much longer until the 15,16,17 year old people (In America) start debates like you are doing and begin complaining about how they are old enough and should be considered as adults. My OPP stated, \"In other countries, where the drinking age is lower, it is not a big hype to drink for them. There is less abuse of alcohol.\" Answer: Yes other countries do have the drinking age lower then that of the United States, but you have not supported any proof showing that the abuse of alcohol is lower.

However, if one still does not have complete rights. How can they be tried as adults?\" Answer: You are tried in the full court system rather than in a juvenile court system just because you are 18. The point is that you take full responsibility for your actions rather than the system acknowledging that your immaturity may detract from your personal accountability and external influences may have influenced you, further eliminating your personal responsibility. No one is tried as an adult with out physiological testing anyways. Basically you are old enough to understand right from wrong, and understand what you were doing at the time, and understand the ramifications.

Drinking is almost never good for society, even (as my opponent suggests) in moderation. -REFUTATIONS TO MY ARGUMENTS- \"\u2026society will progress without regard to a certain drinking age. Simply put, natural selection will always advance society and there will always be those who choose not to partake in drinking at any age. Therefore, society will have progress and is too big to be affected by under aged drinking laws.\" If this is true, then there is no reason for us to debate the issue. If there will be no effect on society, then it is futile to waste time and energy changing the status quo. This idea would work for the CON side, should it be true. Unfortunately, however, a change in the legal drinking age would encourage more drinking, which would affect society through higher levels of substance abuse, alcohol-related crime and accidents, and teen pregnancies. This is because the majority of Americans do follow the law and wait to drink until age 21. Until my opponent presents a survey of Americans showing that a majority of Americans do not wait to drink, then he cannot show that the current laws fail. -- \"Even now, in a place and time when people can only legally buy alcohol when over the age of 21, are there people who given their own personal characteristics are more likely to become alcoholics or have a drug problem. So should we penalize those people who are mature and responsible enough to handle the responsibility of drinking at an age lower than the current legal one of 21?\" There are always some members of society who are more prone to substance abuse problems than others. However, the Norberg study shows quite plainly that those individuals who chose to drink before age 21 were a third more likely to have problems with alcohol later in life, and 70% more likely to have drug problems.[1] By lowering the drinking age, we would allow substance abuse to increase much more rapidly and become more widespread than it is now. -- \"This contention made by my opponent, once again may be true. However, it falls outside the relevancy of our debate. We are once again arguing, lowering the drinking age will reduce drinking. Unplanned pregnancies by teenagers occur everyday. Sure teenagers may be under the influence of alcohol, but maybe we should be focusing more on sex education\u2026\" My opponent has conceded that my teen pregnancy contention is true. I agree that we are debating about lowering the drinking age. One effect of lowering the drinking age would be more frequent and widespread teen pregnancies, which is obviously a problem for the US. Sex education is a useful tool to combat teenage pregnancies, but that is irrelevant to this debate about the drinking age. -- \"And this leads back to my contention that teenagers most often binge drink when they do partake in illegal consumption. The idea of binge drinking in teenagers is built on the idea, that those who are under aged will consume large quantities of alcohol because they are only able to get alcohol once in a while or on special occasions, so therefore they are going to take advantage and drink larger quantities.\" Binge drinking will not be solved by lowering the drinking age. It will always happen; in fact, if we do lower the legal drinking age, we will only change the nature of binge drinking from a phenomenon among college students to a phenomenon among high schoolers. This can be seen not only logically, but also in other countries. if we lower the drinking age to 18 or even 16, drinking will become more important for high schoolers, because they will have more contact with alcohol. This will encourage them to begin \"bingeing,\" which will be more serious because of their younger age. Newsweek reported in September 2008 that \"In England and Germany, where the drinking age is already 18, bingeing is also a growing problem.\"[2] -- \"And this more than likely leads to actions resulting in possible pregnancies, which could be avoided if the drinking age were lowered, thus changing the social status quo towards drinking to be more responsible and controlled.\" A lowered drinking age will only encourage drinking at a younger age, which will lead to even more substance abuse problems and pregnancies in even younger children. -REFUTATIONS TO MY OPPONENT'S ARGUMENTS- I. Service in the Armed Forces & Alcohol \"In my first contention, no where did I mention that consumption of alcohol by our service men and women would be 'beneficial' \u2026 Is it beneficial for our service men and women to be serving at all? Is it beneficial for them to be allowed to smoke or chew tobacco? Is it beneficial for them to have bullets whizzing by their heads? Is it beneficial for the psychological damage that they may incur? No it may not be beneficial for them to consume alcohol, at 18 or at 21, but if they are experiencing all these other things, why not be allowed to legally partake in the consumption of an alcoholic beverage?\" My opponent has not explained why being put in a dangerous war zone should allow members of them military to drink a glass of beer. What I explained in Round 1, and what my opponent completely ignored, is that there are unique harms associated with drinking at a young age, whereas military service is equally dangerous at 18 as it is at 27. \"If our military, the most powerful and possibly well organized and respected, can trust that the responsibility of an 18 year old is good enough to go to war, then why can't we trust their responsibility in terms of alcohol consumption?\" It is not that we cannot trust them, but that it would be dangerous to their health and general well-being to drink alcohol. II. Binge Drinking As I stated earlier this round, lowering the drinking age will cause a shift in the population that partakes in binge drinking, so that it will then be 16 year olds who drink at such unhealthy quantities. My opponent seems to have misunderstood the idea that underage Americans have access to alcohol through older friends. This actually shows that, if we lower the drinking age, younger and younger teenagers would begin drinking. That would be especially harmful because the younger a person is, the more harmful alcohol is. III. Teaching of Responsible Drinking Habits In response to my ideas about his third conention, my opponent only restates what he already told us in Round 1. Unfortunately, this remains illogical and untrue. A lower drinking age will foster more early drinking. Early drinking leads to drug problems[1] and unplanned teen pregnancies.[3] Parents who are addicted to dangerous substances and who are unready to raise children in the first place will not even begin to teach their young ones responsible habits. This is from where the moral degradation derives. IV. Law Enforcement Resources My opponent continues to believe that teenage drinking is not a serious problem. He also twisted my analogy without looking at its real meaning: he is advocating that the US make a crime legal, so that we don't have to \"waste\" resources enforcing the law. So, should we also make murder or armed robbery legal? Aren't we wasting resources arresting those criminals, too? Shoplifting and underage drinking can most definitely be compared. They are both crimes. -SUMMARY- Drinking is a serious problem in our society that must be curbed. The policy that my opponent supports will only encourage underage drinking, which causes substance abuse and unplanned teen pregnancies, among other devastating harms. Binge drinking will increase and unhealthy habits will be taught to children. For all of these reasons, I urge you to vote CON. [1] http://www.nlm.nih.gov... [2] http://www.newsweek.com...

He said that America is about what the people want, and that a popular vote would be what the people want. But that is based on a false assumption that we are a direct democracy, which we are not. We are a republic, so we don't do direct popular votes. Also, he said that since everybody's vote counts, presidents must campaign everywhere. But why would they campaign everywhere when they could just campaign in the big cities of one region and win the election by dominating that region? My opponent also stated that their is no connection that would make small states lower their voting age. But their is. Since presidents are only going to campaign in the cities with lots of people that can vote for them, the small states would lower their voting age so that they have more eligible voters so presidents might come to their cities.

Lastly, you said that the electoral college can tie, and that if the House/Senate is favored towards a party, then they will give it to that candidate. But remember, WE elect the people of the House and Senate. If they're biased, that's our mistake in voting for them. Also, the electoral college ties were in 1800 and 1824!

Most teens live with their parents, and their political beliefs are based on their parents. So teens shouldn't be able to vote. Lastly, the true \"adult\" age is around 23, because that's when the brain is fully developed.

Also I looked up your argument here, and little evidence came up with it. \"In addition, other shorter-term studies found that the rates of DUI accidents, other drinking behaviors, suicides, and homicides were higher in states with lower drinking ages.\" [2] Now, this shows that higher drinking ages lower the amount of driving accidents. This is a great find, areas with higher drinking ages have less accidents, hence a higher drinking age is better. Also, as the source mentions, states with higher drinking ages have less mental disorders linked to alcohol. [2] This means it decreases youth users, which logically ----> less accidents. In the same study, it shows that a lower drinking age deceases suicides. [3] This is logical as drinking causes suicidal actions sometimes.

I will first disprove your arguments, and then make a few closing comments. First, you say that the 21 mandatory minimum age is unconstitutional. However, although the MLDA act was made by Congress, it is each states' option to pass it or fail it in their own state. The reason why all 50 states did was because they saw the risks of making a minimum drinking age under 21 and the dangers that would occur to their law-abiding citizens. Next, you say that lowering the drinking age would have no real danger on society and other Americans' lives and liberties, however, this could not be farther from the truth. According to the American Medical Association, there was a 141% increase in DWI accidents in states that had a MLDA of 18 years old. By lowering the drinking age, you greatly increase the risks of accidents on the road, showing just how much lowring the MLDA would harm society. In addition, traffic fatalities increased 35% in these sates, which just shows how dangerous the road would be. Your next argument states that by lowering the age, it would reduce binge drinking later on in life, as that is what happens in Europe. While this makes sense, in America this wouldn't work. A New York study showed that those who drank at earlier ages were in fact MORE likely to drink heavier in college and throughout their life. So instead of decreasing binge drinking, a lower MLDA would in fact INCREASE the likelihood of that happening. To close, I feel that lowering the minimum legal drinking age would be a blatant violation of vast amount of Americans' lives liberties and pursitus of happiness. I feel that it would only harm America and all of her people, and is not only unconstitutional, but a bad idea on the whole.

Many studies conclude 20,000 lives are saved from a higher (21) drinking age, and all due to the 21 drinking age. [1]\"Drunk-driving crashes have been on the decline, and one reason for this is the drinking age. According to a new study conduced by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE), the law that implemented a national uniform drinking age of 21 contributed to a declining percentage of alcohol-related teen traffic deaths. The study notes an 11 percent drop in these traffic deaths. \" [2]\"New Zealand recently lowered the drinking age based on many of the same arguments advanced by the Amethyst Initiative. The result was more alcohol-involved traffic crashes and emergency room visits among 15- to 19-year-olds. New Zealand is now considering raising its drinking age. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that setting the drinking age at 21 saves the lives of 900 young people each year and has saved more than 25,000 lives since 1975.\" [3]\"Congress mandated in 1984 that states establish 21 as the drinking age in return for federal highway funding. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that the 21 drinking age has reduced traffic fatalities involving drivers 18 to 20 years old by 13 percent and saves approximately 900 lives a year. Overall, the number of U.S. teenagers involved in fatal drunk-driving accidents has declined 11 percent because of laws that raised the legal drinking age to 21.\" [4]Sorry for quoting, just am tired and the quotes do it for me :P Here are a few facts: Lower drinkign age in Arizona lead to a a 25% more of a chance of a fatal car accicent and 35% chance of traffic fatalities [6] Lowering drinking age in massechuses lead to increased fatalities [4] In areas with a lower drinking age there was a 9% higher suicide rate linked to alcohol [4] 2. The younger you drink the worse problems you encounter 4 more time likely to get alcoholism and 2 times more likely to get addicted to those age 21 (18-12 comparison) [5] 12 times more likely to ge tinjured while using alcohol [4] 7 times more likley to get in a car crash while younger and drunk compared to 21 year olds. [4] 10 times more likely to get into a fight while drinking. [4] Further, the younger people begin to drink also may be linked to other illicit drug usages, as many studies showt the younger you drink the more likley you are to get involved with other harmful substances, many illegal. [4] Further, this applies as many are getting pregnant earlier, that the alcoholism and alcohol use when youngr has a higher chance of harming the bayby the person has. [4] So it not only harms them and their freinds, but maybe unborn people. Now, lets look at how it effect the youth. As stated, they are at increased risk for death, yes death, the lower the age they drink. [7] \"Research has also shown that youth who use alcohol before age 15 are five times more likely to become alcohol dependent than adults who begin drinking at age 21. Other consequences of youth alcohol use include increased risky sexual behaviors, poor school performance, and increased risk of suicide and homicide.\" [7] I showed lower suidide rates for states with higher drinking ages, so we can assume there is lower users (my next point). This point is done, youths are not fully deveoped and a lower drinkign age would hurt them. 3. Lowers Users http://www.tobacco21.org...... http://www.tobacco21.org... We can see in 1977, drinking age 18, then in the 80s when states raised to 21 users declined. Also, making it illegal for minors to have alcohol creates a detterent effect. Summary: Younger people that use drugs face more of a chance of alcohol abuse [8] Younger people that do alcohol are more likely to do drugs and commit crime Higher rinkign age lowers DWI Arrests A higher drinking age lowers users Lower drinking age kills people by traffic fatalities and crime Higher age lowers traffic fatalities and suicide + crime CONCLUSION: See summary, then add the vote PRO and a higher drinking age is better.

The resolution which I intended to defend is the following: \"LR4N6FTW4EVA is a teenager, and as a teenager he is recognized by society and law as being without life experience or education and is prone to foolishness.\" I will be making frequent references to the laws and constitution of the United States of America, so I ask that readers from other nations forgive me for not including the views of their societies on teenagers. Our society does not recognize the capability of teenagers to make good judgments, and there are many ways in which we do it. I will start with lofty national and philosophical considerations, and then proceed into lower levels, while examining the ages which are recognized. Federal levels tend to require older, wiser, and more experienced individuals than state and local authorities do. Let me bare witness to the fact that LR4N6FTW4EVA is a teenager. His own profile dictates such: \"15-year old male in Hydes, Maryland, United States.\" First and foremost, I present to you the United States Constitution. A document which provides numerous considerations to the qualifications of age with regards to leadership and the ability to participate in the very basic level of our governmental franchise. To be the President of the United States of America, there is a minimum age requirement of 35. Indicating that our society does not believe that a person under the age of 35 should ever serve as the commander in chief of our military, nor the executive of our government. To be a United States Senator, there is a minimum age requirement of 30. Indicating that our society does not feel that an individual is capable of making complicated decisions regarding legislation and foreign policy until they are at least thirty. Any other qualification is not considered until they are able to be legally sworn in at the age of 30. Given the very formal and polite nature of discourse between United States Senators, and on the floor of the Senate it is clear that they believe that you are not able to act in good conduct with your gentleman peers until you are likewise 30. To be a member of the United States House of Representatives, you are required to be no less than 25 years old at the time of your oath of office. This is an indicator that our society believes that you are not able to make decisions regarding national budget priorities, nor does our nation accept are you able to represent or serve your constituents until you have experienced 25 years of life at a bare minimum. Initially in the United States it was law that an American citizen must be of 21 years of age in order to vote for holders of federal office. This is an indicator that when this nation first formed, and for many decades after that it was believed that a teenager of any age was not of world experience, intellect, nor wisdom enough to make decisions which impact every citizen, and the nation as a whole. It was recently decided in the latter half of the last century that since we were conscripting American citizens starting at the age of 18 that we should also lower the voting age to 18. The result of a lowering of the voting age has been arguably some of the worst and least effective Presidents in American history, Carter, Reagan, and Bush Jr. Gone are the days of electing statesmen such as Eisenhower, and FDR. This may not be a direct correlation, but perhaps shows that society over all has become less responsible and it has been expressed by lowering the voter age to the teen years. The Drinking age in this country was once a pretty standard 19 years old from State to State. It was increased to 21 years of age after the realization that 19 year olds were making alcohol much more accessible to young folks, who willingly and recklessly broke the law. It has been decided as a society that teenagers are ill equipped to be responsible enough to regulate their own consumption of alcohol. Cigarettes are not allowed to be purchased by individuals under the age of 18, because the same society has decided that teenagers are not able to make such important decisions regarding their own health. In many states, the restrict a teenager's ability to work and drive. In Iowa, for example, a person must be 18 years old to work past 10:00 PM, and there are curfews in place for drivers under the age of eighteen. The typical student does not usually complete their basic high school level education until the age of eighteen, at which point they have not been specialized in anything, nor do many have the opportunity to attend college lectures and classes, and be a part of leadership opportunities available to college students. It takes many more years of schooling to get a bachelors degree, and typically programs for a Masters degree take a year to three years depending on the subject, and while some Ph.D.s are completed in a couple of additional years, in some subjects it can take another five to seven years of graduate school to complete your course work and dissertation. While intelligence is an important factor in a persons ability to learn, it takes a substantial amount of time to review the course work required to become traditionally considered an educated person. A teenager simply has not had the time to develop their education. In fact, many teenagers are prone to quickly dismiss the education of their elders rather than respect the time that it takes to develop a broad education. The clearest distinction that our society shows to the fact that teenagers are considered to be without life experience, appropriate education, and are prone to foolishness is the existence of a separate court and judicial system for minors. It is presumed that teenagers will be less familiar with the laws of their society, so their punishments are less sever. They are expected to be foolish, so we do not hold them to the same level of responsibility that we hold offending adults to. And sometimes, the child simply doesn't know any better. In my closing argument of round 1, let me simply remind all of your of the simple adage, \"With age comes experience.\" That is why the laws and structure of our society reflect the fact that teenagers are of little life experience, of little education, and are typically foolish.", "qid": 48, "docid": "6ec0d360-2019-04-18T19:37:25Z-00005-000", "score": 6.992700099945068}, {"content": "Title: The drinking age should be lowered to 18 (redone) Content: The point I was trying to make with the voting is a matter of responsibility; an 18 year-old is able to vote in the most powerful person on the face of the planet, and will ultimately shape their own futures based on that decision and many other decisions that are normal for a young adult to make. However, despite all of that they are unable to legally consume alcohol. It seems inconsistent to entrust them with some of the responsibilities of an adult, but not all of them.

First off, I just want to provide some perspective to how drinking policy is handled globally. Below is a list of countries that have their drinking at a minimum of 21 years old:C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Iraq, Kiribati, Micronesia, Mongolia, Nauru, Oman, Palau, Samoa, Sri Lanka, & United States...none of our peers [5].All other first world countries and most developing countries have their drinking age corrisponding with legal voting age.I'm going to make three arguments against the USA minimum drinking age of 21.Federal Coercion Drinking age is state mandated...but federally manipulated. The traditional democratic process was completely robbed from you!In 1971, Congress passed the 26th amendment [1], which changed the voting age to 18. In response, most states dropped the drinking age from 21 to 18. This was pushed by a wave of youth activists in the wake of the Vietnam War with the idea that if 18 is old enough to die, they should be able to vote and drink. Seems sensible. Due to reports that concluded an increase in alcohol related traffic deaths of young adults after the lowered drinking age, Ronald Regan bypassed traditional State control and passed the federally imposed National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. Because Congress or the Executive branch lack the actual power to change the drinking age, Regan directs the Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of otherwise allocable federal highway funds from States \"in which the purchase or public possession . . . of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than twenty-one years of age is lawful.\" [2] Whether or not a State\"s accident rate is effected by 18-21 drinking, this situation currently stands. A State can legally change its minimum drinking age below 21, but would suffer a withholding of 10% of its federal highway funding. Several states sued the government (see South Dakota vs. Dole) on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, breaking the 21st Amendment [3], the States right to control intoxicating liquors. Something that was put into place after \"lessons learned\" from Prohibition. SCOTUS acknowledged the federally imposed workaround, but let the indirect minimum drinking law stand on the ground that it couldn\"t interfere with Congress\"s right \"to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.\" [2]Some might say the democratic process to change the age still exists. A State could legally lower to 18, take the funding hit, and be completely within their rights. But this doesn\"t happen. Generally, people care less about the rights of our youth, due to adultism, and embrace the idea of the police handling their parenting for the first couple years their children leave the nest. Unethical The 18-21 year old range is a small minority of our population. Apart from being one of the least experienced groups in influencing politics, they do not have the representation to affect their legal circumstances. The decision to \"protect\" under 21\"s from alcohol is made by an outside majority that used the reasoning of keeping young adults out of harm. Ironically, that same majority has decided not to spare them, war or execution based on the fact that they are considered competent adults. This is the definition of hypocrisy. Saying one thing, while doing another. As of December 31, 2004, 71 persons were on death row for juvenile crimes. This means the crimes were committed while the offender was 16 or 17 [4]. If protecting our youth is our main concern, why does it only extend to their right to drink? Answer: self-interest. For the majority of our population is fills two needs. The legal extension of parenting and adult disdane for youth culture. There is not an ethnic/racial minority today that our country would treat in the same way. They have full responsibility, up to the point of being trusted and allowed to kill in other countries on our behalf, but deny them simple access to alcohol. Criminalizing Social Norms Creates Unnecessary CriminalsNot only is there inconsistency in how to protect young adults, but also our cultural norms in relation to the law. For example, marijuana is a federally illegal substance, but our last three presidents have admitted to using it. Why don\"t we care? Why do we care more about where Obama was born than the fact that he willingly broke the law? Because it is socially acceptable to try pot. In the same vein, a certain amount of underage drinking is expected from most kids. On one hand you have a culture that fully embraces and lionizes alcohol in media, and then you try to counter act this by heavy penalty for certain groups of people that are deemed too irresponsible to use it properly. Who does this protect? Most of these penalties are financial, which this group of people really can\"t supply. An underage drinking charge will affect your car insurance rates for 10 years in most states!1.

Pro has tried to shift the debate to a quite different topic: \"My position today is simple - that 18 is not a justifiable boundary.\" and \"I'd like to have a serious chat to whoever came up with the age of 18 for voting. It's completely arbitrary. \"First, this debate is not over whether or not 18 is the appropriate age to allow one to vote, second, Con actually agrees with Pro that 18 is a fairly arbitrary age and, in fact, Con will show that 18 is probably too young of an age. But whether or not 18+ is an appropriate age is irrelevant to this debate. This debate is whether or not 15-17 year olds should also have the right to vote. If Con shows that no one under the age of 30 should be allowed to vote, then Con has effectively won this case (as an example). Pro does not need to defend 18+ year olds, but they must show that 15-17 year olds being allowed to debate is better than not allowing them.Due to space requirements, Con will now present a counter case as to why teenagers (15-17) should not be allowed to vote. In Round 3 Con will present refutations to arguments made by Pro in round 2 (which are mostly circular--i.e. they assume teens make for good voters which will be directly called into question in this round).I will quickly summarize the points I intend to make. Pro makes the argument that 18 is an arbitrary age--then why do they insist on 15? Why not 14 or 12 or 10 or 5? Pro gives no rationale for when they think one becomes \"rational\" enough to vote. Next, Pro makes most of their arguments under the presupposed assumption that 15-17 year olds are not irrational (making this argument somewhat circular). Con will make a case that shows, in fact that 15-17 year olds (and even higher ages) are actually scientifically proven to be irrational. Con reminds voters that whether or not 18+ (for instance 18-25) should be allowed to vote is irrelevant to this case, so even if Con makes arguments that 18-25 year olds shouldn't be allowed to vote is irrelevant to this case (if 18-25 shouldn't vote, then clearly 15-17 shouldn't be allowed to vote either).So what would a country want out of a voter? This is the question that must be answered by Pro, first and foremost. In Con's opinion a voter should be well informed, rational thinking, and have a stake in the outcome of an election. Con will now show that teenagers (15-17) do not meet at least two of these criteria.1) Teenagers living at home with their parents have less of a stake in the outcome of elections.I think it's fairly uncontested that the vast majority of teenagers live at home with their parents and do not support themselves. This means teens do not pay taxes (other than sales taxes), do not have an independent stream of income (meaning their contribution via sales tax is actually their parents' money), and do not support themselves. As such, policy decisions about income tax, property taxes, welfare, etc. do not have direct effects on teens.2) Teens are irrational human beings and their brains are not fully developed.An ideal voter would be able to make calculated decisions about cause and effect--they would be able to see how complex policies would effect long term outcomes. Unfortunately, teen brains are still developing and this ongoing development makes it difficult for teens to make such judgment decisions.I would expect most (older) voters to assume this prima facie: that teens are irrational, impulsive, and have very little self control. However, a) this is likely unconvincing to younger voters and b) this sentiment does not make it true! So is there any evidence to support this idea? In fact there is overwhelming scientific evidence to support this idea [1, 2, 3, 4]. This comes from the fact that teenagers rely mostly on their amygdala for decision making whereas adults tend to use their frontal cortex in decision making.\"Their[teenagers] actions are guided more by the amygdala and less by the frontal cortex.\" [1]\"The researchers found that when processing emotions, adults have greater activity in their frontal lobes than do teenagers. Adults also have lower activity in their amygdala than teenagers. In fact, as teenagers age into adulthood, the overall focus of brain activity seems to shift from the amygdala to the frontal lobes.\" [2]\"And she says that adults process information in the rational prefrontal cortex. But, in the teen brain, most of the heavy lifting is done by the emotion-oriented limbic center.\" [3]\"The part of the brain that helps us make logical and rational decisions is just developing in a teen and usually it's not fully functional until the early to mid-20s. \" [4]The amygdala is more associated with impulse reactions and \"gut\" feelings:\" The frontal lobes are also thought to be the place where decisions about right and wrong, as well as cause-effect relationships are processed. In contrast, the amygdala is part of the limbic system of the brain and is involved in instinctive \"gut\" reactions, including \"fight or flight\" responses.\" [2]This last quote is particularly important, as it shows that the frontal lobe is where cause-effect relationships are processed. This is paramount in making political decisions! One must understand the effect that certain policies will cause. If they do not, then they are not likely to make for very good voters. As this research suggests, teenagers are not the type of people we want in determining policy through becoming voters. It's not some \"arbitrary\" age limit--this is scientific evidence to suggest that teenagers are not \"mature\" enough to make such decisions.The next problem with allowing teens to vote is that they are not independent thinkers. Teens tend to support whatever their parents support. Again, there is overwhelming evidence to support this fact.\"According to Boquist, \"Family is the primary agent of political socialization. It's usually not purposeful and has to do with absorption.\"\" [5] This shows that while families influence political beliefs, there does not tend to be a rational reason behind it.\"Research shows that children tend to share their parents\u2019 political attitudes\u2014at least while they\u2019re all still living under the same roof, said UW-Madison political science professor Charles Franklin.\" [6]Again, notice the important caveat: \"at least while they\u2019re all still living under the same roof\". This is true of virtually all teenagers from the agers of 15-17.Finally, there is empirical evidence to show that 70% of children hold the same political belief as their parents. Specifically, 70% of children would vote the same way as their parents (77% for republicans, 71% for democrats, and 61% for independents) [7].So what does this prove? It shows that allowing teens (15-17) to vote does nothing to increase democracy, rather just works to reward parents with many children and whom tend to strictly enforce their views onto their children. So this essentially has no effect, other than giving parents with children a few extra votes for their particular ideal. Teens will not make independent, well-informed decisions.

Now, there do certainly exist politically savvy teenagers who are able to make intelligent voting decisions, but I will argue that, for the most part, people under the age of eighteen, especially the children and infants, are subject to ideological indoctrination due to their lack of intellectual maturity, and are most likely going to just copy the political opinions of their parents. What eliminating age restrictions does, then, is that it gives individuals with children the ability to double, triple, or even quadruple their say in the government by indoctrinating their children to cast their votes a certain way! This is absolutely unfair to all of the nation's other individuals, who only get one ballot per person. Thus, eliminating age restrictions undermines one of the core tenets of democracy: that all citizens should have an equal say in the government.Now, on to Pro's contentions...A. Voter EligibilityPro argues that since historically we have been eliminating restrictions on voting, including the gender and race restrictions, we should go ahead and remove the age restriction too. However, there is an obvious problem with this... race and gender have no demonstrable effect on one's ability to have independent political opinions, whereas age most certainly does. And, extending the logic presented in the neg case, that lack of intellectual independence means that age restrictions are mandatory in order to avoid inequality in representation B. Taxation without RepresentationPro: \"As one of the causes of the American revolution, \"taxation without representation\" was viewed as tyranny. Yet today if you are under the age of 18 and you have a job making money you are required to pay and income tax. Third from the bottom on this link shows those under the age of 18 still pay taxes. (2) This is Tyranny, but would not be if they had representation via voting rights.\"This may seem like a valid argument at first, but upon closer inspection, it is baseless. \"Taxation without representation\" is just a phrase with some historical significance; Pro has not provided any real Constitutional basis for us to believe that all instances of 'taxation without representation' need to be disallowed. And it certainly is not viewed as \"tyranny\" anymore, as Pro claims; non-citizen residents of the United States are not allowed to vote in federal elections, yet they are all still taxed quite regularly [1][2], and there hasn't really been any substantial resistance to the practice...This contention is completely founded on the unwarranted assumption that all instances of \"taxation without representation\" are bad.C. The purpose of voting D. Every citizen should have the right to voteBoth of Pro's points here are based in abstract, idealistic logic. I can just cross-apply my initial case here to show that the practical harms that allowing minors to vote causes is enough to override such logic.And anyways, in both contentions, Pro supports the assumptions underlying them with random quotes by notable politicians, which is definitely NOT sufficient warrant for us to accept them.All of Pro's contentions have been refuted, and the neg case still stands. The resolution has been negated.SOURCES[1] http://www.irs.gov...[2] http://www.irs.gov...", "qid": 48, "docid": "bda53b78-2019-04-18T15:58:35Z-00002-000", "score": 6.970900058746338}, {"content": "Title: Should kids at age 16 be able to vote Content: Thanks for this amzing reply.

In pilot projects where body cameras worn by police officers have been implemented and studied, complaints against officers have dropped over 90%. (Source: http://cjb.sagepub.com...) -Further expanding on the point of cameras being a tool to defuse situations, they will improve officer safety as subjects will be aware that their actions will be recorded on camera and those recordings could be used as evidence against them. -While cost is sometimes cited as an argument against the implementation of police body cameras, lawsuits against police agencies for misconduct can be extremely expensive for the agencies and the government bodies that oversee them. Body cameras can capture evidence that can discredit false complaints against officers and can prevent frivolous lawsuits from succeeding or forcing governments to provide unnecessary settlements. -Individual officers themselves are protected from false accusations in the form of complaints or lawsuits if they behave professionally and appropriately and their conduct is captured through body cameras.

However, throughout mankind, there has been a series of crimes gone unsolved and detectives failing to solve assigned mysteries. Sadly, all have been failing to notice the very blatant solution to all of these. A way to ensure public safety and solve crimes is right in front of us and the proposition team wants this resolution to be implemented. Hello, I am Forever 23 and I am going to debate pro on the topic that police officers should not wear body cameras. I will first provide definitions and then introduce my own points. Body cameras- The cameras put on the uniforms of the police officers. They are of very high quality and NOT easily breakable. Now onto my own points.1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. Racial apartheid in the police force may seem impossible and implausible. However, that is the current reality. Today\u2019s world criminal justice system is not at all filled with justice. In fact, many times, the fortune and faith of the one convicted will depend on his race, ethnicity and skin color. Cameras however, will provide a much more objective view on the situation. Nothing can bestow more truth than the situation itself on a video. . http://www.discoverthenetworks.org..., \"Los Angeles congresswoman Max Waters thinks that the system is racist, she stated that \u201cthe color of your skin dictates whether you will be arrested or not, prosecuted harshly or less harshly, or receive a stiff sentence or gain probation or entry into treatment. \u201d The late law professor Derrick Bell claimed that the justice system \u201cdisempowers people of color. \u201d At a presidential primary debate in 2008, Barack Obama charged that blacks and whites \u201care arrested at very different rates, are convicted at very different rates, [and] receive very different sentences . .. for the same crime. \u201d That same night, Senator Hillary Clinton likewise disgrace the \u201cdisgrace of a criminal-justice system that incarcerates so many more African-Americans proportionately than whites. \u201d\"The only way to ensure honesty in our justice and jurisdiction system is by having objective footage. The \u201che did it because he is African American\u201d approach is not the way to go. The only way to make this system more fair to those of different races and skin colors is by implementing cameras. The real video will show what really happened, not from different people\u2019s point of view. The video is better than any testimony. Since, African Americans are judged many times by the skin color in court, they mostly get unfair punishments. In order for the punishment to fit the crime and to know what the crime even is, we need cameras on officers. Cameras on police officers will stop deliberate, false accusations against African Americans and make the justice system much more stronger and efficient. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. . http://www.cam.ac.uk..., \"Knowledge that events are being recorded creates \"self-awareness\" in all participants during police interactions. This is the critical component that turns body-worn video into a 'preventative treatment': causing individuals to modify their behaviour in response to an awareness of 'third-party' surveillance by cameras acting as a proxy for legal courts\u2014as well as courts of public opinion\u2014should unacceptable behaviour take place. According to, . http://phys.org..., \" During the 12-month Rialto experiment, use-of-force by officers wearing cameras fell by 59% and reports against officers dropped by 87% against the previous year's figures. . http://www.cam.ac.uk... \"The 'preventative treatment' of body-worn-video is the combination of the camera plus both the warning and cognition of the fact that the encounter is being filmed. In the tragic case of Eric Garner, police weren't aware of the camera and didn't have to tell the suspect that he, and therefore they, were being filmed,\" said Dr Barak Ariel, from the Cambridge's IoC, who conducted the crime experiment with Cambridge colleague Dr Alex Sutherland and Rialto police chief Tony Farrar. The belief in police officers is at an all time low. That is quite harrowing because officers are the ones who protect us and safeguard us. People seeing officers as pernicious is not the way to benefit our society. In fact, many people dislike police force because of the utmost use of force. With officers being aware about the cameras strapped to their chest, they will be less likely to provide a criminal with unjustified force and more likely to do their jobs with fairness and the not needed force. That will result us in a much stronger police system and at the end, a stronger nation itself. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. The people of the USA see the benefits of the propositions plan. The majority of the US citizens want to see the plan in action. They want to ensure a safer future by not only arming officers with guns, but also giving them cameras to record the happening events. Judge, we need to listen to our public and make the safe. We should give the people what they want because in this particular case, the implementation of cameras will provide support to the security and democracy of the public. According to Huffington Post, 56% of voters stated that police body cameras would be beneficial to the police force. 13% stated that it will protect the unalienable rights of the US citizens. 25% of the poll takers figured that it would invade the privacy of people.6% figured that the officers should have the choice. 65,064 votes were supporting the resolution and 28,272 were considering this an invasion of privacy. . http://www.nbcnews.com..., Tracey Knight, community liaison and PR officer for the Fort Worth Police Department, told NBC News. \"However, more and more officers are requesting to have one issued to them and some have even purchased their own. \"The people want it! The officers want it! The officials want it! The question is, then why not? Most people from different areas including the police officers themselves are willing to record the data happening on the streets. They are willing to have objective, documented footage. People are waiting to switch from the \u201che did it\u201d and the \u201cno I did not\u201d approach. The citizens of the USA are willing to make this nation change for the better and with the substantial support and assistance, the propositions plan will be able to function and even support the stance on majority decides. The propositions team plan is to make it required by law for every police officer to wear the Trascendent ProDrive Body 10 Body Camera. It will be very effective for this cause. I will further expand on this in the 2nd proposition speech.", "qid": 49, "docid": "f4135ff7-2019-04-18T14:01:54Z-00005-000", "score": 11.513199806213379}, {"content": "Title: Police Officers should wear Body Cameras while on duty at all times. Content: Today as the con, I am going to prove to you that police officers should not wear body cameras while on duty at all times. My value today is morality. The reason why this is my value because I am going o prove that it is immoral to wear a body camera as it harms the people's rights, and the community as a whole. Contention 1: Body cameras are seen as an invasion of privacy. When body cameras are on, they will capture all civilian and police behavior. Now, not all people would like this. Some people find it very uncomfortable to be recorded while talking, as they find it invades privacy. Current law prevents a search, which invades privacy, and would everyone is not exactly comfortable for recording them, which will be there forever, and it is an embarrassing memory. Contention 2: Body cameras cost too much. A single camera costs about $350. Many small areas do not have the money and resources to provide these cameras for EVERY officer. Doing so would put the budget at a very uncomfortable position, and it leads for more debt to rise. Contention 3: A camera will never replace a whole investigation. Yes, it might replace many witnesses, but witnesses are more reliable. Witnesses can see 3-D, a camera can only see 2-D. A camera can not provide sole truth for the event because we still need a fair, through investigation. A recording shows 2-D, which only shows around. What we do no know is what really happened because we still need second guessing, and it will take much longer. It also gives a lot of the playing of the should've-couldn't game and a lot of guessing, instead of real testimonies. So with these reasons and many more, police officers should not wear body cameras while on duty. I respectfully, but strongly urge you to put a vote in the Con side today. `TheResistance", "qid": 49, "docid": "431b936a-2019-04-18T14:11:36Z-00006-000", "score": 11.415499687194824}, {"content": "Title: The philippines should continue the \"Kill on sight if armed\" law against criminals.

Considering you said -which is not all that surprising seeing how poor our economy is-, this might simply not be a feasible solution for your country. Of course situations do and will happen that could put police at risk, and a solution for that is not so easy. If the economy improves, body cameras would be a good idea. A temporary solution I could see working is, instead of outright allowing officers to kill on sight, if they or someone else provides a video of the advent which shows the officer is at risk and kills they would be pardoned on the spot. Also, in the advent that deadly force need not be necessary, for instance a suspect running at the officer with a knife, carrying a strong police grade pepper spray may be a better choice. Now none of this would solve all your countries problems overnight, but could still be a good start. I have my own strong opinions on how drugs should be handled so I will give my ideas for that. First of all, drug addicts should not be punished. Drug addiction is a mental illness that is very hard for someone to kick, I have watched my own sister fight drug addiction and seen firsthand how hard it is. Often the very act of starting isn't a direct choice for addicts at all, but rather started due to other mental illnesses. My sister started drugs while bipolar, severely depressed and suicidal, with severe ADHD. Not to say at all nothing should be done, but that is the wrong target. Drug addicts should have mandatory treatment if caught with drugs, and that is a much more lasting solution. The real target should be the drug dealers, and they should get a punishment fitting of someone who lives off of ruining people\u2019s lives. For each proven sale they should be charged with assault, and any proven overdoses murder. For lasting change more than just hard drugs should be targeted, but also tobacco and alcohol, as for most addicts that is what they start with.", "qid": 49, "docid": "1733c744-2019-04-18T12:03:59Z-00002-000", "score": 11.30519962310791}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: Police officers should be required to wear body cameras Content: His refutation to my first point was that. We never stated the the crimes were fair. In fact, the opposition has completely misunderstood and obfuscated the simple argument that it will ensure a fair punishment to the criminal. Afterall, after seeing the situation, the decision makers will see what punishment fits the crime. And well of course, the punishment will in no way be unfair. If an unfair verdict is passed, there is always the video for evidence and the very simple statement can be said: Based on the video, the verdict was to strict/lax. He deserves a fair punishment since his rights are protected under the 8th amendment. Next, he refuted my majority point by saying that society may sometimes consider something wrong, right. He gave a few completely irrelevant examples. Such as, Nazi Germany. However, there is a very blatant difference between these to cases. The main difference is that the genocide was NOT made to HELP the public. It was a very obvious detriment. Here however, the public supports a movement which is supposed to ensure equality, and the use of less police force. In addition, the people did NOT support Nazi Germany. That is why brave soldiers from the US, Russia, France, England, etc have fought and risked their lives in order to end the terror. The second point, about the decreased use of duress remains standing as it was not refuted by the opposing side. Now, to restate my own points, introduce a new point and finally expand on my plan. So, my points were:1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police.3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. Now onto a new assertion:4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States. The opposition case in this debate will mostly be pointing out the ineffectiveness of these cameras, the costs and even uselessness. But in order for this plan to be successful, the police department must find the correct camera, find the most cheapest and yet efficient product and finally do more tests to find the effect of these cameras. If we do not take a serious approach to this situation, this plan will be a fail. However, with the right equipment, this system will run very well and efficiently. . http://www.bhphotovideo.com..., Record your every move with the DrivePro Body 10 Body Camera from Transcend, ideal for security personnel like bodyguards and police officers.

Overall judge, throwing this idea into the trash can because of expenses and trouble finding the correct camera is such a waste. If the government puts some thought into this idea, it will happen. The prices are not as extreme as the opposition may suggest as shown in the evidence. In addition, the cameras brought for these practical prices provide with a clear image that helps resolve the conflict in minutes just by watching this video. Overall, judge the body cameras will have a major effect on the issue of abortheid in the justice system and duress used by police force. Simply, the decision of the court will be based of real objective footage. If something seemed or was unfair, just looking at the video would be proof. The punishment will start to truly fit the crime because once you have the video, the mass, nothing can really defy it. With body cameras strapped to their chests, police officers will second guess themselves and therefore will not use an excessive amount of force.", "qid": 49, "docid": "f4135ff7-2019-04-18T14:01:54Z-00003-000", "score": 11.22700023651123}, {"content": "Title: Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction Content: Wow... I'm incredibly sorry about my initial sources. I had the same debate with someone else, but he bailed. The old debate was automatically deleted, so I started a new one. I copy and pasted my previous opening statement from that page, and apparently the links didn't copy properly. Here are my actual sources: http://www.afscmeinfocenter.org... (this is the Rialto study my opponent mentioned) http://www.latimes.com... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... Getting on with my closing statement... Police body cameras are a step in the right direction for improving police practices. The evidence shows that police body cameras reduce the use of force and complaints levied against the police. Police body cameras would also be instrumental in protecting police officers against false allegations. In response to the point about victims and informants, my opponent has resorted to insults and anecdotal evidence (which hardly even relates to the point of traumatized victims anyway, as he was not such). Further, he has not supported his contention that cameras will offend traumatized victims with any evidence, just conjecture. My opponent seems to have a gut feeling that it is the case. Honestly, I can't see why a victim would be willing to talk with an LEO but be absolutely opposed to being on a body camera. This is what my opponent failed to prove. The footage would also be helpful in determining what exactly the victims initial responses were. What if they changed their story later on to help their case? My opponent is either failing to acknowledge or is downplaying the fact that discretion can be used poorly. LEOs have a lot of power. That power is meant to be held in check by their superiors. Just as you say discretion can be used to not enforce an unjust law, it can also be used in a corrupt or otherwise illegal manner. We should not give such massive amounts of power to LEOs and then refuse to supervise them and hold them accountable. Also, I will restate one of my previous points: the law enforcement hierarchy understands and respects the role of discretion. Your example of \"a kid dropping his candy wrapper on the ground should be fined $1000 for littering\" is, well, ridiculous. What police chief is going to look at that situation and demand swift justice? If he did, there would be riots.", "qid": 49, "docid": "dfae64e7-2019-04-18T13:40:27Z-00001-000", "score": 11.090100288391113}, {"content": "Title: Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction Content: Sources My opponent has listed 3 links that merely go to the front page of 3 news sites. These sources do not verify the existence of 3 different studies done on police body cams. He should be deducted source points for providing fake links, and punished accordingly. He should probably also be deducted conduct points, because I\"m only aware of one major study done on police body cams. I assume he lied about the number of studies found. Use of Force and Civilian Complaints I\"m going to go ahead and concede these points, because they don\"t matter. They are also a waste of time, though I could easily shed serious doubt on them. The debate is not whether police body cams are useful, or should be required. The debate is whether police should wear them in every civilian interaction. You can support body cam usage and still be opposed to them recording every interaction. Now I support officers turning them on during traffic stops, or during calls into tense situations, but when dealing with a rape victim or an Informant (for example), the officer should be allowed to turn them off. What reason is there to record an informant telling the officer about some drug dealers on the corner, openly selling? It has the down side of preventing informants from speaking, while carrying absolutely no upside. Responses \"In the example of the 7 y/o boy, special procedures are in place to protect and respect victims. In that situation, it seems highly unlikely that serious questioning would occur directly after the event. The first responders will not be trying to extract information.\" This is just stupid. This is not Law and Order SVU. Often times detectives don\"t even talk to victims. I was personally in a situation, where I killed an escaping robber. His friends actually ran off and let him to die. I was never once talked to by a detective, and was later issued a subpoena for court, never talking to a detective at all. The only people I talked to were first responders. This is how the real world works. Most victims of crimes, only talk to first responders. The witness statement they write up should be enough. They shouldn\"t have to have a camera in their face, during the worst time of their life. Beyond that, you have yet to state a reason why victims or informants should be forced to be recorded. My opponent most likely attempted to link to 3 articles on the same Rialto California police body cam study. What my opponent doesn\"t realize, is that even during these studies, the body cams weren\"t rolling during every civilian encounter. There is no police department in the United States that requires that. According to Police One who reported on the study, and on whose article a link to the study can be found; \"For 12 months, Rialto\"s 54 frontline officers all were assigned randomly to wear or not wear TASER HD Axon Flex video/audio cameras attached to their clothing during each of their 12-hr. shifts. On shifts when they wore cameras, \"the officers were instructed to have them on during every encounter with members of the public, with the exception of incidents involving sexual assaults of minors and dealing with police informants,\" the study team explains.\" https://www.policeone.com... So even the studies my opponent are linking to, don\"t show the results of every police interaction with civilians. No such study has been done, nor will it be done. \"In regard to police officers and discretion; the hierarchy of law enforcement agencies understand the massive role that discretion plays. There is good discretion and bad discretion. The hierarchies need to evaluate LEOs on their use of discretion. Body cameras can be invaluable to preventing bad discretion.\" The whole point of personal discretion that nobody is in the officers shoes and can judge that better than him. If an officer has somebody sitting over his shoulder judging every discretion as either good or bad, and punishing or criticizing him for what is viewed as bad discretion, well that takes away the discretion altogether. Now there are certain laws that are known as \"must arrest\" laws, and officers are required to arrest for those laws or risk termination, but that is not what we are talking about. We\"re talking about the discretion of whether or not a jay walker is ticketed, or whether a kid dropping his candy wrapper on the ground should be fined $1000 for littering. The officer needs the discretion of whether or not to lock up somebody for public intoxication or not. Without this discretion, this country will turn into one where anybody can be arrested or fined for just about anything. Most legal experts believe that the average citizen commits 3 felonies a day. http://www.wsj.com... You certainly can\"t tell an officer he can\"t use his discretion to fine or arrest somebody who broke a law, so now with the second guessing for free passes, you incentivize officers never using their discretion to give somebody a free pass. With the fact that every single one of us breaks the law, every single day. This becomes a very dangerous thing to incentivize. Conclusion My opponent has not disputed my claim that leaks of footage can and do happen, embarrassing people unnecessarily. This is a point in my favor. He is acknowledging that people will be seen in their most private moments, when they should not have been. My opponent brings up some good reasons to have body cams, and I agree with them. However he has failed to show why they should be used in every single civilian encounter. The Rialto study showed that using the cameras in most civilian interactions as opposed to all of them, got the desired results my opponent is asking for. If the Rialto study was so successful at getting the desired results without shoving a camera in a child victim\"s face or without compromising confidential informants, why don\"t we replicate that study in real life?", "qid": 49, "docid": "dfae64e7-2019-04-18T13:40:27Z-00002-000", "score": 10.852100372314453}, {"content": "Title: Law enforcement (in America) should be required to use body cameras during civilian interaction Content: So I guess there were two other studies. The policies of the other departments still don\"t require body cams be turned on for every civilian interaction. For example in Orlando the policy is:\"Officers shall activate the (body-worn camera) whenever there is a potential for dealing with a suspect of a crime,\" states the policy. It adds that, \"(the camera) may be activated whenever the officer feels its use would be beneficial to his/her police duties.\" http://www.clickorlando.com...The San Diego guidelines advise police to not record victims of violent crime, or record peaceful protestors, when they perform their protection duties at those. http://voiceofsandiego.org...We can see that my opponent is advocating for a policy that has likely never been implemented before, and using data from studies that never required police to record all civilian interactions. If my opponent wants to replicate the results of those studies, he should follow the body worn camera guidelines they have. Not create his own unproven guidelines. My opponent should lose because the use of bodycams can be implemented with the same results, and without requiring the use of bodycams in every single civilian interaction.Impact analysisI\"ll keep this short. There isn\"t much to say, because this is such a clear loss for my opponent. Even without me adding anything. My opponent must show that bodycams should record every single civilian interaction. He has not done this. He has showed the usefulness of body cams for sure. Officers should use them for traffic stops, and when responding to service calls, but he has not given a single good reason (or any reason at all) to use them when talking to informants are victims of violent crimes. He needs to give some good reasons as to why bodycams should be used while talking to victims of violent crimes or why informants who may have to admit their own illegal activity to help a cop catch a bigger fish, should be recorded. I haven\"t won because I\"ve presented some sort of compelling evidence that police shouldn\"t be wearing body cams in every interaction with civilians (I have). I\"ve won because my opponent has failed to give a single reason why informants and victims should be recorded.Responses\"In response to the point about victims and informants, my opponent has resorted to insults and anecdotal evidence (which hardly even relates to the point of traumatized victims anyway, as he was not such).\"I have not insulted anybody, but this is an insult. How dare my opponent say an accident where I killed somebody and watched their mangled body squirming in odd and inhuman ways on the ground is not traumatic. How dare my opponent say I was not a victim who has had to live with the knowledge I have killed somebody, because of his own criminal behavior as well as the behavior of his buddies. My opponent should definitely lose some conduct points for this rude behavior. Between the conduct point, arguments and loss of the source point, my opponent cannot be allowed to win this debate.\"I can't see why a victim would be willing to talk with an LEO but be absolutely opposed to being on a body camera.\"This is silly to even say. There is a huge difference between talking with a cop who is acting like a trusted confidant, and talking to somebody with a camera where the footage will be reviewed by whoever puts it in the database, the chief of police, the district attorney, 12 jurors, a judge whoever happens to be in the courtroom that day, and numerous media outlets displaying the footage to millions of people. Without the bodycam a victim is crying on the shoulder of a trusted confidant, with the body cam (AKA evidence for a court case, likely pulled up by the defense team to find tiny contradictions), the victim is talking to a large group of people. The situation with an informant is worse, especially if we are dealing with organized crime. Way to give somebody the death sentence who gave a police officer who used his information to bust a hitman pro. \"This is what my opponent failed to prove. The footage would also be helpful in determining what exactly the victims initial responses were. What if they changed their story later on to help their case?\"This is what a written witness statement is for. The victim can type down a statement about what happened, and still have a shoulder to cry on where she can say whatever she wants (Personal wise not evidence wise) in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. I won't even respond to the discretion point too much. My opponent has completely went off the rails with it.

Please use acceptable grammar, good structure, and easily identifiable sources (I personally prefer URLs). You will only have 24 hours to make each argument. Clarification of terms: American law enforcement - while it may be of benefit to other nations as well, this debate is only concerned with the current wide spread discussion of this new policy in the United States. A law enforcement officer (which is common abbreviated to LEO) is any public sector employee concerned with enforcing laws. This includes city police officers, county sheriff deputies, state/highway patrol officers, border patrol officers, federal marshals, etc. Body camera - any sort of recording device carried by LEOs. While this specifically means a camera mounted on the officers body, it will also include head mounted cameras for the sake of this debate. We will not be concerned with vehicle cameras. Civilian interaction - This includes traffic stops, initial investigation/questioning, crowd control, or any other instance where LEOs respond to a call or intervene in a situation. We will not be including interactions within police facilities, where it is expect that most areas are already under surveillance. Today, there has been a resounding call to reform police practices. This is the result mostly of the various instances of alleged racially provoked shootings at the hands of police. Many cases result in disappointing verdicts, based on a lack of evidence. A prime example was the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO. Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted on the basis of a lack of evidence. Because there was no video evidence, it was difficult for the courts to paint a clear picture of what occurred that night. Even though the shooting was highly suspicious, it would have been near impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Wilson wasn't engaging in legitimate self defense. Due to the accessibility of recording equipment in this day and age (thanks to smart phones), some cases have experienced the opposite effect. When Walter Scott was shot in North Charleston, SC by officer Michael Slager, video evidence led to a swift indictment. The question remains why do we not utilize this new technology in full effect. My contentions Protection of the rights of civilians: Simply put, surveilling the actions officers take with civilians holds them to a high standard of professionalism. If an officer knows they are being recorded, they realize they will also be scrutinized for their actions. Many studies have noted the positive effect cameras have on use-of-force trends (I will list three separate studies). All three studies noted a drastic decrease in instances of use-of-force and complaints filed. . http://www.afscmeinfocenter.org...... . http://www.latimes.com...... . http://www.huffingtonpost.com...... Protection of the rights of officers: Police officers are also concerned about faulty complaints and false assumptions about events. Anyone can file a police report, be it justified or not. Police body cameras would provide clarity to the circumstance surrounding the report. Video evidence does not lie: More evidence is better evidence. One common court room dispute is whether or not a detainee was read their Miranda rights before being questioned. According to the supreme court, any evidence obtained through an interrogation of someone who has not been Mirandized is inadmissible in court. Whenever there is a dispute over whether or not the defendant was read the Miranda warning, it often comes do to the officer's word versus their's. With body cameras, it will be easy to show video evidence of an officer reciting the warning or not. This is just one example.", "qid": 49, "docid": "dfae64e7-2019-04-18T13:40:27Z-00005-000", "score": 10.619000434875488}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: Police officers should be required to wear body cameras Content: Hello once again, I am Forever 23 and I will debate that police body cameras must be implemented. Firstly, I would like to to a rebuttal of my opponents refutations (he has not brought up any point and no new arguments in round 3), restate my assertions and summarize my plan. So first of all, I would like to point out that throughout his refutations, my opponent has been cherry picking my arguments, instead of letting the message pass on as a whole. Firstly, he pointed out that this will be fair only based on the government. However, the people agree with the government. The sane, they agree that murder is immoral, that stealing is immoral and that those who commit such crimes must be punished. The proposition team agrees that fairness is completely subjective. However, in our era, in our nation, there are certain moral values. Value that are followed because they are accepted by the general public. If the public did not accept these values, they would be different. Something subjective stays in place as long as the majority accepts it. Nobody is forcing \"fairness\" onto anyone. The people are accepting and praising the current moral standards. To take the root and heart of their refutation, \" Body cameras will allow one group of people to force their own subjective ideas of \"fairness\" unto other people. That was my point. \". Not one group of people at all! The majority. The population. This is not a single group, but an extremely large portion of the populace. Body cameras fit the current \"fair\" which makes the implementation of them necessary for the US government- a government based on the values THAT THE PEOPLE CREATED, NOT THE GOVERNMENT. Next, he mentions how once again everything is subjective. He expecially attacks the point on how genocide does NOT help the public by mentioning that some people thing that it does. He points out how Hitler thought that it was beneficial. Hitler was a man WITH AN INSANE MIND. It it not at all subjective that murder ir wrong. If you come up to a stranger on the street and ask, \"Why is murder wrong? \", the most common response will be, \"Just because it is wrong\". The majority of the public holds the opinion that both genocide and murder are wrong, making it applicable. And while a subjective opinion is applicable and accepted by the general public, it must be used and applies. Same with body cameras and modern day laws. Most have the subjective opinion that police officers should wear cameras. That makes it applicable. Since it is applicable, it must be implemented. My opponent talked a lot about how many support genocide. Does HE support the extremination of a certain race? I hope not. Which once again supports my case. Now, I would like to point out that my opponent has completely misunderstood all of my arguments. 1. Dwindle the amount of apartheid. This argument is about how objective footage will lower racial discrimination in the justice system. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used. Simple enough, the refutation was irrelevant. This argument was how police officers will use less force. 3. The majority supprots this. Not majority of government people. But of our citizens and even the officers. 4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States. Not personal values. The prop has evidence. If you look at some of the previous speeches, there has been evidence to proove how it result in less discrimination and force used by the officers. Which will then ensure safety. People want safety. Safety is what is wanted by the majority of the public, making this argument applicable. Overall, I would just like to summarize by saying that my opponent failed to understand and address 3 of my claims and my plan. Finally, to restate my plan.

Now then, addressing your points in order: --- \"Now we should make sure they are not betting people because of race\" I'm sorry, I don't entirely understand what you mean by this (I'm assuming that \"betting\" is a typo there). But I'm going to infer that you mean to bring up racial profiling here. I would actually counter that body cameras can serve to reduce racial profiling in that they can be used to show that officers had probable cause in their interactions with subjects (including minorities). It makes it more difficult, if not next to impossible, to fabricate evidence or charges. --- \"what if it slows them down when they are actually taking on a criminal? It could have fatal consequences. \" With respect, I don't see how it would. During a physical altercation it is certainly possible that a camera could be knocked off. It happens in this body camera footage for example: But officer safety takes precedence over protecting equipment so I don't see how wearing a body camera could put officers any more at risk. Keep in mind they already wear a lot of equipment on their person. Anecdotally, I was an LEO who wore a mic (but not a body camera) at all times on shift, I never once felt it posed an officer safety threat and I'm struggling to imagine how it could. I'm open to further argument on this point if you could elaborate. --- \"i do think that all city's could just install cameras in their car and if they break it they could amuse things. \" Again, I'm sorry but I don't understand the last half of this sentence. I will, however, address the first half: Dashcams are already standard in police cars but they have several disadvantages compared to body cameras. For example, they have a static position. Body cameras are dynamic and move along with the officer's POV. This is an instant process and they do not need to be adjusted. By contrast, with a dashcam at best you can orient it to face a specific area you believe will be most relevant to capture footage, but that both requires foresight to do (which is difficult in the heat of a high stress situation) and will not follow the officer and/or subject if they move out of the line of sight where the camera is oriented.", "qid": 49, "docid": "5d6bbcc-2019-04-18T12:50:03Z-00000-000", "score": 10.612899780273438}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: Police officers should be required to wear body cameras Content: \"my opponent has been cherry picking my arguments\" I actually copied and pasted literally all your arguments, which you, very conveniently, listed.

Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras.\" And here is how I copy these points and provide counters: \"So, to re-state my counters to your arguments. 1. Implementing cameras for officers will dwindle the amount of apartheid. That being a good thing is merely your subjective opinion, not a fact. 2. Downtrend the amount of duress used by the police. Again, your own, personal morals. Just because you, subjectively, believe it to be a good thing does not mean it actually is. Moral relativism. 3. Most of the populace, both police officers and civilians buttress the decision to enact body cameras. Which does not mean that it is right thing to do. As I stated earlier, argument on grounds that something is right simply because majority believes so, is illogical (ad populum). What is \"right\" can be decided by each culture, or individual himself.\" Thus, I took into account and replied to ALL points. No cherry picking took place. \"Firstly, he pointed out that this will be fair only based on the government.\" I did not. Here is exact quote. \" The thing is that whether or not government or society approves situation does not prove that situation was indeed fair.\" \"What you are arguing here, is essentially to force your cultures and majorities values unto those who disagree.\" It was acknowledged that government will have majorities support. \"The sane, they agree that murder is immoral, that stealing is immoral and that those who commit such crimes must be punished.\" Ad hominem. The sane agree with me. Implying that those with different moral standards are insane. Text-book ad hominem. \"Nobody is forcing \"fairness\" onto anyone.\" They are, on minority. On those few who disagree with their ideas of fairness. \"Not one group of people at all! The majority. The population. This is not a single group, but an extremely large portion of the populace.\" Which is still a group... thus my point stands. \" It it not at all subjective that murder ir wrong.\" FOR THE RECORD- I DO NOT SUPPORT MURDER. I BELIEVE IT TO BE WRONG. That being said, unlike my opponent, I realize that this belief of mine is merely a personal opinion. It will be pleasure for me to inform my opponent that up until this day, no set of morals have been proven to be objectively correct to any other set of morals. Thus, morals are subjective. deal with it. My opponent believes that his personal, as well as his cultures morals are objectively correct, which is the problem. On a side note, I am not arguing that society can't and shouldn't enforce their subjective understanding on others. Society must exist somehow, which means laws must be enforced. I fully support that. What I explained in first round, was that if one day society and government will come up with unacceptable morals, those who disagree with said morals will have no way to avoid unjust punishment. This is why, in my opinion, we should not give government (and majority) full control. There must be a back door for instance if society turns evil, so that you could escape. \"My opponent talked a lot about how many support genocide. Does HE support the extremination of a certain race? I hope not. Which once again supports my case.\" I do not, but this is my personal opinion. I realize that me NOT supporting genocide is merely my subjective opinion, not objective truth. \"1. Dwindle the amount of apartheid. This argument is about how objective footage will lower racial discrimination in the justice system.\" It will lead to a situation which is classified by majority as \"lower racial discrimination\". Whether or not their classification of what counts as \"lower racial discrimination\" is objectively correct, is unknown. \"2. Downtrend the amount of duress used. Simple enough, the refutation was irrelevant. This argument was how police officers will use less force.\" And while it might be that police officers will use less force, it is only assumed by my opponenet that using less force is a good thing. If person does not agree with this premise, then this argument holds no merit and does not lead to conclusion that police should wear body cameras. 3. The majority supports this. Not majority of government people. But of our citizens and even the officers. I realize that. It was acknowledged by me on several instances. 4. If we do the hard work to figure out how to maximize the accountability of the police and minimize the privacy risk, this is going to be beneficial for the people of the United States.

The wording of which and the lack of mentioning any exceptions to the rule of requiring body cams in civilian interactions, implies that they should be used in all civilian interactions. This is how the resolution is written, and should be interpreted. Privacy Concerns There are some definite privacy concerns with body cams. Police don\"t only deal with suspects of crimes, and traffic infractions on a daily basis. Officers also talk with witnesses and informants. They talk to rape victims. They also are sometimes the first to arrive at car crashes and interact with the victims of horrible tragedies. The main concern is that all the footage would be public property and therefore public can get access to it through the freedom of information act, but even if laws were made to protect the privacy of people, leaks still happen and the civilians still know the film is being made which has an effect on their psychology. You can easily go to youtube and already view dash cam footage of a lot of people in the worst moments of their lives, we don\"t need to make this problem worse. Informants, many of which are in the criminal underworld will be less inclined to provide evidence needed to capture and prosecute dangerous criminals. Scared and shaken witnesses will also be more scared to and less inclined to give information. An officer talking to a 7 year old who just watched his mother raped and murdered, does not need to have a camera in his face bearing witness to and forever immortalizing the greatest tragedy he will ever face. Even when filming the arrest of somebody perhaps a batterer, the officer is often going into a private residence and there is all kinds of private information lying around, and no way should a victim of domestic violence have her private life exposed to whatever prying eye makes a FOA request, or youtubes the video, because some cop thought the interaction was funny enough to upload on the internet. Bureaucracy concerns Just like any other occupation, and especially with government agencies there can be a lot of bureaucracy. There is a lot of concern that having police cams on too much can make the jobs of officers harder, it can also make it harder on good cops. Right now an officer has a lot of discretion. If he sees an old lady in a dangerous neighborhood with an unregistered gun, he can turn a blind eye but with the cameras, he may be forced to prosecute every single tiny infraction. If you think broken windows policing is bad now, just wait until the police can no longer let little things go. The cameras can be used for his bosses to nitpick about every tiny thing he does, from improper uniform, to some off the cuff remarks to fellow officers. Everybody needs to blow off steam on occasion, and especially so in a high stress jobs like policing. Conclusion I know everyone thinks these body cams will be used to keep an out of control government in check, but in reality, just like every other tool. It will be used against citizens. Anyone can watch Tru TV and see \"Top 20 Drunks\" shows, shaming people seen in dash cam videos or videos in a police room, we don\"t need to embarrass random people by allowing these shows more material. We don\"t need to handcuff good cops, by forcing them to lose their discretionary privileges. If unjust laws are made, we\"re somewhat protected by the fact that cops can use their discretion to stop enforcing stupid laws, with body cams you can forget that.

If, for instance, I was a lawyer taking a case against an alleged malpracticing police officer, I could easily receive footage. http://www.foia.gov... In terms of informants and traumatized victims, they would not have to worry about this information becoming public for the reasons mentioned above. The police should be instructed to inform the public of the exemptions of the FOIA. In the example of the 7 y/o boy, special procedures are in place to protect and respect victims. In that situation, it seems highly unlikely that serious questioning would occur directly after the event. The first responders will not be trying to extract information. At the end of the day, this is a problem not with body cameras but a with policy. In regard to police officers and discretion; the hierarchy of law enforcement agencies understand the massive role that discretion plays. There is good discretion and bad discretion. The hierarchies need to evaluate LEOs on their use of discretion. Body cameras can be invaluable to preventing bad discretion. Your specific example displays a poor use of discretion. The old women has an illegal firearm, when she could have easily registered it. She could have an insidious motive for having motive for having an unregistered firearm. Should that weapon be used in a crime, it will be difficult if not impossible to trace. With the presence of a body camera, his supervisor could inform the officer of his mistake and make a positive change.", "qid": 49, "docid": "dfae64e7-2019-04-18T13:40:27Z-00003-000", "score": 10.420299530029297}, {"content": "Title: Police Officers should wear Body Cameras while on duty at all times.

Body cameras cannot lie, but however, they degrade civic values, which adds on to the morality of my cameras, which are wrong. Camera speed differs from the speed of life, and your body may block the view of the cameras. 1 camera might not be enough. If someone robs a store, they won't just look at 1 camera. They will use multiple cameras. 1 camera, at one point of view, cannot replace 1 through investigation. Just because we saw a masked person kill another person, do we know who the masked person is? Of course not. We still have to do more analysis for the blood and fingerprints. \"4. Guessing game? Once again, the reason the cameras are there is so that the judge does not have to play the guessing game.\" The reason why these people have to play the guessing game is due to the fact that they have only 1 point of view. The officer has to then guess the conditions, and then assess a 1 sided pov, unlike the many witnesses with many pov. \"5. Witnesses can take the oath and still lie, what if they were threatened by the criminal themselves?\" The Witnesses have to tell the truth no matter what. The courts will protect them. I have shown all the bad things about the body cameras and added in my values, which my opponent has failed to provide. The cost is just to expensive, and cameras can't replace an entire investigation.

By default, since I have a value and value criterion and she has not stated hers since, mine are the standing values. \"You're also wrong about the cameras having to be in 3D. First of all, you invalidate your own argument about the cameras costing too much. Equipping the officers with 3D cameras would cost even more! Also, the investigation does not need 3D cameras, a regular video is just fine. Most investigations aren't lucky enough to get a video at all! 2D video can still help everyone make a fair judgement.\" 1. I never said that all cameras needed to be in 3D. I only said that cameras only had a 2D perspective. I never implied that we needed 3D, which implies the STRAW MAN! 2. Ok. Let's look at a police officer employment. Let's look at my local city. If a local city has, let's say, 500 police officers, and you are saying that they should all have body cameras, then look at the cost provided. 500*350=$175000 dollars! This is a lot of money! Money does not grow on trees, as this will increase debt in the country and decrease spending in many needed areas. 3. 2D movies cannot make a fair judgement. Cameras cannot perceive the 3rd dimension that is perceived by the human eye-which is distance. Cameras can't record danger cues because you can usually tell when you touch a subject whether he/she will have an objection, but cameras lack the sensory cue, which makes it lacking the important thing:the danger cue. 4. Cameras will always make us play the guessing game, and the speed is very difference. Cameras record at MUCH higher speed, and the camera will make us play the coulda-shoulda game, because it is not what someone perceived. It is a nonliving thing, and we can scrutinize it for detail, but that is only 1 sided-by the officer. Witnesses are far many more and they will be multi sided. \"By the way, everyone lies. By saying that witnesses do not lie, you are saying that people don't lie.\" 1. I never said that people don't lie. 2. It states in the witness oath, \"I swear that the evidence that I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God. Affirmation: I solemnly affirm that the evidence that I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" This is the basis I am stating. Many witnesses can be provided, so we can get multiple things from the whole truth. How can they lie if they swear before the oath? My opponent thinks I am strawmanning. However, I am not. The fact that you did not break down my 1st and 2nd contentions make the fact that they are valid, and that you don't have any say to it. Secondly, my opponent did not state her value. This is what I stated. I never said her case had no value whatsoever. Thirdly, everything she said was copied directly and in quoted. Then, I broke down on the thoughts I had to counter. With this, she did not answer my basic status quo of my argument:the morality of cameras. I have proven with many reasons and examples why my contentions stand. I have a direct value of morality, which has been PROVEN with the 3 contentions. In fact, she is strawmanning with many examples. (ie.with her saying that the cameras have to be 3D). I never said that. I said that cameras can only see in 2D, and witnesses are more reliable because they see it in 3D. Then, she stated I said that people don't lie. I never stated that or implied that. I only implied that in the jury oath, when the people are stating their evidence, they can't lie.

It is you who completely missed my point, which was that concept of \"fairness\" is subjective, meaning different people can have different understanding of \"fair\". Body cameras will allow one group of people to force their own subjective ideas of \"fairness\" unto other people. That was my point. \"The main difference is that the genocide was NOT made to HELP the public.\" Which is, again, your subjective opinion. Each person can have his own subjective opinion regarding what helps public. Just because you believe that genocide does not help public, does not mean that Hitler or average Nazi had same belief.

High blood pressure, muscle tension, sweating, and increase in heart rate are signs of stress and aggression. High levels of stress and aggression lead to crime and societal and personal dysfunction. By reducing and eliminating stress and aggression, we can have a functioning society once again. Police brutality is another problem that we can solve. An officer's judgment is very important, but we cannot allow the officer's judgment to be clouded by personal bias in deciding on whether to use non-lethal and lethal force to take down a criminal. What we can do is develop mandatory wristbands to measure a person's heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and electromyogram. These levels can be distilled into an index from 0 to 600, where 0 is stress-free, 100 and above is dangerous and prone to violence, and 300 and above is an immediate threat to themselves and others. We can also calculate the historical volatility of the index, and use that to determine someone's coping skills. Those with a low index volatility and low index should be the only ones allowed to be law enforcement, and they will be automatically removed if their levels become high, because that indicates instability. We can have a system monitor every region for the average stress index of the population, and if that level spikes, dispatch officers to investigate. The NSA should be responsible for all policing and law enforcement, due to their superior investigative and surveillance capabilities. The officers should be outfitted with special guns, and only these special guns, that can read the target's stress index levels, and if the level is below 100 , the safety cannot be released, if the level is at or above 100, the gun fires tranquilizer dart, and if the level is 300 or above, it fires lethal slugs. And these guns can only be used by the officers they're registered to. The job of the police will be to investigate and report on situations of stress indexes above 100, and to try to get the target's stress index down or take them into custody if they are actively committing a crime. The victims will also be taken into custody so they can receive help. When a target is taken into custody, they are to get a full physical, neurological, and psychiatric examination by a physician, and be placed into mandatory psychoanalysis by a certified psychiatrist or psychologist once their stress index goes down, which is when they can be released with whatever restitution a magistrate orders, plus a punishment ranging from a income-proportional fine, to house arrest, to physician-supervised flogging, plus a course of haloperidol and lorazepam. If they re-offend again, they will be committed to a hospital for intensive treatment. Psychological stress index monitors and cameras should be ubiquitous, and should compliment people who have low stress indexes and index volatility, and encourage those with high stress indexes and volatility to get help.

A camera can not provide sole truth for the event because we still need a fair, through investigation. A recording shows 2-D, which only shows around. What we do no know is what really happened because we still need second guessing, and it will take much longer. It also gives a lot of the playing of the should've-couldn't game and a lot of guessing, instead of real testimonies.\" As seen, we will have to play a lot of guessing games, as it can only see 2D. We cannot see the background or the situation the person was in and why they reacted that way. Witnesses are emotional, unlike cameras, and can see 3-D, which can then see more things, and prevent people from playing the guessing game. Also, a camera cannot always replace a full investigation, which my opponent refused to answer. Let's look at her next contention:\"it helps to keep innocent people out of jail. No more people will be wrongfully jailed, because direct evidence does not lie.\" Interesting. Witnesses do not lie, because they will have to swear they will tell the truth before their testimony.

Yes, that's right; the nice, slim, pretty one with one with the outsize breasts. Well, how does she know you find her attractive? She won't unless you let her know.\" I disagree for we communicate and interact with others mostly by body language/action than actually speaking. Therefore a girl can tell if a male likes her through his body language/actions that can be appropriate which excludes any actions that are viewed as sexual harassment. My opponent also mentioned how the the primary responsibility of a public company is to maximise profits for its shareholders and having to police sexual harassment takes money away from the shareholders. Now, yes I agree the primary responsibility of a public company is to maximise profits for its shareholders, but the action of not policing sexual harassment could also and mostly likely would lead to affecting the shareholders profits too. How? Ok you are an employer of a company and you don't police sexual harassment and therefore it is solely in the hands of your employees. Sexual harassment starts to become an issue in that a good portion of your employees are constantly taking off work to meet with their lawyers and/or you are constantly hiring and firing. These actions as well as the action of policing sexual harassment in the workplace affect the shareholders and their profits. Another statement my opponent mentioned was the law would apply to all companies not having to police sexual harassment and therefore the reputation wouldn't be a concern. Just because something is a law (or not a law) it can still have an impact on the reputation of the company. For example there is no law that says big corporations such as Merck, Glaxosmithkline, Microsoft,Google, etc have to offer its employees services such as having national food chains on site, day care services on site for the employees young children, on site bank(s), and other services. Offering these services keeps the employee happy and in return the employee is more likely to increase his/her work productivity leading to the increase profits for its shareholders. So these factors combined together would affect reputation of the company as far as those who are looking into being an employee and/or investor for that company. So why wouldn't companies have the same attitude and go above and beyond of what is expected of them in relation to sexual harassment, no matter if there is a law stating that employers don't have to police sexual harassment? The last thing I would like to comment on is that my opponent had ask if anyone would want to work in such an Orwellian environment? I hate to say this but we live and I repeat we live in an Orwellian world to a degree. Yes, everyone to a point is under surveillance. Just look at things like Face book where anyone can view what you post (if you allow it) and some have gotten in trouble from their employer for what has been posted on their face book page, despite the fact that the postings occurs while off the job or its something that was part of that person's past. Everything we do, for we have smartphones, tablets, credit and debit cards, and the list grows that tracks our movements and you are worry about being under the microscope while at work? Hell, cameras are becoming smart that not only do they recognized us by our facial features, but there are companies trying to develop or maybe they have already where cameras talk to each other and they can predict where you will likely go next when walking in the streets of a city.

Introduction usually leads to lower vehicle speeds and a better accident record. Speed cameras also act as a deterrent to dangerous driving and have successfully contributed to lowering average vehicle speeds on the UK roads hence lowering the accident risk. Road Casualties Great Britain 2006, found that injudicious action, which includes going too fast for conditions, following too close and exceeding the speed limit, accounts for 34% of fatal cameras highlighting that problems still exist with speed management. The 5% figure should be treated with caution as on average the police recorded two factors for each crash. With regards to speed limits, the DfT has always emphasised that they are legal guide that should be adhered to but that driver judgement should also be utilised as well. Speed cameras successfully lower vehicle speeds and have drawn attention to the need to drive at appropriate speeds within the designated speed limit. Camera policing of speed limits can only be introduced after all else has failed. In some cases, on roads identified by projects such as the European Road Assessment Programme (EuroRAP) there is evidence that the collisions are not speed related and therefore new cameras would not be installed and other measures used. Cameras are only installed at sites where at least 20% of drivers exceed the speed limit and there have been four deaths or serious injuries on a given 1km stretch of road within three years. Research (Stradling et al, 2003) has also shown that drivers stopped by police for speeding or who had been flashed by a speed camera had double the incidence of recent crash involvement suggesting that speed cameras have been successful in targeting dangerous drivers. http://www.pacts.org.uk", "qid": 49, "docid": "2ecd255b-2019-04-19T12:45:25Z-00002-000", "score": 8.638699531555176}, {"content": "Title: There should not be a mandatory seatbelt law Content: I want to acknowledge my worthy opponent. I admire his formal debating skills and I thank him for his politeness. P1: A person is free to do what they wish so long as they don't infringe upon another is how I am understanding my opponent's rebuttal, and I do agree with this concept. However, my opponent has not proven or shown that anyone is being infringed upon. In his example of a student 'wising off' to his teacher there was a victim, someone was wronged, someone had their rights infringed upon. In the case of not wearing a seat belt no one else is harmed or infringed upon. I do agree for instance that the government should have a role in ensuring that a vehicle has working brakes, to protect the safety of others, but where there is no victim to protect, such as in the case of mandatory seat belt laws, I believe the role of the government to be to preserve rights and liberties, and to stand up to it's ideal of protecting life, liberty (emphasis added), and the pursuit of happiness. As a final example: There are no laws against overeating, which significantly contributes to a large number of health related preventable deaths, but rather, it is given to the individuals to decide what they will or won't do. I will close on this point by reiterating the fact also that anyone who desires to wear a seat belt is free to do so and would not be affected at all by allowing other people the right to exercise their freedoms as well, as the saying goes, live and let live. P2: My opponent claims that it doesn't make sense that the government would need to resort to this tactic to raise revenues, but rather could simply raise taxes. While I agree that on the surface it may actually appear that way, that a government can simply levy taxes upon a population and there is nothing that the said population can or will do about it. That is nice to think in an ideal sense, but in reality it is not so easy for a government to raise taxes. Politicians and leaders who attempt to raise taxes sometimes find out the hard way that the people do not like being excessively taxed, and they actively resist efforts of the government to do so. As an example of this I will use Gray Davis, former Governor of California, who attempted to raise taxes on car registration and was subsequently removed from office by a recall election, in the which the current Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, came to power[1]. Greed does make sense to a lot of people unfortunately. One example I will use is the state of Maryland: \"Some states, such as Maryland, are so eager that they've equipped their officers with night vision goggles, similar to those used by our servicemen in Iraq. Maryland state troopers bagged 44 drivers traveling unbuckled under the cover of darkness.\"[2]. Another example, which is common knowledge to most people, would be the police 'quotas'. By having police 'quotas' the police are using their powers not to protect the people, but to extract revenue. A problem occurs however when the people start seeing the police not as protectors, but as oppressors, if this happens then serious consequences can result. According to the social contract by John Locke the government can only maintain power by having the consent of the governed.[3] I have saved the most insidious example for last. My final example of the seat belt law being a revenue generator is the issue of federal highway funding. In order to qualify for federal highway funds the states are effectively blackmailed into compliance. To put it in simple terms, if a state refuses to have a mandatory seat belt law then they will lose their highway funding. This topic segues well into my next point so I will elaborate further there. P3: My opponent seems to imply that the mandatory helmet laws are good, and that mandatory helmet laws should simply be added on to mandatory seat belt laws. I would like to illustrate what really is going on, and as I stated above it is directly linked with the federal funding issue. I will start by stating the fact that some states have a mandatory seat belt law, but not a mandatory helmet law. Two states are Arizona and Idaho. I would like to examine the logic and thought process that those states have adopted. Why do those states not have a mandatory helmet law? I would say the logical answer is that they do not desire to have either law, but they have been coerced into adopting the mandatory seat belt law in order to secure their funding. The mandatory helmet law was not required and so they didn't impose that. To me, and hopefully all who will read this, that is a clear signal that they know they do not have the cause of righteousness on their side. They are willing to take away liberties and individual freedoms only when they are forced into doing so by economic blackmail, and given the choice they would rather not have that law. As a further proof, a paltry fine for breaking that law was instituted at first, somewhere around a five dollar fine was all that was assessed, I will concede that now however, as the state realizes they can get more money from it, it is being exploited and the amounts of the fines have increased. In summary the state decided to preserve the freedoms of the motorcyclists, as long as their funding (and jobs) were not at risk, so I am implying what you stated, but in reverse. Since they find freedom to be right, in the case of not requiring helmets, they also should find the same with regards to seat belts, and they would, if it wasn't for the blackmail pertaining to the federal highway funds. P4: My opponent's main point appears to be that Seat belted vehicle occupants have about HALF the chance of dying in a car crash as non-belted vehicle occupants. It is simply a fact that many accidents a person could be involved in would be safer for them if they were not wearing a seat belt. The most common accident site is at intersections. The type of accident most common at intersections is a \"T-bone\". Side Impacts: In the 11-17-90 Status Report, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is quoted as saying: Even in low-severity side impacts, serious occupant injuries may occur, especially to drivers on the struck side of the vehicle. The Plymouth (shown above) was struck on the side at a relatively low speed but the driver, who was using a lap-shoulder belt, suffered multiple rib fractures and other injuries. In severe side impacts, even worse injuries often occur. The passenger in the Chevrolet (shown above) was trapped in the car after this crash and subsequently was hospitalized for seven days with injuries. It's because of the seriousness of injuries that occur in such crashes that NHTSA plans to add side impact tests to NCAP[4]. Two professors at the University of Winnipeg, Canada, completed a three year study based on 2,715 drivers from 1982-88 who were injured and matched up with hospital records. According to the study, seat belt use result in more injuries to specific parts of the body, namely: 2.9% more to spine; 2.8% more to chest and pelvis; and 2.3% more to the head[4]. This brings me to a ludicris example, but one that is obvious and needs to be stated. If a person is involved in an accident and they survive the crash. But they only survived the crash because they were not wearing a seatbelt, then they must, by law, be cited for not wearing the safety device, or rather it should be said \"so called safety device\". This is not logical, I don't know what more that I can say than that. My contention is that laws should always be made for the better. Which brings me back to my original idea, that there should not be a mandatory seat belt law. 1.http://en.wikipedia.org... 2.Click it or ticket to socialism, Walter E.

My opponent seems to be confusing a Shakespearean play set in Venice (and Shakespeare himself residing in England, without any Irish blood to his name[1]) made primarily to line Shakespeare's pockets with money and to entertain an audience in return as to be an accurate representation of Irish heritage and all the it encompasses. Need I say more on that matter?Her logic that police can focus on worse crimes could potentially be countered if I showed her severe examples of human trafficking and what really goes on in brothels and the tactics that pimps use to keep prostitutes hooked on the career and dependent on the line of work but if I did this she'd simply use the fairly valid counter of 'such bad things wouldn't happen if it was legalised'. Therefore, I will use her own logic against her instead of presenting my own. According to her, if there is a 'worse' crime in existence then no lesser crime should be a concern of the police. She mentioned both rape and theft as examples of crimes that are worse than prostitution so I will say back to her than by her own logic whichever of those two crimes she considers less severe than the other should also be legalised by this logic. In essence all crimes should be legalised as long as there's another crime potentially worse for the police to focus on, according to my opponent's logic. This would make both rape and theft, which she considers to be horrific crimes, to end up being legalised for a worse crime was ever a concern of the police. I hope you can see the fallacy of such an argument and that no matter how many worse crimes there are for the police to focus on, a crime is a crime and what's worse to one person is perhaps less worse to another.The final point that Pro makes is that the body of a human being is simply a resource to be exploited for money at will. Their line of work is no morally different to models, says Pro. This is fairly fascinating news to me, it's also entirely untrue. A prostitute is owned by a pimp, this pimp feeds them, clothes them, gives them access to drinking water, decides when they wake up, when they sleep, when they sh*t and even when they breathe (yes I'm referring to exactly what you are thinking of). A model is not essentially owned by anyone and could, potentially, quit their job at any time they so wished (unless, of course, on a contract). They are completely consenting to their job and their job is just a job they do it and go. One does not simply leave a brothel, they are trapped there for good. Additionally, modelling does not carry the risk of sexually transmitted diseases or infections and also doesn't involve risk of pregnancy. A model can sue any single colleague or camera person for sexual harassment if they so wish and severe consequences come on anyone who assumes that to be a model is to submit to degradation or humiliation of any kind outside of professional, constructive criticism of how they present their body (not even the body itself). On the other hand, if a prostitute feels sexually harassed by colleagues and people on the street who will not even hire her (or him) then he/she has literally zero ways to prosecute the individual, even if prostitution was legal, it would just be deemed as a valid humiliation since it's culturally seen as the job one does when they submit to being degraded.Sources:[1] Shakespeare's Ancestry.

I am not saying that we should all be able to do whatever we want, unless it infringes on someone else's freedom. We should be, and are, however, able to do whatever we want that people with power do not want to stop us from doing. If those we have put into power decide that certain drugs, for instance, are harmful to society if people take them, then those in power - who are charged with protecting society at large - are justified in doing what they can to stop people from doing these drugs. This situation is the same for seatbelts: people not wearing seatbelts harms society at large, by causing, on average, twice as many deaths as wearing seatbelts (See point 4). Since legislative bodies are charged with making laws to ensure the prosperity and welfare of our society, they are quite justified in supporting mandatory seatbelt laws, since these laws increase the number of seatbelt-wearers and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary deaths. My opponent says that he is in favor of mandatory car inspections, [requiring that the brakes are in good working condition, etc], since these laws protect the safety of others. First, note that lawmakers are supposed to protect all citizens, not just 'others.' Second, note that there are always 'victims' when someone dies. If I die in a car crash because I wasn't wearing a seatbelt, I'm not the only person affected by that. It sends a ripple throughtout the chunk of society I inhabit - my friends and family are left mourning, my employer is shorthanded, etc. If my opponent needs for there to be a 'victim' other than oneself to accept seatbelt laws, he can simply consider the multitude of people besides himself who would be negatively affected by his needless death. === 2 - My opponent continues to argue that seatbelt laws are simply in place as an additional source of revenue. This is nonsense - I have and will continue to show in other points that there are other reasons. Additional revenue is but one of the many reasons the government has for supporting such laws. Perhaps I was mistaken in saying that raising taxes would be so easy, and I'm fine with accepting error on that point. Next, my opponent brings up that some places like Maryland overdo it - wasting their money on night vision goggles and their time on ticketing '44 drivers' for driving unbuckled at night. First, the waste of money seems to go against my opponent's point here, that the government is simply using this as a way to get more money. Second, enforcing a law that is beneficial to society is not something that should only be done during the day. And lastly, my opponent fails to mention the timeframe during which 44 drivers were given tickets for driving with no seatbelt. But it doesn't matter; if Maryland was overzealous, that is a problem with Maryland's zealotry, NOT a problem with mandatory seat belt laws. Mandatory seat belt laws can be enforced too little or too often, as it is with every crime. Mandatory seatbelt laws should continue to exist, and if they are enforced in certain places too often or too little, then the level of enforcement should be raised or lowered accordingly. My opponent also brings up police quotas. These sometimes may cause tickets that really weren't worth given out, no matter what the laws are in question. Seat belt laws don't cause police quotas - police uotas are a problem that exists separately from seatbelt laws. If police quotas really are bad, as my opponent suggests, then they should be abandoned. My opponent quotes John Locke as saying that a government cannot be successful without the consent of the people. It has just that - and in cases where it doesn't seat belt laws are not the issue. The overwhelming majority of people are fine with seatbelt laws - this is why you've probably never seen a protest against them. My opponent also brings up the 'insidious' example of highway funding. The federal government, in wanting to protect its citizens, decides that states will only get federal highway funding if certain safety regulations are followed - one of these regulations is the mandatory seat belt law. The fact that such seatbelt laws are necessary for our states to get highway funding stands out as yet another reason why each state SHOULD have mandatory seatbelt laws. === 3. My opponent suggests that the states that have seatbelt laws but no helmet laws do not really want either law, they have simply been coerced into the seatbelt law by federal funding. This is simply not true - motorcycle helmet laws are one of many safety regulations that must be followed to obtain federal funding. \"In 1967, the federal government began requiring states to enact motorcycle helmet laws in order to be eligible for certain federal safety programs and highway construction funds.\" Among these states are Idaho and Arizona, according to my opponent. http://itd.idaho.gov... That is an Idaho government page, the authority on Idaho's position about these laws. There are some interesting facts there - here is one of them: \"In 2007, the 22% of Idahoans that did not buckle up accounted for 65% of the people killed in traffic crashes. (ITD 2007 Crash Report and 2007 Observational Seat Belt Survey)\" Further, let's look a little further down the page: \"Idaho is ineligible for federal seat belt grant funds...\" Looks like funding ISN'T their reason for seat belt laws after all! And here's some more interesting information on the page: In 2007, the economic impact to Idahoans for motorists killed or injured due to lack of seat belt use was $861 million. (ITD 2007 Crash Report) I can assure you, the ones who paid that $861 million were not the victims of the accidents - they were those left behind - those affected by the recklessness of these drivers. And from Arizona's government website http://www.azdps.gov...: \"Every hour someone dies in America simply because they didn't buckle up. Failure to buckle up contributes to more fatalities than any other single traffic safety-related behavior. Despite terrible traffic problems such as aggressive driving, increasing seat belt use is still the single most effective thing we can do to save lives and reduce injuries on America's roadways.\" Note, too, that this might be why seat belt laws exist there but helmet laws do not. Relatively few people ride motorcycles, and helmets don't save lives as effectively as seatbelts. In fact, according to some studies they don't have a statistically significant effect at all [1]. By this logic, it is obvious why seat belt laws would exist in all states, where motorcycle helmet laws do not exist everywhere. === 4 - My opponent once again states that sometimes, seatbelts can actually be harmful. This is true, but much more often, seatbelts are good. It is impossible to know whether you will get in an accident where a seatbelt will help you, do nothing, or harm you. People do not 'plan' on getting in certain types of accidents. To be better prepared for the majority of accidents, people should wear seatblets. The proof is in the pudding - seatbelt-wearers are, on average, half as likely to die in an accident. Getting more people to wear seatbelts therefore saves lives, and reduces the negative economic and social impact of car crashes. My opponent points out a study where seatbelts were found to lead to slightly (2-3%) higher likelihood of certain types of injury. When we compare the measly 3% increase in likelihood of certain types of injury with the 50% reduction in likelihood of death, we find that seatbelts are still worth it overall. And now, to the much anticipated final round.

Your entire case built against smart boards rests on your own personal assertions and nothing more. You have failed to find sources showing that schools are using them for ridiculous reasons such as for spanish classes or watching movies. You have failed to find sources showing that they aren't effective learning devices. Therefore your case against smartboards has crumbled. You have also made little attempt to mask the fact that you are asking schools to spend thousands of dollars to buy expensive and unnecessary security cameras. Security (Armed situations)I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but over 1 million americans have a job in the U. S. armed forces. These employees have assault rifles, fighter jets, tanks, etc all at their place of work. How many of them have gone on homicidal rampages? You can probably only name the Fort Hood Shooting. The fact of the matter is that millions of Americans own guns, are responsible gun owners, and don't start going Rambo on children when they get mad. For this fact you have no reason to stand on the argument that you fear a teacher is going to go on a rampage. I want gun owning teachers to bring their firearms to school for defending the children if need be. Just as I want military personel to use their firearms for defense if need be. To make the argument that we should disarm responsible gun owning teachers who have the purpose of defending their students is as ridiculous as making the argument we should disarm the military who have the purpose of defending U. S. soild as well as U. S. interests abroad. Should we also disarm police officers as well? Think about, police officers carrying guns walk around in public with a pistol in their holster easy for anyone to grab. Just as teachers walk around campus carrying guns in public. Your argument is just as ludicrous. For your reasons against arming teachers, a notion that has become a reality in many U. S. and Israeli schools already, we should disarm the U. S. military as well as Law enforcement. I very clearly stated that teachers who have guns at home should be allowed to bring them. People don't go out buying revolvers to keep where they live if they don't know how to use them. \"In conclusion, my opponent thinks guns can solve all our problems. \"Oh I'm sorry, I must have missed were you explained how security cameras, PHYSICALLY STOPPED GUN WIELDING MANIACS! !! This is a scenario you brought up. You specifically said that we need security cameras to prevent school shootings like Virginia Tech. You make the claim that we need cameras to prevent school shootings, and yet you give no explanation how they will actually stop a school shooting. You know how school shootings end? They end when either the police or the the shooter themself, blows out the brains of the shooter. Either way, guns end school school shootings, not cameras. Security (misc)I was against the idea of spending money hiring security personel, but janitors have the job of keeping school grounds sanitary and administrative personel have the job of running schools. You have yet to prove that they have time to watch security cameras all day while they are already doing the jobs they are paid to do. Your claim that \"The people at the front office could watch the cameras because they're not doing anything half the time! \", is without basis and again, merely assertion. BullyingI'm not asking for children to fight with others that are twice as large. I'm asking them to report misconduct and misbehavior from fellow classmates to administrative personel. It would save schools thousands of dollars and possibly the jobs of other school employees. That is not an unreasonable request. I never said they were wimps, you are putting words in my mouth, I said that it did not make sense that taxpayers should be forced to spend thousands of dollars on cameras when kids being bullied aren't willing to report the bullying. Privacy\"Who said they have to be put in bathrooms\"Anyone with common sence knows that when people conduct illegal activity, they conduct it in privacy. Students don't sell drugs in the principles office, not out on the quad during passing period, etc. Students use and sell drugs in bathrooms were it is private. In order to catch a decent amount of illegal activity, cameras need to be placed in bathrooms, which is a violation of personal privacy. Therefore cameras cannot catch illegal activity. ConclusionMy opponents claims regarding the futility of Smartboards are mere assertions. My opponents claims regarding the laziness of school employees are mere assertionsMy opponent says that cameras won't be placed in school bathrooms, the areas were nearly all illegal activity on school occurs. My opponent thinks it is reasonable to have the taxpayer shell out millions nation wide for security cameras to stop bullying, when children should be reporting it themselves to the school. My opponent has not given any explaination as to how security cameras will stop school shootings while she opposes the presence of firearms on campus. Which, by the way, is becoming a method of preventing school shootings in my already stateded sources. All in all my opponent has not shown that security cameras can catch illegal activity when she doesn't want them planted in the areas where illegal activy occurs, that security camears do a damn thing to prevent school shootings other than simply record the massacre, that security cameras are not a violation of personal privacy and that security camera's are worth the cost when they don't prevent illegal activity and when you need to hire additional personel to monitor them.", "qid": 49, "docid": "f4978a00-2019-04-18T18:48:17Z-00000-000", "score": 8.1427001953125}, {"content": "Title: Crime cameras help reduce frequency of community patrols.

As usual, the night was quiet and boring. There was a point when I really appreciated the beautiful scenery and wildlife surrounding the area, but it had worn on me. The animals here were very brazen, and harmless. There were plenty of antelope, skunks, coyotes, and rabbits that would frequently appear around the huge building. Most of the animals didn\u2019t seem to fear humanity. They saw us security guards almost every day, and I guess had figured out that we were harmless. Tonight, however, there were no animals. Perhaps it was too cold. I got a call in on the my radio ear piece. \u201cWhiskey 3, Control.\u201d \u201cWhiskey 3.\u201d I responded. \u201cCan you 10-19?\u201d Chris asked through the radio. 10-19 was code for \u2018return to base\u2019. \u201c10-4\u201d I replied. \u2018Affirmative\u2019. I quickened my lazy walk, and hurried back to the building entrance through the deep snow. We were probably going to receive some training. 10 minutes later, I arrived at the security entry point of the massive building. There were 3 different secure points of entry to get in the building. For vehicles, a massive K-4 drop arm blocked the path and was only raised to those with proper access. Past that, a titanium security entry turnstile blocked the path to the walkway. And finally, steel doors to the lobby \u2018man-trap\u2019 were needed in order to progress into the building. As I walked through the man-trap, I tossed my badge into the control exchange point to receive what was called my \u201cX-badge\u201d from Phillip who was posted at the point. The x-Badge would grant me access to the entire interior of the building. \u201cHow\u2019s it going Phil?\u201d I said, pretending as if I actually cared. \u201cAlright.\u201d He responded. He swapped my badge out, handed me my keys, and I departed for the security Suite. The other officers, Chris, Phillip, Barry, Russel, and Liz, were already there waiting for Christian\u2019s Brief. I pretended to be interested as he gave us winter safety tips. Finally he ended his speech, and I relieved Phillip from point. I spent the next hour watching security cameras and trying to fight of sleep. I started getting annoyed after Chris called Whiskey 3 in over the radio three times, yet still wasn\u2019t getting a response. Barry had probably accidentally switched to the facility channel. I had done it once before. He should be mindful though of when he should call in cleared zones. I yawned, and stared at the still cameras. Suddenly something flickered across one of the exterior PTZ cameras. I focused too late, and didn\u2019t get a glimpse of what it was before it disappeared off the camera. It was probably just a fox. 20 minutes went by, and Chris continued trying to call in Barry with no answer. I sent Chris a message via our security chat. \u2018You should try to find him with the PTZ camera.\u2019 \u2018Already on it.\u2019 He replied. I monitored the cameras, as he scanned the outside of the building. Finally we located Barry. He was sitting awkwardly against one of the generators outside. He was motionless. \u2018I think he fell asleep on the job haha\u2019 I messaged Chris. There was a pause, than he messaged back. \u2018Okay, at rotation can you go wake him up please?\u2019 He asked. I sighed. \u2018Sure\u2026\u2019 Not five minutes later, Liz came and relieved me from point. I begrudgingly put my coat back on, exchanged badges, and exited the building. It took me 15 minutes to arrive at the generator yard. I was 20 feet away from Barry\u2019s sleeping body. \u201cBarry, wake up!\u201d I shouted at him. There was no response, though. \u201cCome on Barry, no sleeping on the Job. You\u2019ll be lucky if you don\u2019t get fired from this. Wake up mate!\u201d He remained motionless. Dumb@ss. Finally I approached him. I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him. As my hand touched his shoulder, he rolled over limply revealing a bloody mess and a gaping hole in his stomach. His intestines were spilling out everywhere. I yelled, startled, and backed away shocked. Then I began to vomit. Finally I finished, and wiped my mouth on the sleeve of my coat. I was filled with apprehension. I raised my flashlight and scanned the area. I didn\u2019t own a weapon; we were un-armed security guards. I started running back towards the building. As I ran, I called in \u201cControl, Whiskey 3!\u201d They replied quickly hearing the urgency in my voice. \u201cGo for Control.\u201d \u201cWe have a man down in Zone 33! Call police immediately!\u201d The hairs on the back of my neck were raised, and I would have been shaking with fear if not for the adrenaline. I had never seen a dead person before, let alone a co-worker and friend. I was able to return to the building without incident. I met with Chris in the control room, where he was already on the phone with the police. Suddenly, the line went dead. \u201cHello\u2026? Hello!\u201d Chris yelled into the phone. It was pointless, the line went out. \u201cSh1t!\u201d I cursed. Everyone\u2019s cell phone had no service due to the weather conditions. Suddenly a radio broadcast came in, reading \u2018Barry\u2019 on it. Nothing but the buzz of static came through for a minute. Finally a cold raspy voice came through. \u201cYou have 4 hours to let me in the building. If you refuse, I will kill all of you.\u201d The transmission ended. \u201cwhat the heck is going on here!?\u201d I asked. But nobody was listening to me.

My opponent has interpreted my definition of freedom as 'Might makes right. ' This is a little bit inaccurate - I am simply stating that the freedoms a person has are related to their ability to do things. It doesn't necessarily make right. What I mean by this is that freedom is not inherently good or bad. My opponent's first point was that these laws take away freedom - I am simply saying \"So what? That does not have any implications on its own. \" Let me give an example that might be more easy to see with. Bob is a would-be murderer. He approaches a friend of his, venting his frustration: Bob: Bah! Anti-murder laws should not exist. Friend: Why's that? Bob: Because they take away my freedom to kill people. Do you see what Bob has just done? He is begging the question. These laws are supposed to take away freedom. For Bob's argument to be valid, he would first have to independently show that people should actually have the freedom to murder one another. You see, it is the same with this debate we are having now. With the other three points, we will find that either people should have the right to not wear a seatbelt without violating the law, or we will find that people should not have the freedom to not wear a seatbelt without violating the law. I believe I have sufficiently shown that this point has no significance of its own - whoever wins the rest of the debate wins this point. We can see another example of this begging the question in my opponent's third round: \"What it comes down to is if the person stood up for what was right and died, or did the person die because they submitted to an unjust law? \" This is assuming right away that the law is unjust, but that is pretty much exactly what we are debating. My opponent also brings up a quote I failed to address in a previous round: \"A person is involved in an accident and they survive the crash . .. because they were not wearing a seat belt, then they must . .. be cited\" This is technically true, but it doesn't mean anything in practice. While seatbelts are mandatory by law, police officers have the ability to enforce or not to enforce the law, depending on the circumstances. Further, the cop will not be able to know whether or not a person was wearing a seatbelt while actually driving. And further, I did address my opponent's above statement - it just wasn't as direct as he must have wanted. I stated that laws are NOT made so that every single thing will always be perfect, they are made so that OVERALL, society will benefit. Sure, there will be times when laws do not make sense, exceptions if you will. However, we keep these laws around because despite their flaws, they serve a useful purpose. In the case of seatbelt laws, they save lives. And lastly on this point, we have one more fallacious statement: \"This is not supposed to be a socialist country, but rather a constitutional republic which protects individual's (emphasis added) rights and freedoms. \" Is it? My opponent certainly hasn't shown that it is, he's just assuming it is, because that lets him jump to his desired conclusion. === 2. I never said that revenue generation is not a consideration at all for seat belt laws. In fact, it is one of the reasons why seat belt laws should remain. To say that these laws should not exist requires an advocacy - it requires that someone change things - those someones would be state lawmakers in this case. These lawmakers not only want to protect their constituents, but they also want to ensure the strength of their government. Seat belt laws actually fulfill BOTH of these wants! Legislators have no substantial legitimate reason to get rid of these laws, thus the laws should remain. However, it is obvious that revenue generation is not the primary reason for seat belt laws. They are simply a positive secondary side effect thereof. This is evidenced by the fact that in most states, police cannot stop you solely for not wearing a seatbelt. This reduces the revenues a state can reap from the law, if they did want to harvest money from it. Also, remember that even with these restrictions, the law states that seatbelts are mandatory. === 3. My opponent points out that in one of my sources, the fine for adults who break the law is $10, while the fine for minors is $51.50. He assumes that this is because 'they' feel guilty enforcing it. First off, I'll point out that legislators make the law, and police officers enforce it. Police officers do not determine the fines, so the guilt they have enforcing it cannot possibly affect the fines. Let me conjure up a separate explanation: money is a bigger problem for minors than it is for adults. Paying a small fine like $50 isn't too bad for an adult with a good-paying job - the real incentive to wear a seatbelt for this age group comes from the trouble one must go through when given a citation. Further, minors are still forming their driving habits, so it is much more important to get them to wear seatbelts. My opponent also brings up a supposed Police Officer he knows who refuses to uphold the law. That is only a testament to the hidden flexibility of a mandatory seat belt law. Sure, the law might make it mandatory that seatbelts be worn, but cops don't have to enforce it all the time. In fact, if all cops were like my opponent's supposed acquaintance, then my opponent would have nothing to complain about. In fact, it accomplishes the same thing as his advocacy, removing the laws, except is saves us the trouble of actually removing the laws - therefore, it is a superior advocacy, assuming the goals my opponent seeks are worthwhile. My opponent then reveals the real reason he opposes seatbelt laws - a personal experience. My opponent was in an accident, and he didn't wear a seatbelt, and he walked away uninjured. My opponent must be making a very hasty generalization, I assume - to advocate that therefore seatbelts don't help increase safety overall. In fact, the facts bear me out on it - seatbelt-wearing people die half as often in crashes as non-seatbelt wearing people. I have already given the source for this, and it has not been contested. === 4. My opponent admits that it is impossible to know which type of accident you will be in. However, from this, he somehow concludes that each person should decide whether or not to wear a seatbelt. That makes little sense - if individuals have no information about which type of accident they might get into, they are quite unqualified to make that decision. Here is something we DO know, though. When we consider all accidents on average, wearing a seatbelt is half as likely to kill you as not wearing a seatbelt. This is not a statistic concerned with individual accidents, it is a comprehensive statistic including all accidents. Fortunately, we have a body that can make decisions on this same scope - the government. We know that overall, in all accidents, seatbelts increase safety. Therefore, on this same scope, we have each person wear a seatbelt. Let me give an example to make the point more clearly, before this is all over. Let us say that there are two different games in a casino. Game A has odds that will, on average, provide you with twice the winnings of Game B. It is optimal, therefore, to play Game A with all of your money, and not play Game B at all. You see, the Government is the one playing in this casino, and we are its money. Of course, unlike money, we are autonomous decision makers. However, even with autonomous decision-making money, it would be best to at least try to make your money go towards Game A rather than Game B. That is exactly what the government is doing.

That money helps pay for an entire industry built around designing, manufacturing, installing and maintaining speed cameras, not to mention the army of administrators or the traffic police officers who spend time sitting in wait with a mobile camera instead of going after the more dangerous 4 million estimated drivers who are on the roads illegally. The money from fines now goes straight to the Treasury. (Local authorities were once allowed to keep it) Originally when cameras were first introduced in Britain they were used with honest intentions and erected at genuine accident black spots. But when the money started rolling in from drivers caught by these new devices the authorities realised how much money can be made if they keep on planting new cameras. If it really wasn\u2019t about the money then why have they focused so hard on an offence that causes just 5% of accidents and have done proportionally very little in preventing the other 95% causes of accidents? http://www.speedcameras.org In favour of road safety, not revenue Further to this opening argument.... The PACTS reply (and the pilot study and all their other quoted analyses) is based on a gross misuse of the figures in Highways Economic Note #1 (HEN1), which gives estimates for costs associated with a road fatality, serious injury, etc and also the value of preventing a fatality (VPF). The Costs are the true costs to the county of an incident (emergency services, hospital, repairs to roads, etc.), typically up to \u00a310,000 (for the worst case, a serious injury). The report makes it clear that VPF includes amounts for pain, grief, loss of earnings, etc. (totalling around \u00a31.5M for a fatality) and explains that VPF cannot be equated to costs. Any use of VPF to show return on investment is bogus and potentially fraudulent. The values assigned to pain, grief, etc are hypothetical amounts that someone might be prepared to pay to bring their loved one back, and are to be used to compare alternative road schemes. Those values do not exist and would never appear on a balance sheet. To get \u00a358M \"cost saving\" from two years of \"280 lives saved\", PACTS are using an average figure of about \u00a3100,000 as the costs of a fatality/serious-injury/minor-injury. This is a blatant misrepresentation of official government figures by a governemnt body. Further, most of the 280 reduction in KSI per year at camera sites is due to the statistical phenomenon \"regression to the mean\", in other words those 280 accidents would probably not have happened anyway, regardless of cameras. It is a fanciful number and bears no relation to reality (ask yourself how any camera can save a life!). So, with a massive reduction in costs per death/injury and a massive reduction in the number of \"lives saved by cameras\", the return on investment argument is exposed as totally bogus. I believe the \"return on investment\" in terms of safety/casualties is less than 5% per annum.

The lack of technology and archaic methods of investigation in the federal government is an issue brimming with opportunity, and potential. Because the criminal justice system has potential that is being unused, I stand firmly: Resolved: The United States Federal Government should significantly reform its criminal justice system by recording interrogations Let\u2019s examine two terms that will be used frequently in today\u2019s debate round. Definition 1. Custodial interrogation \u201cCustodial Interrogation\" means an interview which occurs while a person is in custody in a Place of Detention For the purposes of this round, I will be defining a place of detention as a federal agency\u2019s interrogation room. Definition 2. Electronic recording \u201cElectronic Recording\" means an audio, video or digital recording of a Custodial Interrogation, beginning with a law enforcement officer's advice of the person's constitutional rights and ending when the interview has completely finished.\u201d With the definitions in mind, let\u2019s move on to\u2026 The criterion, or the way I would ask you to weigh this debate round, is net benefits. Interviews are not recorded. Although federal courts are tentatively starting to record, and many state police departments are recording interrogations, Thomas P. Sullivan, stated that \u201cFederal investigative agencies do not routinely record custodial interviews. Rather, agents still make handwritten notes and later prepare typewritten summaries. This practice is sorely out of date.\u201d[1] Because the practice of handwritten notes is sorely out of date, I propose the following plan to enhance the federal criminal justice system. Agency and Enforcement: The United States Federal government Mandate 1: Mandatory Recording Congress will pass a law mandating that all federal custodial interrogations performed by federal agencies are electronically recorded. Mandate 2: Inadmissibility Handwritten notes will no longer be accepted as evidence. Mandate 3: Exceptions The following is a set of permissible reasons to provide handwritten notes: 1) If the suspect request that he not be recorded. This statement should be recorded. 2) Equipment malfunction. 3) If the federal officer reasonably believed that recordation would risk disclosure of classified information, and recorded an explanation of the basis for this belief. Funding: Funding will be appropriated by each federal agency as necessary. The estimated cost for this plan is 110 million dollars. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice would be paying for most of this, and they have extremely large budgets. In fact, this plan would cost .00001 times their budgets. [2][3] Timeline: Implementation will begin immediately after an affirmative ballot. Recording will be mandatory in two years. This plan would not only solve the problems with the status quo, but would also create several distinct advantages. Advantage 1. Officers and Suspects Protected One of the many problems with handwritten notes was the amount of arguments about whether or not the police officer used improper tactics to coerce a confession. Thomas P. Sullivan testifies to the usefulness of recording interrogations. \u201cRecording custodial interviews is a tremendous benefit to the criminal justice system. A permanent record is created of what was said and done, how suspects acted, and how officers treated suspects. Officers are no longer subjected to unwarranted allegations about abusive conduct; those who may be inclined to use improper tactics cannot do so because their actions and words are being recorded.\u201d[4] Advantage 2. Decreased possibility of wrongful convictions One of the most important advantages to this plan is that false confessions are easier to detect. Richard f. Ofshe, professor of sociology in the university of California, states that \u201cTaping also allows third parties to resolve the courtroom \"swearing contests\" that arise when the suspect and the police offer conflicting testimony about what occurred during interrogation. In disputed confession cases the discrepancies between police officers' and defendants' accounts clearly indicate that one of the parties is either lying or mistaken. Of course, interrogators are sometimes falsely accused of deviant conduct. In the usual case, however, the police officer's testimony is treated as far more credible than the citizen's, whose reputability is compromised by his status as a criminal defendant. In many of the cases documented in this article, however, the interrogator claimed that the confessor supplied information that only the perpetrator could have known--only to have the suspect subsequently proven innocent and his ignorance of the crime facts revealed. To more accurately resolve whether the interrogator used coercion, whether the suspect knew the facts of the crime, and/ or whether he was made to confess falsely, one conclusion is inescapable: interrogations must be recorded in their entirety. \"[5] Advantage 3. Efficiency Another benefit of recording custodial interrogations is that the whole system becomes more efficient, time-wise and accuracy wise. The Justice Project and Pew Charitable Trusts wrote in 2007: \u201cBy preventing wrongful convictions, electronic recording of custodial interrogations benefits the criminal justice system as a whole by increasing reliability and efficiency. Fewer wrongful convictions helps increase public confidence in the system. Recordingalsoleads to greater efficiency. in that an objective record of the interrogation would reduce the need for and duration of pre-trial hearings on suppression of confessions, as there would be a clear and comprehensive record for the judge or jury to review.This saves attorney, judge, and court personnel time and expense.\u201d[6] Advantage 4. Money Saved Even though this plan would cost at maximum 110 million dollars at the front-end, money would actually be saved in the long run. Thomas P. Sullivan stated: \"Most costs come on the front end, and they diminish once the equipment and facilities are in place and training has been given to detectives. In contrast, savings continue so long as electronic recording continues. \"[7] This evidence supports the fact that in the long run, as a taxpayer your money would be saved. Advantage 5. Improved Interrogation The police officer\u2019s concentration is improved by recording. This is confirmed by Thomas P. Sullivan: \u201cWithout the need to make detailed notes, officers are better able to concentrate on suspects' demeanors and statements. They no longer have to attempt to recall details about the interviews days and weeks later when recollections have faded.\u201d4 Advantage 6. Increased prosecution evidence The Supreme Court Special Committee on Recording Custodial Interrogations found that: \u201cEven if the defendant does not provide a confession, recordation of the entire interview allows the jury to see consistencies or inconsistencies or the evolution of a defendant\u2019s responses to police questions.\u201d[8] In the end, we see that switching from old-fashioned, hand-written notes to electronic recording will benefit the criminal justice system as a whole, providing a comparative advantage. Because the potential in interrogations is limited by our current system, I ask you to support reforming the criminal justice system, and do so by enacting our plan.

Content: 1. How it worksI'm not from the U.S. so correct me if I'm wrong but these US providers of traffic lights from what you say seem to be like the Private Parking Companies in the U.K. such as \"UK Parking Control - UKPC\" who issue tickets on privately owned land even though they are not backed explicitly by law (a grey area of law), and because many people can't tell whether they were issued by the council or police they often believe they must pay. Such companies can make millions each year by managing one or two car parks, and are often called cowboys because they wait to pounce on someone for leaving their car unattended for a second even to help someone who's collapsed [1]. Should you pay speeding, red light fines or any other fine if you don't have to? I don't believe you should pay if you are tricked in some way, or given a ticket unfairly. But I suspect the US providers of red light and speed cameras are not as shifty as you make them out to be. I have taken the following extract from a source of yours:\"Overall, people like them: In a 2011 poll conducted by the insurance institute, two-thirds of drivers in 14 big cities with cameras expressed support for them. And last November, voters in Longview, Wash., and Pohatcong, N.J., rejected ballot measures to remove the cameras\" [2]The cameras are not just a revenue raiser, they reduce the number of serious accidents, though it should be noted an increased number of accidents have occured due to drivers braking harshly to avoid getting a ticket. However furthur extracts below from the same source as above show the cameras are managed in a fair way.\"State legislation typically sets the ground rules for the use of the cameras, and then cities negotiate the specifics of the deal with the camera vendors. The vendors, which include American Traffic Solutions and Redflex Traffic Systems, install the cameras and generally charge communities a flat fee for camera rental each month\"\"The camera shoots video of the offender and sends it to analysts at the camera company for closer examination. If the analysts think the situation merits a ticket, they forward the video to local law enforcement agents, who review it again. Law enforcement officers have the final say about whether or not a driver receives a ticket\"If you are captured breaking the law on a video belonging to an official provider, which you can even view after committing an offence, you should pay. There is no good reason why someone other than an emergency vehicle should go through a red light. Drivers have a responsibility to keep their self safe, their passengers safe and other drivers safe via being medically and physically fit, not being distracted and not exceeding the speed limit etc. Apparently the yellow light have been shortened to increase violations and profit at the expense of causing more accidents. But on roads with limits of 25mph they last for 3 seconds, and at 55mphlimits they last for 5 seconds, see extract belowYellow light times will be increased from 3 seconds to 3.4 seconds on roads with speed limits of 25 miles per hour and increased from 5 to 5.5 seconds on roads with speed limits of 55 miles per hour. [2]I've done some smple caluclations, when travelling at 25mph (11.176m per sec) your car will travel 33.53m in 3 seconds. Your overall stopping will be between 12m and 23m (20mph - 30mph). When travelling at 55mph (24.59m per sec) your car will travel 122.94m in 5 seconds. Your overall stopping distance will be between 53m and 73m (50mph - 60mph). So, if you drove at a speed that allows you stop within the distance you can see to be clear and only go on at a yellow light if it appears after you have crossed the stop line or when you are so close to it that stopping might cause an accident, you wouldn't have a ticket, or an accident. Since you have recieved a ticket which you say was due to driving too fast then you have not taken responsibility and should pay. 2. Reasons you don't respond to these tickets The people who decide whether you should have a ticket or not after reviewing the video or photos will know if you've not paidbecause it will be held on a computer, and I'm sure you will recieve a number of letters or phonecalls reminding you if you haven't. Also video/photo evidence is reliable, and is reviewed by the police. I don't believe someone should not pay just because someone else could take their car, get caught on camera speeding and return the car, as people should be responsible for their own car but anyway this is not something that happened to you as you say you sped.The time length of yellow lights is being increased, and red light cameras are being removed in areas where low violations occured before the installations due to causing more accidents. This shows that safety is their main concern.3. SafetyThough more accidents have occured when red light cameras have been introduced, it is due to drivers inability to anticipate, and drive at an appropiate speed, so they are having to make split second decisions to brake or not at interesctions with lights designed for the speed limit, which is something they wouldn't need to do if they simply followed the law. If you accidentally go through a red light due to being tired, upset, angry, feeling unwell, distracted by kids in the back seat etc then you should have taken measures to prevent that. Unfortunately I can't read the letter my oppoent has provided as the writing is too small, I ask my opponent to provide a link to this. It would be great to read what it says about a formula to ensure motorist safety and adequate time to stop safely. I'd like to know why you think \"traffic cams violate physics which must be there to actually prove you were speeding, as seen in the letter\"Con does explain that it unlikely for anyone to be punished if they choose to ignore a speeding fine and this is a reason for not paying, but I believe that if you make a mistake you should pay for it, because if you don't accept you've done something seriously wrong like running a red light then you may end up killing yourself, killing others, or injurying yourself or others. Since the cameras operate fairly, there is no good reason not to pay.sources:[1] http://www.parkingcowboys.co.uk...[2] http://www.usatoday.com...", "qid": 49, "docid": "75e67d5-2019-04-18T14:32:04Z-00002-000", "score": 7.656799793243408}, {"content": "Title: CCTV Cameras Should Be Operating In All Public Locations Content: I believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every public space where possible; on the streets, inside public buildings and (ideally) in remote areas such as fields and forests.

This is what they were always going to use them for thankfully they don't have them every were but they are a safety precaution to let driver's know, and also show them they were in the wrong and they could have been killed if they got into a crash. But not just that you are trained, shown how to drive you need to remember those rule's it\u2019s the law there is not excuse it\u2019s for everybody\u2019s safety. ARGUMENT 2# Now you are arguing that our rights are taken away when we take don't take responsibility for our OWN actions. Common sense should have told you own up to what you do wrong if not why would you be on the road you should be walking not driving. Now you claim \u201cWe aren't robots and we have rights. \u201d Ok that\u2019s fair enough but we still have to obey the law and rules, but not just that, you should have learnt from school and \u201cLife\u201d that disobeying the law is not acceptable. If that is not enough you claim that Citizens should not have to shell out hard earned cash, why not? You broke the law and the rules set in place for your safety and the others around you. If you don\u2019t see the point in red-light camera\u2019s you need to take a step back to realize the bigger picture for example: Safety for you and other\u2019s Another income for the government to pay for everything other\u2019s wreak while running a red light\u2019s Now you may oppose this idea but if you were to take every Red-light camera down and let the traffic go wild, you would surely see that there would be 10 times more crashes then there would be if there were not red-light camera\u2019s. ARGUMENT 3# How can you possibly assume there is going to be black boxes\u2019 in car\u2019s there is no way this is going to happen. Now you claim that there will be a camera, radar gun, and a \u201cblack box\u201d all going to go off at the exact same time making your case nothing, now this is highly unlikely unless you are doing 200 KPH down the main street, and this assumption you are throwing that we should not have to pay a fine that you committed on your own why won\u2019t you own up and take responsibility for what you did wrong. You should know the age long quote \u201cA picture tells a thousand words\u201d you should know that a picture go against everything you say if it is on paper you don\u2019t have a case this is where common sense should kick in and own up to your mistakes and cough up and get on with your life. The only person losing when you dispute the ticket is you. Beside the point you have claimed you believe that people have possibly edited your picture that landed you in all this mess, now this can be true but 99% of the time the government can be trusted in that section but not any other sections. ARGUMENT 4# You claim that it was good before red-light cameras were invented no it was hell for the council and the local police to deal with crazy drivers and hear about people going crazy up streets acting \u201ccool\u201d. But not only that they got into crashes and killed others, and as soon as the red-light camera was implemented there was a sharp fall in illegal doings that citizens were doing in there car\u2019s. Yes I agree that people fought wars to keep us free but we still are free to go about what we want to do if it is safe for us and everybody around us near and far. Now I want you to consider this if you were traveling 110 KPH down the highway it\u2019s a busy day busier than normal you have cars everywhere and you are running late you have just seen the light turn to yellow so you speed up but little do you realize you have no seat belt and you have just run a red-light now you have tens of cars hurtling towards you as you enter the intersection. Then you are then hit by a car from the right then as you are hit you are smashed against the window you then are dragged across by other cars if thing\u2019s could not get any worse the cars have pushed you just enough to nudge you into the other side of the lane you are then hit by another car from the left this second car has hit you with enough power that you are ejected through the FROUNT windscreen you then promptly die as you hit the asphalt if the cars impact had not already killed you. There is not official fact stating that they cause more \u201crear end crashes. \u201d But there has been a survey taken that shows the majority of people want the red light cameras because it enforces the law not breaks it like corruption in the police force.

In the source CON posted he mentions that the crowd scattering damaged his second camera. We have the same amount of destroyed property in this story by both protestors, and officers, yet one is assumed malicious and not the other. A member of the press that was assaulted by an officer - who was immediately suspended.These events are isolated, and individuals, not agencies, are being hostile towards civilians or media. CONFISCATED EQUIPMENT \"Several cameras were confiscated and videos deleted. The Al Jazeera crew's equipment was confiscated for several days\" There are no reports of any photos, videos or documentation being taken from journalists. This is the video of the event occurring, which can be seen here (4) and described below: 1:30 the officers can clearly be seen gently setting two lights on the ground 1:40 two officers carefully point the camera down 1:50 an officer bumps another light pole and holds it while pausing to make sure it wasn't going to fall. They can then be seen climbing back into their vehicle and moments later approach the crew that just recorded the event. The officers inform the crew they are going to a new location, and don't seem at all agitated and even have their backs to them. I'd like to point out to everyone reading that the claim my opponent just made was highly dishonest. \"Pro argues that a temporary suppression doesn't count as suppression. The constitution disagrees.\" Misleading. Temporary detainment, mistakes, and cases of isolated abuse don't count as the entire body of law enforcement acting to suppress the media writ large. SPECIFIC INCIDENTS \"Get the F*** out of here, Turn off that light, how dare you, if you turn on that light, you're getting shot with this\" The actual quote \"Turn off that light, get down, get the f*** out of here, you keep that light off, or you're getting shot with this, get the f*** outta here, you're in our way!\" (5) Seconds after, another officer is summoned, who makes no attempts to move the crew. Assurances are made that the officer threatening would be brought up to Cpt. Johnson, the man in charge, and the officer speaking with the journalist offers his own name as a reference to the situation. \"I'll bust your a$$\" To continue quoting Ernst, the man who was unreasonably harassed \"The vast majority of the officers I met around St. Louis were doing the best they could in a difficult and dangerous situation. But the kind of officer who we encountered - one who uses his authority to bully the public and press simply because he is protected by the law and a gun - gives others a bad name.\" (6) He openly states the majority of officers AREN'T attempting to bully the press. \"'I'll kill you' a police pointing a rifle at civilians says to the civilians.\" Immediately relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely. This has nothing to do with the media being suppressed and should be dismissed from consideration. (7) ARRESTED JOURNALISTS \"dozens have been arrested unconstitutionally. Their ability to report was suppressed during the hours they were detained.\" Twice CON has said \"dozens\" and twice CON has said \"over a dozen\". Only 11 have been arrested according to: http://www.cnn.com... http://www.poynter.org... http://www.huffingtonpost.com... http://www.washingtonpost.com... http://therealnews.com... Ryan Reilly, Wesley Lowery, Kerry Picket, Scott Olson, Ansgar Graw, Frank Herrmann, a third unnamed, Lukas Hermsmeier and Ryan Devereaux, Alderman, and Bilgin Sasmaz. \"No paperwork on the arrests have been issued.\" Please provide a source claiming that no documentation occurred for these arrests. I submit this for consideration: https://www.muckrock.com... POLICE INTENTIONS \"police have a vested interest in controlling the perception of their officer and their police force in the eyes of the public.\" By suspending bad officers (7) apologizing for mistakes (9) and marching with protestors (10). \"They have a vested interest in assassinating the character of the deceased\" The robbery video? Media forced the release by \"bombing them\" with FOIA requests the same day the officers name was forcibly released. (11) \"vested interest in labeling the protesters as looters, so their concerns and complaints will be dismissed.\" \"This is my neighborhood. You are my family, you are my friends. And I am you. I will stand to protect you. I will protect your right to protest.\" Cpt. Johnson of the state police. (10) PROTEST TIMELINE \"The protests have not been happening every day. The past 3 nights have been peaceful in Ferguson\" I said \"almost every day\" and I would still be right if I hadn't, I wrote that statement on the 19th, 3 days ago. Protests and riots shouldn't be lumped together. Much like CON is not distinguishing between good and bad cops, the violent and non-violent protestors aren't the same. \"Pro believes that the media scrutiny is unnecessary because the FBI is now investigating\" Incorrect and dubious. I claim that a crackdown doesn't prevent FBI involvement chronologically, as the FBI was involved already. \"as it took several days before that decision was made.\" 2 days. \"desire to see their fellow officer protected, and they know an accurate and honest accounting of events is not likely to produce that result.\" Baseless accusation. prejudice is cried if the same statement was applied in reverse. \"(The FBI investigation) was in response to the outrage over police suppression of the media\" Baseless and faulty. The FBI is investigating the shooting and department. Also contradictory to CONs previous statement, is it several days or 2? \"FBI investigation has nothing to do with whether or not the media was actively suppressed by the authorities in Ferguson\" Unless it's supporting evidence I used in a timeline, for example \"X couldn't have been to prevent the FBI since they were already there\". Another CON contradiction: \"FBI investigation was in response to outrage of media suppression\" \"FBI investigation has nothing to do with whether or not the media was suppressed.\" \"None of those entities are media. None of this has any bearing on the argument.\" By trying to disregard the fact that multiple agencies are involved, CON attempts to make \"law enforcement\" appear singular and monolithic. CON committed this fallacy several times to avoid the complications that arise when including thousands of extra people in a conspiracy. I hope you, dear reader, are having a blast reading long lines of text from strangers.

Better security would lead to less shootings, bullying, and Sexual Harassment. Better security would lead to better health and safety of students as well as staff. To begin with, better security in schools would lead to less mass shootings relating to students inside of a school campus. According to The Washington Post, the have been over 300 school shootings (meaning a gun was discharged on a school campus) since 2013. That means at least 1 a week. This number would be reduced dramatically if school security was a big priority. Students go to school to learn and should not have to burden the stress of academics, and the stress of a possible shooting, or dangerous incident. The numbers of shootings would be reduced dramatically by adding metal detectors, police officers, and locker checks around the school. With more security, bullying would be noticed more easily than without. In many schools, bullying has a zero tolerance policy, but oftentimes this is overlooked. Often the student has no way to stand up for him/her self, and may find it difficult to find someone they trust to speak with. With cameras, and officers around the building, bullys would be caught easily, and would immediately face consequences. Sexual harassment is a huge problem in schools that can be illegal, and needs to be responded to by higher authority. With cameras and officers, the amount of sexual harassment in schools would be lowered, and consequences would be established. 8 out of 10 students will experience sexual harassment from peers or teachers, and 6 out of 10 will experience physical sexual harassment from another peer or student. This is in all grade levels, and could be at least lowered if there were more cameras in schools. Some may say that using money on security is a waste, and that crime will happen either way regardless of the set security. Although not all crime can immediately be stopped it can be reduced to a much smaller number with even a small amount of extra security. Someone trying to commit a crime in a police station with armed officers will have a harder time trying to commit a crime in a school bus where there are no present armed officers. Schools should have better security whether it be cameras, officers, door checks, locker checks, or even just locked doors.

Content: Thank you for your quick response, Lwerd. 1. My opponent seems to have missed the point presented; while I make no claims to the contrary that there exists police abuse out there, my point is that giving Joe Citizen a camera may not lead to the proper use of such video as my opponent describes, in a court of law to catch these abusers. Much like the \"nanny cam\" example my opponent gave, unless a crime is actually committed, what purpose is there to it? Given that nanny cams have also been used to violate privacy in voyeur cases, there clearly is many alternative uses for nanny cames that may not quite fall under my opponent's consent. This is the same issue that comes with recording interactions with the police; what is actually right, and what is blatantly a violation of privacy and protection? 2. My source, if Pro had followed along as intended, was to demonstate the fact that the internet has given criminal networks a completely new tool to affect police operations - nothing more, nothing less. Moving on, the entire idea has been this: the internet, modern mass media, and other things allows people with a certain bias to do what they will with whatever they have, regardless of the consequences it can create. My point has been that police - also people too - are going to be subjected to unnecessary stress caused by videos that scrutinize actions, or just plainly misrepresent the facts, not to mention the privacy concerns, recognized already by courts, for which much of the current laws in place are based on[1]. 3. My opponent forgets that, going with her example, in order to stop many drinking and driving cases, there has been a major campaign, supported by police, to stop inebriated drivers from even getting into a car - stopping the problem before it becomes one, because how do we know they won't kill someone? The same is true with recording the police; without the benefit of hindsight, we don't know what their actions will lead to. My opponent wants to punish those that breach this right; so, like drunk driving, is it not better to stop it before it even happens? I'm not talking about illegalizing recording devices, here, any more than I'd advocate illegalizing alcohol - just that we need to stop a problem, like drunk driving, from occuring before it even happens. 4. Aside from the amusing noting of using Nags as a source, my opponent misses the point. She says police should feel comfortable - they don't. Several officers have testified to this fact[2]. In a study done by a British organization, interviewing police officers who were being recorded by Britain's extensive CCTV system (their own recording system, nonetheless!), the report found \"... When asked whether the introduction of surveillance cameras had affected their work, themajority of police officers interviewed initially responded by stating that the presence of CCTV had not had any impact on the way in which they carried out their duties or exercised their powers.... When pressed on the issue of how CCTV had affected their behaviour on the streets, however, over two-thirds of the officers interviewed conceded that the introduction of cameras had forced them to be \u2018more careful' when out on patrol. 10 Some, for example, had heard stories of officers being prosecuted for unlawful arrest or assault on the basis of CCTV evidence, stories that had left them anxious about being watched and the possibility of their own activities being scrutinised. Others, particularly younger officers, found being under constant surveillance made them nervous and uncomfortable.\" The very same report also has officers praising this, and also has officers saying that they're afraid of actions being \"misrepresented,\" apparently a very common concern among officers. Clearly, an issue exists, even if my opponent says it shouldn't. 5(a). My opponent didn't look through my source, then. 5(b). This issue was addressed above; recording, like drinking, may not lead to misrepresentative video or drunk driving, but without benefit of hindsight, we don't know - hence why preventative measures should be in place. 6. Again, above. 7. My opponent should note that I said that with exceptions; recording technology, and the ability to record officers willy-nilly for whatever reason, is not an effective way of keeping police accountable. It can, no doubt about that - and those incidents should be protected under law. But, related to the next point, even if recording has been made illegal, the video survives, as it must still be used in court as evidence of any crime being committed; for those officers truly worried about their actions and being charged, it doesn't matter if it is illegal or not, as they will try to stop it anyways. 8. My opponent missed the point; the issue is whether or not officers who are truly bent on doing harm would tolerate video recording anyways, whether it was legal or not. The common sense answer is a plain no; if an officer wants to make good on any threat, he will, and would most likely dispose of any video recording, or audio, or whatever, anyways. Under the current laws in place, the recording survives still as evidence of a crime being committed - meaning that, officers doing wrong or right being recorded must maintain the integrity of that recording in order for any charge to come up. Officers wanting to do harm, do not. 9. In conclusion, again, my opponent has not refuted my positions effectively. Recording the police in abusive situations is fantastic - but if its not happening, why should Joe Citizen be able to unnerve officers, misrepresent facts, and have free will to violate officers privacy? It makes little sense, and I urge a vote for CON. Thank you, and good luck in the last round, L.

What I am arguing is that public area are free of watch, and have less strict rules. Adding the cameras takes away this idea. On my number 2. I never said you have to provide a plan, all I am saying is that your plan will be too expensive. Also, in debate, you are supposed to persuade the judge or audience to vote for you, by stating why your world would be better than mine. And by not saying how much this will cost, or HOW it will be done, the judge can't know what will happen in your world. Also, guards cost less than cameras(Ill further explain in my number 4) On my number 3. First of all, don't listen to his argument of no counterplans. I am saying why surveillance cameras should not be substantially increased(Cost, and efficiency) And giving an alternative.(Linking back to my number 2) I am giving why cameras should NOT be substantially increased, and why guards should be, so disreguard this argument. Next, The cameras can show where they are. Thats it. They don't physically stop them. What if the viewing area for cameras is on the 3rd floor of a building, and the criminal is getting away THAT SECOND. Immediate action is needed! So in this case, guards do that. On my number 4. So lets continue this cost argument. For a Target that has, lets say, 2 cameras, you're going to need about 10 cameras, one for each corner, one near door, one near electronics, and others spread throughout. So if I agree that they cost around 2 thousand dollars(I do) Thats 2 thousand times 10, which is 20,000. Compare that to my 4760. Its a huge difference. My plan is more cost efficient. Also, cameras don't always keep criminals off. If they did, there would be no crime in places with cameras. Period. Which isn't true. In my area, there are flashing blue lights(Police cameras) around many corners, and are crimes committed? Yes. Guards would be more efficient. Also, his argument about no counterplans is abusive. He provides a plan/idea, and I counter it with disadvantages, and another plan/idea. Without my say in the debate, its not a debate, and not fair. I said why Surveillance cams should NOT be substantially increased, and what to do instead. This is fair. Now, to my opponents case. 1) You don't accomplish complete saftey. What trustworthiness do you get from a guard on the third floor, running after someone on a skateboard? And fine, for this part of the argument, I'll specifically talk about why cameras shouldn't be added, and don't help. 2)To keep security guards out, extend my number 2 and 3, stating that cameras are expensive, and don't stop the criminal. 3)His definition of substantial is right, but not appropriate for this debate Substantial-to a great extent or degree A set number of cameras isn't needed. All I am saying is explain why the number of cameras now isn't working, how to fix it, and how it will impact the company/place in a positive way. This is a Should resolution, yes. And with that, these answers are needed WHY should this happen? HOW is this going to help? HOW is this the BEST solution(Most important) The argument of why it is best will be key in this debate. If my opponent says that all computers should be white, I want to know why this needs to happen, why he wants this, and how white is better than black.

Content: Traffic speed cameras detect traffic regulation violations, such as speeding, vehicles going through a red traffic light, unauthorized use of a bus lane, and recording vehicles inside a congestion area. There are some groups, such as the National Motorsists Association (NMA) in the USA which claim that the systems \"encourage revenue-driven enforcement\" rather than the declared objectives. The NMA are in my opinion simply mad, they oppose the installation of red light cameras, encourage motorists to challenge all trafic tickets in court and have even encouraged many drivers to be inconsiderate by asking them to stay in an overtaking lane in a caravan at the posted speed limit on a few local highways leaving the far left lane open in an attempt to prove the speed limit was unreasonably low [1]If people obeyed the law and followed sensible advice then roads would be much safer and journey times would be improved. Anybody who puts lives at risk by speeding etc needs to be punished to help them adopt the correct attitude. Traffic cameras do the work of police but 24/7 on sections of roads where traffic calming measures would be unsuitable. I'm not sure goverments sign contracts with businesses who cut the police in at 30% but if I am totally honest I was suprised to find America has speed cameras because I always thought they chopped them down when they were introduced. I ask my opponent to provide a reliable source to show how the law cannot hold you liable for a ticket.\"It\u2019s commonly believed signing the ticket is an admission of guilt, but this is false. It\u2019s simply a confirmation that you received it\" [2] So, you are not agreeing to anything! And people can dispute the charge later.There is also a myth that you can just throw traffic tickets away due to traffic tickets not transferring to other states. However \"the Driver Licence Pact is an agreement among 46 member states that makes it virtually impossible to shirk the law. Disregarding tickets can lead to further criminal charges\" [2] You can't even escape speeding fines gained on holiday by just ignoring them, as British drivers are finding out after coming home from Spain [3]If you could actually save hundreds of dollars by simply ignoring speeding tickets or throwing them in the bin you'd believe your driving is acceptable and then continue to drive recklessly, which could result in serious injuries or loss of life.

If these people took the gradient, road condition and other factors affecting the stopping distance, like they are supposed to, then they would not recieve a ticket, and less people would die or become seriously injuried.In round 1 he says \"I got a ticket from driving too fast in an instersection, the camera caught me, sent me a bill\", so he admits he was speeding i.e. breaking the law. This is why I think my opponent should pay the bill sent to him. My main argument from the start was this: if you believe your driving is acceptable and continue to drive recklessly, it results in serious injury or loss of life. Can we rely on people's conscious? I believe my opponent simply disagrees with the way in which he was caught breaking the law. I've now read the letter by holding ctrl and moving my mouse button up to zoom in, and know now he was driving too fast in a 40mph zone and caught because the yellow light lasted 3 seconds instead of 4.5 seconds, which confirms this belief.Although it may be unlikely he will have to pay if he went to court due to the police being unable to prove he was sitting in the driver seat, the speed limit changing and the yellow light time not being adjusted resulting in the wrong yellow light time, and similar things, I do believe if you do break the law you should be punished by the law, in your case the punishment is paying a fine, if you leave it to your conscious to punish you you might just continue driving dangerously. It is therefore important to accept a punishment when you have broken the law no matter how you are caught.Thanks for reading, Kirk", "qid": 49, "docid": "75e67d5-2019-04-18T14:32:04Z-00000-000", "score": 7.426499843597412}, {"content": "Title: someone should go around video interviewing cops who shot calm, unarmed people (and were filmed) Content: First of all, may I just point out that pro has not provided a usable model whatsoever. For a legitimate model, pro needs to give examples, and an exact method of how this scheme will work from all aspects. To show what I mean, I'll just refute parts of the model. it happens way too much For this argument to be valid, pro needs to provide proof that this is a reoccurring incident. How much is 'too much'? This is opinionated. What is 'to much' in pro's view may not be to much in another's view. it would only take 300-400$ in gas for a little road trip. Again, pro has not given sufficient detail. His first statement was \"this happens way too much\", implying that there are innocent people being shot by police all over the globe. He then says interviewing all these policemen would take 'a little road trip' which costs only '$300-400'. These two arguments clearly contradict. If there really are as many deaths around the globe as pro is suggesting (without legitimate proof), the cost of fuel would be AT LEAST AUD$15 000. When pro gives detail about the actual distance of the trip, then we can make an approxiamation of the correct pricing of the journey using sources 1 and 2. For this point I ask pro to provide a scope and the information I have asked. . .. they need to be summoned to answer publicly for what's on the video or be shown in the compilation of cops avoiding the camera interview. I do not understand this sentence fully. I believe what con is trying to say is \"police need to participate in the interview\". Under what consequences? What if the police avoid the camera interview? Again, sufficient detail is necessary. we should start a crowd funding campaign to do this Again, detail is needed. Who is 'we'? And what kind of funding campaign? How big will the campaign be, and targeting who? Even if there is a fundraiser, it is undoubtful that it will raise the required price of the journey. Gaining sufficient funding will require a long amount of time and effort. It raises the question: is the cause really worth it? i can ask them the tough questions What questions- Who let the dogs out? Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar? For this debate to properly proceed, we need an understandable model to base arguments on. Is there going to be a fundraiser which raises over $10000 so you can ask police \"tough questions\" followed by a big guy holding a boom mike? This plan is lengthy, costworthy and has no aim specified by pro. we just need a big guy holding the boom mic to back me up. . .. And a video camera. And the adresses of various policemen. And transport. And money for fuel, stop-offs, food. And proof of the police-man's actions. And perhaps a lawyer. And so on. There is much more you need for an expedition like this. One last detail I request from pro is: what is the aim of this trip? Now, my points.1. Economical issuesAs I specified before, a trip like this will require $15 000 MINIMUM. That is excluding food and accommodation, along with other necessities. What pro does not realise here, is that an expensive journey like this would require extensive research and funding. This lengthy process is not worth the cause. Pro has specified that the money will be raised through a campaign. What he has not specified is details about this campaign, including: where, when, how, who. .. .2. What is the aim? So far, pro has only talked about questioning police. He has not sprcified what questions and what is the aim of his questioning. Is he attempting to sue/frame police? Is he trying to bring them to justice? We do not know.3. Small chance of workingNot only has pro hardly specified or given details about his model, he has not explained how this will work. I as con am assuming that he is trying to take them to court. If so, this has a small chance of working. First of all, if the policemen did shoot innocent people, they are most likely in prison. It is against the law to shoot an innocent person, no matter the job. Secondly, after pro has interviewed these police-men, he then has to take them to court. He would need extensive research and evidence to back up his claim, and the police may not admit to being guilty in their interview, showing a waste of money.4. Why just policemen? Why is pro limiting this debate to just policemen, when policemen are not the main cause of innocent murders? Police cause a minority of deaths among people, and most of these police men are locked up already. If pro really had the public's interest in concern, he would spend the money made through fundraising on more important issues, such as using the funds to help police on current issues involving murders. In conclusion, these are my points and rebuttals so far. The points are very brief since I am lacking in knowledge of what the aim of this scheme is.

I'll jump straight into my rebuttal.if i need to provide proof that there are too many killing of unarmed, unthreatening civilians by law enforcement, i worry for this debate. it's such a simple, basic fact that there are tons of videos online of cops shooting these people, but no videos of the cops explaining their actions or apologizing. It doesn't matter whether pro \"worries for this debate\". As part of your job of proving your case, you must provide proof of your arguments. I do not see any proof of \"too many\" murders by police. Therefore you have not backed up your argument. Also, you say \"tons of videos online of cops shooting these people\", but where is the proof of this? Pro, in this incident, hasn't even provided links to such videos. So again, pro has not backed up his argument. And on a side-note, it would make it a lot easier to debate this if pro used numerical terms instead of hyperbole such as \"tons\" or \"too many\".let me establish that i am not interested in winning a debate - i think it's silly to debate to win points. i find learning and truth much more appealing.Then may I ask, why are you on a site where people vote for winners of debates?nothing i said is \"implying that there are innocent people being shot by police all over the globe.\"Again, I am faced with a contradiction. Pro keeps mentioning the \"tons of innocents getting shot\" and \"it happens way to much\", and then he fails to not only set a scope for this debate, but claims he will only take a small road trip. If he does claim that, then what is the point? Making a small road trip may not even encounter one of these policemen, when there are \"tons\" (as pro keeps suggesting without proof). He is talking up a big problem, and then only making a half-hearted effort to fix it. If pro is to set up a model like this, \"a small road trip\", it raises some questions. How small is small? What country/place are we looking at for the setting of this road trip? And why only limit the road trip to a small one when there are supposedly \"tons\" of policemen out there needing to be brought to justice (as pro keeps stressing)? These details are vital to pro's model.This is a half-hearted way to attempt to fix a problem that isn't there, as I will come back to later on.maybe this is partly my fault for having a good idea and asking others to find problems with it on a site where people are trying to make debate into a game rather than a method of truth seeking.Don't put this on DDO. If you really want me to just accept your arguments and not find faults in them, don't put them on a debating website. Full stop.i don't understand how you don't understand my sentence or can ask \"What if the police avoid the camera interview?\" - when the answer is at the end of my sentence that you quoted - i.e. they will \"be shown in the compilation of cops avoiding the camera interview\" when they hide their face on the way to their home, etc. I don't understand this statement either. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I think you're trying to say that there will be a \"compilation of cops hiding their faces\" video? If this is the case, cops hiding their faces do not count as evidence in a court. If you present that video before a judge, he will not just casually say \"well, Fred here is hiding his face, so he must have murdered Freda!\" No. It does not work like this. Pro has a strange image of the way evidence works. ...does not need to be specified as 500 or 5000 or even 50,000$ as all are equally worth spending on such an important film.Where do you draw the line? $50 000 is an unnecessarily HUGE amount of money for a tape of perhaps one police man \"hiding his face\". The chances are minute that pro will succeed in getting an apology or confession out of these police that pro is targeting. And again, there is a contradiction. Pro, at the start of the debate, metions it will cost $300-$400 on this road trip. Now he is suggesting $50 000. I ask that pro gets his model organised before he proceeds.if this debate is going to proceed, you need to explain to me how i have not specified an aim. In pro's first argument, he did not mention once the aim of his scheme. He just suggested the idea of filming guilty police without specifying why he would be doing such a thing. He did not say anything about bringing them to justice. Therefore, all I could do was ask for an aim to be specified.the fact that con needs more information to go on tells me that he does not disagree with the basis of my argument. ???I needed more information so I could have a substantial case to disagree with in the first place.i was hoping to find a real police apologist or someone who could tell me about similar documentaries that are already being done, rather than someone to find problems where there are none.I was hoping for an opponent who didn't tell me what to argue.Also, there is such a documentary. It is the news.the aim of this trip, which should be clear, is to bring light to the issue which i described.\"Bringing light to the issue\" is a sad aim for such a complicated process. Interviewing these policemen about their past on a \"road trip\" that costs $50 000 is a rocky process for such a small aim. So, just to clarify, the aim of this whole scheme and fund-raising is to make people aware of this issue?15,000$ based on a silly inference is a waste of time arguing against.Yes, you are right. You said you needed $50 000 earlier. $15 000 is far too low.the aim is for them to answer publicly for their crimesAgain, another contradiction. Pro has stated before that the aim was to \"shed light on the issue\". Now it has changed again to as stated above.what a crazy assumption, that i am trying to take them to court - i have said nothing that would lead anyone to believe that. i said they need to \"answer publicly\" for their actions.Then it is a crazy idea. It would be like making a serial killer confess under a camera, then not use that evidence to bring the killer to justice.most of the cops are locked up in Oz maybe, but again - welcome to america.We [Australians] do not routinely send people out with cameras filming police. We have these policemen in prison. Doesn't that tell you that filming policement is not the way to go about this?Now, my points (expansion):1. Economical issuesFirst of all, this process pro is suggesting is either unnecessarily expensive, or pointless. To clarify what I mean: to make this trip thorough, pro is suggesting the costs come to $50 000. This money can be used in better ways. It can be donated to the police or criminal investigation unit to help catch and bring to justice more criminals. The investgation unit would be a lot more thorough in catching criminals through their investigations then pro would be with a camera trying to film policemen hiding their faces. Then he suggests $400. This would make the trip drastically cheaper, but would only get him approximately 500km, since much of the money would have to be spent on food and accommodation. 500km would only encounter perhaps not even one policeman, and even if this policeman is found, the chances are minute that he will even suggest admitting to his past.2. Small chance of workingAs I stated before, the chances of a police officer confessing to his actions are minute. And, as I said before, he needs extensive evidence to back his claims. He cannot turn up at one of their doors and expect them to let him in, let alone a confession. The chances of this working are so small it is not even worth executing the plan. 3. Poor idea to fix an unproven problemIf pro was really in need of fixing this problem, filming policemen is a weak way of attacking the issue. With $50000, pro could donate it to investigational forces who will focus on current criminals. Also, pro has not even proven that there are criminal policemen in the first place. He has not provided research to prove there are videos of such incidents.I am out of characters.

I hear they are giving out tickets to people who don't wear seat belts with these cameras. What if the seat belt happens to be the same color as your shirt? Next they want to have \"black boxes\" in cars so they know every detail of what you do. They might as well sell cars with credit card readers, too, so you can just pay the fines instantly. No need for courts.You'll have at least 25 violations on your trip to the corner store. You didn't signal fast enough, you forgot to check your mirror, you went 1 mph over the speed limit, you parked 1/2 inch too far away from the curb, you touched a double yellow line with a tire.... If you say, \"We are giving our rights away, because we consistently fail to accept responsibility for our actions.\". You can't be serious. OK...if every car is supposed to be stopped behind some line the microsecond the light turns red, then why not just have a wall pop up where the line is? Nobody will ever hit the wall if they don't break the law, right? Blame yourself if you happen to crash into that wall. My point is, we need to take this on a case by case basis. That's why we trust the police to make a fair judgement before writing a a ticket, and if the officer was wrong with his judgement, he/she can be challenged in court. This isn't about taking responsibility for our actions. This is about being treated like humans. We aren't robots and we have rights. Why should we let robots and machines be able to punish us without question? We aren't perfect, yet we are being held to perfect standards with no way to explain, no way to check if the camera was working right or even being tampered with. If you expect citizens to just shell out hard earned money and \"accept responsibility\" for everything that big brother accuses them of, you really need to move to Cuba. We are giving our rights away, because we are too busy, too complacent, too lazy, too ignorant and just to uncaring about the precious rights we now take for granted. When the day comes that you get 25 tickets a day for things you can't go to court for, because it's your word against a camera, black box, radar gun, or some other electronic device, then blame yourself. This isn't the Olympics where 1/100th of a second is justification for a ticket. There are many reasons and circumstances that people cross lines and go through lights that are justified. We are humans and we aren't perfect. Why should we be held to perfect standards? Why should we just pay a fine because a picture was taken? You care about the justice system? Normally a piece of evidence would have to go through a chain of command to prove it wasn't tampered with. Who printed this picture? How did they do it? What kind of printer? Was it working right at the time? How can we be sure it wasn't doctored? If I get a picture/ticket in the mail, I would demand that the every person involved with that picture, go to court and swear under oath what their roll was in handling this picture. That's my right. There is a system that has worked just fine since traffic lights were invented. It's called a police officer writing a ticket. It's Constitutional, it's safe, it allows you to confront the accuser in court. There is NO justification for giving up rights...not even safety. Wars have been fought and people have DIED to keep us free, and anyone who wants to throw it away because they think it will make them safe deserves neither safety nor freedom.

And now, after injuring two police officers, branding a firearm in a court house and, running from law enforcement, I was somehow going to be able to escape from all of this Scott free? This almost seemed too good to be true to have happened in the course of a day. But I had no reason to suspect that a police officer would lie to me. I decided it was kind of weird that he had randomly started to talk to me about the Jason Stiles case. I continued to run, while I considered my options. My girlfriend probably thinks I am a monster after my actions. Will she ever take me back? How will I be able to just continue on living the way I used to as if my parents weren\u2019t dead and I weren\u2019t responsible for one of them? How was I supposed to go anywhere, do anything without catching the attention of the public eye, people hating me, thinking I am a monster. I could not go back, free or not free. I decided that I was going to start a new life. Maybe go to church with the Talbot's, and find god. Maybe I will go my own way, and explore the world. I needed to find myself, and I needed to find peace, and going back to how things were before wasn\u2019t the way. I stopped for a minute, realizing that I had been running for over 6 miles. The road ended, with barricades saying \u201cEnd of Road\u201d. Behind that, there was a tree line, leading into a Forrest. As I let my cardio adjust, I sat down to rest my legs. I felt emotions, as I considered my situation. Starting over. I could find love, I can find happiness. Happiness\u2026 Was that even possible now? I had to believe it was. I had to believe I could over come this. I put my face in my palm, sighing. As I pulled my palm away, I noticed a little red dot on the back of my hand. What the\u2026 Shoot. It was a trap. \u201cJASON STILES, This is the FBI. Put your hands behind your head and lie flat down on the ground.\u201d Three Police officers emerged from the woodline, all aiming M4\u2019s at me. I knew the police officer that talked to me was baiting me, waiting for back-up. This was it. It was either death, or escape. I chose escape. I took my chance and bursted left behind one of the barriers. Whiz, Ping, Ping! Three shots were fired at me, one whizzing right by my head. Two more FBI agents flanked me from my right side. I did a barrel role as a couple more shots were fired. I realized they weren\u2019t shooting live ammo at me, but concussion shots based on the slow movement of the projectiles. I was exposed in the middle of all the FBI agents, as 4 more flanked me from my left side. No more escape routes were present options any more. I let out a cry, and dashed at the nearest officer, but didn\u2019t make it more than three steps before I was barraged with concussion shots, 2 to the head, three to the body. Everything went black. I woke up feeling pain all over my body, and a massive head ache. I opened my eyes, and felt blinded by a bright light in my face. I could see nothing, but bright, annoying, harsh light, so I closed my eyes. I tried moving my arms. They were numb, but heavy. I was hand cuffed, and my legs were cuffed together too. Sh1t. I was going to die for a crime that I didn\u2019t commit. Maybe I deserved it. Maybe this was how it was supposed to end. At least I wouldn't\u2019t have to think anymore. Maybe death would be easier than having to live a life in hiding, regret, and bad memories. Reverend Talbot lived a life of pain. That must have been torturous to endure for years on end. I didn\u2019t know if I was strong enough for that. Maybe the death penalty was the way to go. Maybe getting caught was a good thing. \u201cJason, glad see your awake.\u201d A low male voice said from what sounded like a few feet away from me. I tried to open my eyes, but was instantly blinded yet again by the light, making my head hurt even worse. There was a chuckle. \u201cHere, let me help you with that. Then there was a buzzing sound, and I felt my body moving upward. Noticing the brightness dim from behind my closed eyelids, I finally opened them. I saw that I was on a raising chair, in a small rectangular room, that I instantly noticed was moving. I had to be in the back of a vehicle. Across from me sitting on a stool was a handsome FBI officer. \u201cI have questions for you Jason.\u201d He said seriously, as he withdrew a notepad and pen from his shirt pocket.\u201d I looked around groggily, head pounding. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be in a position to be asking questions, but I think it should be obvious that you are in route to a holding facility, where you will be given lethal injection in one weeks time. But let\u2019s not get ahead of our selves. Where have you been hiding, Jason?\u201d He asked calmly, prepping his pen by removing the lid. I just said nothing. \u201cDon\u2019t test my patience Jason. Tell me what I need to know or-\u201c \u201cOr what?\u201d I said. \u201cYou cannot do anything to me. I will not talk. If I am dying in a week for a crime I didn\u2019t commit, then I have no obligation to tell you anything.\u201d I spat at the floor near him to emphasize my firmness. He just laughed, and stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d \u201c I did not kill my mother!\u201d I shouted angrily. \u201cI am not talking about that part. I am talking about the \u2018you cannot do anything\u2019 part. Take a look around you Jason. Do you see any cameras?\u201d he said with a smirk. I looked, and indeed, there was no cameras. He approached me, and put both thumbs on my eyeballs, forcing me to close my eyes. I struggled, and squirmed, but to no avail. The chair I was cuffed to impaired any chance for escape. Then he added pressure to his thumbs. I screamed in agony, as pain flooded into my eye sockets. I saw flashes, and colors, and blood\u2026. \u201cAGGGGGHHHHHHHH!\u201d Then the pressure stopped. And he pulled away. I was panting, and blood was coming from my mouth as I had bitten my tongue. I wearily opened my eyes, everything a blur with tears and blood. \u201cAre you going to comply with me now Jason?\u201d He asked, remaining calm. \u201cFvck you!\u201d I said, almost regretting saying it instantly, knowing pain would follow. I swallowed hard as I watched him remove a tiny remote. \u201cThen you leave me no choice.\u201d He said, and pressed the button. Electricity ran through my bones ravaging me. I couldn\u2019t even scream with pain, and my body writhes, jolted and bounced in the chair. The pain seemed to go on four hours. Finally it stopped. I was drooling, and crying. \u201cPlease\u2026 Please\u2026 Just kill me, please!\u201d \u201cAll in good time.

Then light flooded the truck, as the back door was open, revealing a figure. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here Jason, quick!\u201d Whoever it was then moved to help release me from my chair which I was now sitting sideways in, as it was bolted to the ground.", "qid": 49, "docid": "26896719-2019-04-18T17:28:23Z-00001-000", "score": 7.233399868011475}, {"content": "Title: Police Profiling Content: First of to counter your last point that the Officer could have spent that time stopping a crime or responding to a \"real police matter\".

You stated that the officer claimed the car was pulled over because it was unregistered, not so the officer could check if it was unregistered, not because the officer thought it was unregistered.

Content: Okay, I'll start with my opponent's case, move to mine, then I'll wrap it all up with some key voting issues in this round. Off of his 1 argument: He continues to uphold the idea that once a camera is put in a public area, that it is no longer public, but rather it becomes private. But you'll see as I defined private (not open or accessible to the general public) and as I defined public (open to all persons), that just because I put up a surveillance camera or several surveillance cameras in a public area, does not make it private. To be private is for something to not be open or accessible to the general public, and installing cameras does not take away public areas, in fact cameras keep the public safer. And just because someone thinks cameras are cramping their style does not mean you sacrifice the three Ss just so their style is not cramped. You cannot accept his 1st point because basic definitions and logic alone will tell you that just because I put a camera up in a public area, doesn't magically make it private area. Off of his 2 argument: First let's talk about the different worlds argument\u2026. .we are debating whether or not surveillance cameras in public areas should be substantially increased. We are no debating which world is better, more cameras or more guards. We are not debating that. The con burden in the round is to prove why we should not put more cameras up, but instead my opponent uses smokescreen tactics to try and avoid the actual dialogue of the resolution we should be discussing. Since it is a should resolution, it appears to be more philosophy based, and not so much who provides a better plan. Let's get back to the pros and cons of surveillance cameras, and let's not do this cameras (vs) guards debate\u2026. .because that is not what the resolution asks of us. Anyways, he brings up some economic arguments in this argument as well, but I'll discuss these in his 4 argument, so we can get to it all there. Off of his 3 and 4 argument: I need to touch on some major misconceptions and as a result, I will fuse my arguments against his 3 and 4 arguments into one long argument against both. Alright let's talk about some economics here. Even though it should not be cameras (vs) guards, I will show you why cameras are still more cost efficient. Okay, I do not really accept 10 cameras counter 2 security guards. But even so, the $4,760 dollars is based on how much they earn per week. That means multiple that by 52, and you will get the number the store has to pay the shifts of security guard every year. That number would be $247,520 dollars every year for two shifts at security guard. Whereas 10 cameras would only cost $20,000 dollars, maybe a little maintenance, but that can not counter the idea that 2 security guards cost more 12 times the amount of 10 surveillance cameras. In addition, as a report of job listings said on monster. com, a person who watches a surveillance camera is paid an average of 12 dollars per hour. So let's I even had 2 guys watching with 10 cameras all that cost together would cost $168,512. That is still dramatically less than the $247,520 dollars that two security guards alone would cost. Moreover, surveillance cameras can actually look at the entire store, whereas guards can only be in a certain little area at a time. Surveillance cameras do cost less and they do stop crime. So even though I believe we should you know\u2026\u2026actually debate the resolution, I still provide why surveillance cameras are better, because they cost less, they can view of more of the store, thus stopping more crime, and that's why they are better than security guards. Off his counter-plan argument he made after the 4 argument: Forgive me if I actually wanted to debate the resolution. I think we should have some direct debate about surveillance cameras and once again the pros and cons of why they should be substantially increased in public areas. I think that we should just debate the resolution, but as he continues with this counter-plan, I continue to offer two arguments, that 1) I believe we should talk about surveillance cameras and not bring up anything you could think of in a counter-plan, and 2) I beat his counter-plan anyways, with the effectiveness of viewing the entire store, and costing way less than security guards would. He thinks I'm cheating him, because I'm not allowing him to make up some plan to go against mine, but I'm not. I got handed the job of defending surveillance cameras and why they should be substantially increased. That is what I have to do, that is the burden of the pro. You would be cheating me if you decided to try to throw up smokescreens to the resolution. But nevertheless, you still try to uphold this counter-plan and whether or not the judge accepts or not, I have efficiently beaten it. Moving on to my case\u2026. . Off his attacks on my 1st contention: Surveillance do accomplish safety (dependable or trustworthiness), because they can view the whole store, the camera does not lie, it doesn't hold grudges, it doesn't have emotions, like a guard would, and a camera can only show the truth. Since it can only reveal and show the truth that makes it both dependable and trustworthy. Off his attacks on my 2nd contention: Of course cameras can't physically stop people. But the people assigned to watch the cameras can either stop them, they can call a manager, or call the police to take action. He pulls through his money totals, but I've shown why I win of those two. Plus, I like to point out that I don't ever have to get rid of security guards. He wants to get rid of surveillance cameras and only have security guards. But you see, the pro doesn't have to get rid of anything, by substantially increasing surveillance cameras, I don't get rid of anything. Because in the end, I can have my cake and eat it too, whereas he can't. Off his attacks on my 3rd contention: Increasing implies getting more, so I'm trying to avoid that I'm trying to get more surveillance cameras. But since he offers no dictionary source for substantial and he previously agreed with mine earlier, my definition is still upheld as the one in this round. I will answer all of your questions in my voting issues right now. Voting Issues: Why the number of cameras now isn't working, how to fix it, and how it will impact the company/place in a positive way? (I don't of course have numbers for each public place, but I can tell this is talking about a general impact, and by increasing the number of cameras I potentially insure the three Ss more. ) Why should this happen? (Because more surveillance cameras can bring more safety, security, and stability to society as I've explained throughout this debate round. ) How is this going to help? (By installing more cameras, more criminals are caught, less shoplifting will happen, and it will make people behave in a more civilized and un-criminal manner in public areas) How is this the best solution? (The resolution never specifies that I have to offer the best solution in the debate, but rather asks the question should this happen, as in\u2026is this a good thing. And yes, I do believe substantially increasing the number of surveillance cameras is good for society. More so, you're trying to compare guards to cameras again, but once again, that shouldn't be the debate, but even if it was I provide why cameras are better, but as I said before the Pro doesn't have to get rid of guards, I can have both them and cameras. But the Con's plan is essentially asking to eliminate cameras, and have the guards. So that's just another reason on top of the effectiveness and the cost that I win that part of the debate. ) CLOSING STATEMENT: I truly do believe you must vote pro, I win the round at it's pure core, and I win it even with his counterplan. I urge the judges to look at the arguments and see that the Pro does win the round.", "qid": 49, "docid": "8375938-2019-04-18T19:45:55Z-00000-000", "score": 7.110599994659424}, {"content": "Title: Crime cameras help reduce crime rates, Content: \"Cameras have cut violence, study says\".

He's failed to forward his own case and is now focusing on minimizing the impacts of mine. I've given a scenario of events that are not only a plausible alternative to how the events played out (the only thing I need to prove) but are also more likely to have happened than what my opponent has to offer. You'll read through my opponent's last round and you'll see that he is just trying to switch the BOP. Let's take this point by point. \"Because if Alexander had been killed by hollow point bullets, it would have been almost certain proof the gun used was the one stolen from the Arias household. Moreover, police could determine the exact brand of bullet used, and compare it with the police report or question the Arias family on it. Basically, by using regular bullets instead of the hollow points, Arias demonstrates premeditation - she carefully thought through the murder. \" There is no winning with my opponent. If the evidence doesn't point towards my opponent it's a sign of premeditation. If it does Than \"Checkmate\". My opponent correctly points out that over 5000 guns a year are stolen in Arizona. That's a big number. There is the same amount of evidence connecting Jodi to that gun as there is connecting Travis Alexander, which is none. \"First, he argues that if she used the gun was used after the stabbing, then it would not be indicative of premeditation. He argues that it wouldn't make sense for her to plan a murder where she stabs him first, and then shoots him - to that, I strongly disagree. The mere fact she brought a gun (with no concealed carry license) to a situation like this is clear evidence she planned to use it. \" First of all if the only thing my opponent has indicating premeditaion is this gun, he's in trouble. There is absolutely no evidence connecting Jodi to this gun. Second of all my opponent's scenario is stupid. Why would a premeditated murder involve stabbing somebody repeatedly and risking getting yourself killed in the process then after Travis is already dead or close to it shooting him in the head. This plan is dumb and would definitely not be something premeditated. If Jodi Arias wanted him dead, she'd shoot him in his sleep. It's as simple as that. \"Additionally, he argues that Travis Alexander might have owned a gun, even though there is no evidence he did. This is a silly argument - this is a serious debate, and my opponent has no evidence that Alexander owned one. \" I don't have to prove Travis owned a gun. I merely have to show reasonable doubt. It's possible that Travis owned an unregistered handgun. I've owned an unregistered handgun at one point. Lots of people own guns with no evidence of doing so existing. When I did own the gun, it's not like I went around advertising the fact that I did. It is an arrestable offense. So it's really no surprise that you wouldn't find anyone to testify that Travis Alexander did own a gun. Also since turnabout is fair play. .. .. .. . Additionally, TNO5 argues that Jodi Arias had brought a gun with her to Alexander's residence although there is no evidence she did. This is a silly argument - This is a serious debate and my opponent has no evidence that Jodi had one. \"having the camera throughout the killing (during and after) shows more or less that she was not defending herself, as no person defending themselves would have time to take a picture of the dead body. \" Clearly after Travis started beating the crap out of Jodi Arias, a lot of photographs were taken accidently. I don't know what you're trying to prove with this. \"if she stabbed (shot) first, she would have incapacitated him well before she started stabbing him in the back, and she would have had no need to further stab or shoot\" People survive shot's to the head, they often times can move around and are fully conscious after shots to the head. It's no gauruntee that the second it happens you'll die or be incapacitated. \"Of course, as I established in my opening statements, there is no evidence that Arias had even the mildest defensive wounds, while Alexander had defensive wounds on both hands. \" The defensive wounds have all been explained by how the fight played out. Jodi Arias had the upper hand the whole fight. Travis was wet and angry slipping and bumping into things, while trying to attack Jodi Arias. when he tracked her down to the bedroom, he had already body slammed her twice. The gun accidently discharged already and hurt Travis, making it even harder to get the upper hand. Regardless of who had and mantained the upperhand, it doesn't change the fact that It was completely in self defense and other than the slice to the throat every single wound could've been Inflicted on Travis Alexander while in defense mode. The only aggressive cut was to his throat in the one moment that Jodi was actually able to create some seperation. \"After she killed Alexander, she sent several voicemails to his phone to make it appear like she was out of state. [3] I've already established Arias did not have PTSD, and on the topic of the camera, the images were indeed deleted, but the camera was also thrown into a washer - presumably to render it further unusable. \" This is absurd. I've already explaied that Jodi Arias was a photograper and that she knew deleting the photos wouldn't erase them. She knew that removing the flash card would've did the job. She stuck the camera in the dishwasher to wash away the horror of the situation. \"My opponent has not established any conclusive link between the broken finger and domestic assault. Additionally, my opponent gives texts sent by Alexander to Arias. Contrary to showing domestic abuse, however, these seem to show simply anger - not abuse. During any break up people say things like this all the time. People fight. Words are not evidence of domestic abuse\" As I've already addresssed an expert on domestic abuse did read all the messages, including ones we aren't privy to and has concluded that Jodi was likely in an abusive relationship. She certainly has a broken finger which isn't to be disputed. It's certainly reasonable to assume it could be the result of domestic abuse. I've read a lot of those messages. I've posted some of them here' I've never been so mad at an ex that I would say those things. If you were hurt about things. If you cared about a person, youd wish them the best or just wallow in your own self pity. His response considered a person who had a lot of hate in his heart and was a user and abuser. Let's say he didn't have an abusive history, breaking Jodi's finger and forcing her to dress up like a little boy because he was attracted to children Even had this stuff not happened he is still capable of being violent in this situation. He is capable of chasing of body slamming her then chasing her in a moment of anger. \"On the topic of PTSD, my opponent asserts there is no reason to dismiss the PTSD theory. However, there is - my his own admission, the defense lawyer admits his diagnosis was flawed. The test was conducted while Arias was lying and insisting she knew nothing about the test (murder). In other words, the diagnosis is worthless, and the prosecution's expert has far more credibility at this point\" My argument was that he exmined the prosecutions evidence and concluded that the same evidence they looked at could also lead to the conclusion that Jodi Arias was suffering from PTSD. Samuals never said the diagnosis was flawed. He did say he should've administered the test at a later point as well, when she was being more honest but that is far from saying it was flawed. This is from my opponent's source. \"These tests, which I administered early, did confirm the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. Although, I was in error by not re-administering the [test],\". http://www.businessinsider.com... My opponent can't refute my version of events and fails to show why his version of events is any more reliable. Further more the whole gun argument is a double edged sword for him. If the gun went off first, then he has to accept my version of events. If it went off last it completely destroys his premeditation argument as that is the dumbest murder plot ever and just plain inconcievable. This poor girl had no reason to murder Travis Alexander. She is a beauitiful girl that can get any guy she wants. The whole jealous stalker narrative is outrageous . Why is it that when a girl is trapped in an abusive relationship people always blame the victim or make excuses. She is a stalker. She hit him first. You know how angry he gets, she shouldn't get mouthy with him. Jodi Arias was lucky and survived her situation, and even after her abuser is dead people are still trying to make excuses for him. It's clear that Travis had temper problems, even e-mails to his friends proved that. It's clear he viewed Jodi as less than human just read the end of my last round. The guy was either beating the crap out of her or a ticking time bomb to do that. Acts taken after a murder don't show premeditation. Jodi Arias covering up what happened because the police might misunderstand what happened proves nothing. In fact, judging by how things played out she was justified in doing so.", "qid": 49, "docid": "95de8852-2019-04-18T15:35:52Z-00003-000", "score": 7.055699825286865}, {"content": "Title: Should There Be Security Cameras In Schools Content: Do you think all security cameras cost $1000?

As he bounded himself to humanity, so he had become addicted to it - it was like a drug to him. The richness of human experience overwhelmed him. The texture of touch. The brightness of colour. The pressure of sound. He had bound himself ever tighter to Jonathon, not realising how vulnerable humans are. Now, as four bullets ripped through Jonathon's shoulder blades and stomach, he was flooded with sensory input that left him utterly defenseless. The flood of pain. His body screaming: SURVIVE. SURVIVE. FLEE. DANGER. It was so primitive, so unthinking. Humans have this side to them too?Releasing control to Jonathon for his last moments, he attempted to disconnect, but it was futile. He had bound himself too deeply. He was too addicted, too interconnected.\"I will not die here. I will not die!\"Ordinarily, his species did not have a strong survival instinct. Ordinarily this would be the end. But The Master was part human now, and humans desire to live.The Master's power was destruction. He could break and crush and burn. But breaking is easier than fixing. There are a billion ways for a glass to be broken, but few ways for a glass to be whole. He knitted the linings of Jonathon's stomach together, burned away the acid that spilled into other parts of his body. He fused with intense flames the broken bones and crudely sewed the muscle structure back.None of it worked.\"Why? Why won't you live!?\"It was the brain, he realised. The brain was far more difficult to understand than the rest. It had been cut off from oxygen for too long. It no longer served to send signals to the rest of the body. It was the brain that he had been living inside, but he did not know enough to repair his house. He began to panic. His consciousness was fading.\"NO! No! no...\"With one last cry of desperation, The Master faded from existence.***Richard stood up, dazed, from Jonathon's corpse. As a police officer he had seen his share of corpses. He hadn't killed anyone though. He had said his goodbyes, and he didn't regret killing him. But he felt an overwhelming sadness at the death of someone who could have been a good friend. Who had been, in the end.\"There is no time for mourning. I will take you to my people. We must establish the new order, now that master is dead.\"Richard's vision blurred, and the chaotic scene around him vanished. In its place was a great hall. Thousands of the spirits were whizzing around, busy at work at some unknown task. Along one of the great walls were countless rows of cameras.\"We have been possessing these for many years, sending them out into the world. Some bring misfortune, some bring happiness, a few bring great wealth or terrible destruction. We have been infiltrating this world for many thousands of years, infiltrating your society, shaping your history.\"Richard took the camera from around his neck, the one he had found in the ruins of his house.\"And this one?\"\"I will travel with you around the world, learning what I can. I am The Historian. I long to see your world, to learn about your people. Bring your camera with you. Everything you take pictures of, I will store information about. With my power you will be able to explore places too dangerous for others of your kind.\"\"I've always wanted to travel the world. It's a deal, spirit. By the way, what should I call you?\"\"Just Historian is fine. Names have no meaning to our kind; we can distinguish each other easily without need of them.\"\"I just killed one of your kind. Won't there be some consequence for that?\"\"We do not mourn our dead.\" Then a note of hesitation creeped into his voice \"There was one who followed The Master all the time.

He is not as powerful, and I will be there to protect you.\"\"Shall we travel, then?\"\"Yes. Let's see your world, human.\"***\"I warned him. I told him not to anger the human! And now...now master is dead! Curse that human. Curse that Richard human! How dare he kill my master! I will make him pay. I will have him scream forgiveness to me. I will have him beg for mercy as I strip the flesh from his pathetic human body!\"The lesser spirit - let us call him 'The Avenger' - spent many days planning his revenge upon Richard. He knew he had the protection of another spirit. Knew none of the others exept him cared about The Master's death - that they would elect a new master, one with different aims, without loyalty, without caring or mourning their loss. That was the way of their kind. But Avenger would not rest until Richard was dead. That was his all consuming goal. \"I will slaughter this human. I will tear him apart.\" was all he could think.So he followed after Richard, scheming his demise.***Click. Click. Click.\"I wanted to get a few last pictures of this place. This entire section of the city was quarantined by the government after we left.\"The wasteland stretched for miles. A nuclear bomb had not destroyed New York, but a million small attacks from within.\"You know, nobody will even know what happened to Caitlin or Jonathon. Everyone will just assume they died from the same thing that killed everyone else.\"\"Could we move on? There is nothing more for me to learn from this place.\"\"Huh? You've already been here?\"\"Of course. I was one of the spirits master used to destroy the city.\"\"Wha...you did some of this?\"\"I shifted the emotions of the animals in the city. I made some dogs in the park turn on their master. It was while that old lady was dying that I looked into her mind. She had led such a rich existence.

I will transmit the information into your mind. Come, let us leave these ruins.\"***Richard stood on the train, feeling self conscious. This country was so clean, so organised. The train had arrived to the second, and everyone had left and entered the train in perfect calm orderliness. He was packed pretty tightly with a load of other passengers. Most people seemed to wear full suits, and some people were wearing odd masks for some reason. \"People with colds wear them.

Content: Introduction: Former Governor of Connecticut Jodi Wells was once quoted in saying, \u201cAt the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security.\u201d Security and safety are essentials to living a happy, contented life. When individuals feel insecure, problems ensue. A just government should do all they can to ensure a secure and safe life for their citizens. It is because I believe that the goals politician Jodi Wells mentioned are achievable, I affirm the resolution which asks: \u201cShould governments install surveillance cameras in public places?\u201d To begin, I would like to point out a few terms mentioned in the resolution. Governments: The term implies that the ones in power of the country/state/city/etc. are installing these surveillance devices. As the government in the resolution is not specified as federal, it should not be restricted to such. Surveillance Cameras: Merriam-Webster dictionary defines \"surveillance\" as the act of carefully watching someone or something, especially in order to prevent or detect crime. Cameras are obviously going to be a tool used to achieve surveillance. Thus, these cameras' primary purpose will be used as a form of security. Public places: I will once again use Merriam-Webster dictionary to define this term; exposed to general view. As an area where it is obviously going to be exposed to general view, privacy should not be an issue. With this in mind, let us move on to the remainder of the case. Benefits of Surveillance Outweigh Supposed Harms: Security is inevitably achieved for public places. As brought up by politician Jodi Wells, the goals of the government and for people in general includes security. It is a big problem, and we should be concerned about it. Recently, the city of Baltimore installed over 600 surveillance cameras all around the city. The reasoning behind this is simple. In a study taken by NeighborhoodScout, they found that Baltimore was one of the top 20 (18 to be exact) most dangerous cities in the United States. [1] Danger comes in all forms, but one is generally of more prominence--crime. Surveillance cameras, being their primary purpose, would assist in dealing with crime. With crime running rampant, people cannot feel secure in simply going to a public place. When individuals are in fear, they definitely aren\u2019t secure in the power or ability of their government. These cameras can also prove what actually happened, rather than unreliable \u201ceyewitness\u201d accounts. The majority of the time, these accounts aren\u2019t the whole truth. As law professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA School of Law explains, \u201cPeople are notoriously bad at observing and remembering exactly what happened.\u201d [2] Either one of two things is the result of such fallible memory: 1) they can\u2019t remember exactly what happened, so they tell the closest to accurate tale they can, or 2) they have the liberty to blatantly lie to law enforcement. Neither result is beneficial to achieving justice in whatever matter is at hand. With surveillance cameras strategically positioned in public areas, they can accurately display the chain of events. People will be secure in knowing that judgment that is due will be given, and any harm caused will be adequately dealt with. Surveillance cameras also have benefits in school settings. They allow students to be physically, mentally, and emotionally safe. School shootings are becoming distressing problems, and many people are worried about the safety of their students. Security cameras can allow teachers and school guards (which many schools now have) to monitor any intruder that may approach the campus. If a suspect becomes aggressive, the school can monitor the actions of the attacker to prevent students from being in harms way. If the students can be mentally and emotionally safe, they will be better able to concentrate on their assignments and increase productivity. Privacy is Not a Valid Argument: The resolution explicitly states that it is referring to public places. If an individual is in a public place, it is reasonable to expect exposure to everyone. By going to a public place, every individual temporarily gives up their right to complete privacy. People (in most scenarios) are already allowed to film in public without requiring explicit consent from other individuals. Surveillance cameras only validate that right on a government level. A common argument against this relates to how the government seems \u201cstalkerish\u201d and how they However, the resolution clearly states that it is referring to a public place. Eugene Volokh once again explains, \u201cThese cameras are in public places, where people\u2019s faces and cars are visible to everyone.\u201d People are already going places where ANYONE can see them. That\u2019s more people than would see government surveillance films. Furthermore, the information will only be accessed when needed, not out of leisure or stalking purposes. These surveillance programs simply allow the footage to exist in case a problem needs to be addressed. Even if people think privacy is harmed, the simple fact is that it is not. The security cameras are in public places, and there is always private areas which are not monitored. Problems Remain Unsolved Without Surveillance: Court decisions can only go off of the evidence they have, and from there, their only option would be to trust witness accounts. In practically every case, each witness account contradicts with another in some way, shape, or form. Solvencies for these types of discrepancies are easily discovered by systems of surveillance by the government. Police tickets for running red lights, stop signs, and other traffic related difficulties would be cleared up simply by using surveillance programs. Not only would these unsolved problems be solved, but it would discourage individuals from committing crimes when they feel they have a regulated sense of accountability and punishment for illegal or adverse behavior. There simply is so many benefits and no real arguments as to why we should not have public places under surveillance that the resolution should be affirmed by any just government seeking to protect its citizens.

Content: Thanks, Volkov. 1. Re: With Joe Citizen's ability to record any time, police are going to be subject to biases. I've explained that police being subject to scrutiny is a good thing. As detailed in the last round, police have a tough gig and mistakes will be made; that's the nature of the job. However, because of their rampant authority, being allowed to record their interaction with others can help establish the guilt or innocence of people who may be wrongly abused, arrested or incriminated by law enforcement. Without this protection, our rights are greatly inhibited considering in a court of law their word vs. an ordinary citizen's without evidence is almost *always* upheld; Con did not argue contrary. Without being able to submit tangible evidence, a dirty agent could continue abusing their power and manipulating the system, which can have detrimental effects on the community and an individual's life. As such, this protection far outweighs any negative of people merely scrutinizing the police. Just as some families have chosen to install \"Nanny Cams\" to ensure their child is protected while they're away, people have a right to protect themselves from tyrannical law. Similarly, business owners can install cameras to minimize theft and robbery and protect their property; why can't people do the same to protect theirs (person)? 2. Re: Criminals are using the internet in increasing ways to get around the police If you check out Con's source, it details organized crime personnel in Italy using Skype as a way to avoid being wiretapped. This, of course, has nothing to do with the resolution. Their use of Skype would continue whether or not police were legally able to be recorded. Here, the only evidence Con could possibly present in his favor includes proof that recording POs has had severely detrimental results, or led to criminals tampering with police investigations. Con has not presented evidence of this nature, so we have no reason to assume that recording interaction with a cop would in any way negatively effect police business. Criminals are using technology to get around the police? Sure, it's been happening for ages. What has that got to do with anything? How would recording an officer arrest you, arrest another, or interact with someone in general aid in criminal activity? At best you could argue a direct transmission of data to a criminal, but again that's unlikely and seemingly unuseful. I expect Con to explain how this is possible or likely instead of committing the base rate fallacy (using weak evidence to make a probability judgment without taking into account known empirical statistics about the probability). Again, if I am pulled over, and I record the cop talking to me, asking for my license and registration, etc., how is that harming anything or anyone? Even in a more hostile situation, I don't see how it's relevant. 3. Re: There is no way to keep citizens accountable if they break the law, or jeopardize an officer's safety and ability to keep the peace. It's definitely possible to punish a citizen who abuses this right. If someone is using Skype for criminal activity like in Con's example, then of course they should be punished. Similarly, if someone is using recording police for criminal activity, they should be punished too. However saying because people *might* do this that it's a reason to keep this illegal is absurd. That's like saying alcohol should be illegal because people *might* drink and drive. We've long disposed of that backwards and futile ideology; we know it's better to entrust people with restrictions, and this is one of those cases. Also, this negates Con's own contention. He says it's not fair to record cops because they MIGHT be bad, and then says we shouldn't be able to record because CITIZENS *might* be bad. Not only is this hypocritical, but I've explained how cops being abusive is far more dangerous and likely. 4. Re: POs may not feel safe to act a particular way, which could endanger their lives. Should an officer have \"felt safe\" to open fire on an unarmed man? I advocate that cops feel TOO SAFE to engage in any behavior they please without fear of reprimand. As an example, feverish teasingly told Nags that he would report his father (a cop) to the bureau for tampering with police evidence (a joke). However, Nags responded with something along the lines of, \"What good would that do - reporting my dad to his friends?\" POs should take the liberty to act in accordance with the training they've been given. If someone opens fire on them, they should fire in return. However I doubt any police have been trained to start shooting first, meaning there's no basis to do so. If their shooting (or other actions) was *truly justified,* then they would not be punished (for instance, the cops were found innocent in Sean Bell's case because the jury did not believe the cops were being intentionally harmful). Con writes, \"Adding another pressure to the situation, with cameras rolling, is not necessarily a good idea in an uncontrolled environment.\" Again I negate -- police should feel comfortable knowing that if they do make a mistake, recordings of the going-ons can work in their favor to justify their actions. For instance, if they say they shot someone because they thought he was reaching for a gun, and the video shows the suspect reaching for their wallet, this would indeed be a tragedy but one in which police could be forgiven and understood. However in cases like the examples I've given last round, sometimes police act brutally for completely unjustifiable reasons. These people need to be caught and punished to maintain the integrity of the law. 5. In the last round, I asked Con to explain the \"many regulations\" officers suffer from, as he implied, considering I noted how they usually get away with murder (literally). He pointed out that many officers follow rules, but did not expand any further on this point. 5. On the topic of citizen journalism, Con says that it can be dangerous because of the blatant bias that comes with it. I agree. However, simply recording a police officer does NOT impose any bias. In that case, the actions of the officer and his counterpart speak for themselves. Watching a police officer threaten someone is not bias against the police; it's a representation of the cop's actions. Any distortion to video could easily be noted or proven. 6. Con continues to say that many officers are unjustifiably stigmatized because of the actions of a few, and I agree. However, recording police can be used to prove Con right - that most cops are law abiding and fair. 7. My opponent says that he agrees law enforcement should be held accountable given their authority. However, he writes \"recording technology is [not] an acceptable means of achieving those ends.\" In that case, I invite my opponent to explain why, and more importantly, what a better way of achieving those ends would be considering I've detailed precisely why this is the best and most fair way of ensuring integrity. 8. Con writes, \"If the PO's authority and discretion is so great, would it really make a difference whether [recording] was legal or not?\" Absolutely. If a cop acted wrongly, he'd be held accountable by co-workers and superiors, who would in turn be held accountable by their co-workers and superiors, as well as the public. If Officer Joe was recorded beating an old lady for no reason, and that was posted on YouTube, there would be a public demand for punishment, and this would be an incentive to minimize police abuse. 9. Con concludes by saying that this act could effectively hurt innocent parties. I contend that no sufficient evidence to draw this conclusion has been established, and that this would be a minimal risk. On balance, being allowed to record police would have the most benefits in terms of protecting society and our rights and safety.", "qid": 49, "docid": "9247b1e1-2019-04-18T19:02:31Z-00003-000", "score": 6.920199871063232}, {"content": "Title: Cellphones Should Be Banned In Schools Content: Banning \"disruptive\" things in classrooms has always been a fad of the day for probably as long as humanity has existed. In Ancient Greece, writing in class might be construed as disruptive to the understanding of the material, because remembering by heart might have been seen as better than relying on a piece of written material at the time. In medieval times, the advent of the printing press might have seem threatening to the classroom as well, because people might not need to copy down material on their own, which might be disruptive or bad for learning, some probably argued at the time. At some point, responding to the teacher, asking questions, was probably seen as disruptive as well and not allowed in classrooms. Talking between each other was seen as disruptive in an environment that should be led fully by the teacher at some point, some probably argued, while we encourage group works nowadays. Anyway, these past examples just illustrate how the perceived high problem of disruption of one generation is the next generation's treasure or new way to distill knowledge that might actually be beneficial to everyone. That said, I don't believe for a second that the use of cellphone in classrooms is the next generation's advancement in teaching technology, it remains to be seen, and we are anyway pretty poor at predicting the future. The problem with Pro's resolution is that he proposes the banning in schools, not just in class. i. e. , having a cellphone is perfectly possible when outside the bounds of the school, but when stepping a centimeter inside the boundaries of the school, then it's banned. Furthermore this \"should be banned\" resolution kind of begs the question, banned by whom ? , and how do you enforce or regulate that ban ? Do you propose this to be a federal law that all states and all schools in those states should abide for, and punish the offenders with federal prison ? Should it be a state law, should it be mandatory that each school ban them and punish the offenders however they feel ? Should it be the same ban for all schools or are some schools allowed to band differently ? Considering that cellphones are a now ubiquitous piece of technology, a total ban would need to be enforced in a harsh and unforgiveable way: i. e. mandatory frisking at all school entrances, harsh penalties for having a cellphone inside the school, stuff like that. That's not an environement for good teaching, because the teacher and schools will have to spend a large amount of time policing instead of doing education. Recommending no cellphone use in class and temporarily confiscating offenders' phones if they use it in class, the current situation in most schools, is sufficient policing IMO, anything going above and beyond that would probably involve policing to a degree that is not good.", "qid": 49, "docid": "ef6a56ee-2019-04-18T17:28:44Z-00002-000", "score": 6.919600009918213}, {"content": "Title: Crime cameras help restore a public sense of safety Content: In December, 2008, an armed robbery attempt in New Orleans failed after the victim, according to police, \"...advised the suspect that there were several surveillance cameras in the area,\" and walked safely away from the criminal.[4] The episode suggests that the victim felt that the cameras provided a critical layer of protection against the assailant.

So how could I prove these experiences? It\u2019s not like I have it recorded or anything, but I know that they happened, whether you believe me or not. That\u2019s the point, in a debate personal experience cannot be proven, and as it cannot be proven it isn\u2019t evidence. For all I know you could\u2019ve made this up! But I did not mean that he/she just views them whenever a problem approaches. I meant, that when he/she is in his/her office then they can just see what is going on in every classroom. Do you think that a single principal would be able to concentrate on administrative duties and watch over 20 monitors minimum at the same time? ?? Of course not, either the principal would only be watching the monitors, thus taking away from administrative duties and slowing the entire school down, or will only be doing administrative work, not focusing on the monitors, thus rendering them useless. Another possibility is that the principal occasionally glances at the monitors, but in a 40 minute period there is a very short time frame. There has always been perverted things going on in school, people has had sex In a classroom? I didn\u2019t think so. Oh, and doing drugs does not always have smoke, like actual pills In a classroom? No proof, I don\u2019t think so. This is just like my police analogy (which has remained unrefuted). The reason why teachers are being laid off is because of our idiotic president This is unrelated, whatever the matter, schools do not have the money as teachers are being laid off. Over 132, 000 teachers were laid off in 2011 alone! [1] Most schools have money, so most wouldn\u2019t be a problem. I have disproved this in the above source and argument. Oh, and most schools have cameras in the hallways The fact that schools have cameras in hallways has no bearing in this debate. The hallway and the classroom are very different, in a classroom the teacher is there to supervise, not in the halls. Also, the cameras are not there to catch anything per se, as said in the following source [2] the camera should never make it feel like if a person is attacked that they will be rescued. Thus, their effect in the hallway is minimal as well. Plus, I think it should be only for middle and high school. I\u2019m sorry, but I posted in R1 the definitions as you hadn\u2019t, and the definitions were from grade K \u2013 12, you did not dispute this so it was accepted as the definition. Thus, this point (which is really just your opinion) is null. Bringing up definitions, we have focused this debate on junior and high school, yet what about elementary schools? Does my esteemed opponent think that perverted acts and drugs will occur in an elementary school? ? Clearly, the implementation of a camera system in elementary schools is a massive incursion of privacy and a massive waste of money. I beg my opponent to address this point in his final round.

Neither side should be ASSUMED malicious without evidence. By remaining neutral, CON suggests I have taken sides. \"The same (amount of destroyed equipment) - this cannot be proven\" Speaking about the incident of the two damaged cameras, one of which was damaged by an officer, the other by the crowd. \"Protesters have not been firing gas rounds into residential backyards... A red herring\" This has nothing to do with media suppression, the story being discussed, and wasn't brought up until the final round. SUSPENSIONS \"(Suspensions began) only following international outrage and days of abuses.\" http://www.aa.com.tr... Nothing about the media putting pressure on the department for a suspension. The department representative confirmed the officer's suspension had already been carried out. \"Only a small number of officers have been suspended.\" Only a small number have committed acts that require suspension.

Somebody's going to get hurt. We don't want to see you guys get hurt.\" The KSDK crew says that is the voice of a police officer.\" CON provided a transcript directly supporting my point that the officers made no attempt to harass, threaten, or steal from the journalists to prevent exposure of their supposed crimes, only to get them down the street to their vehicle. ARRESTS \"A police officer forcefully removed a Vice News Journalist's press badge and screamed that \"this doesn't mean $hit!\"\" There's no new evidence allowed, but: Just like the 4 that have been suspended, his actions were unreasonable and should be brought up the ranks. \"The detainment of media is an unconstitutional violation of their first amendment rights, and causes suppression.\" You misunderstand the constitution if you think temporary detainment is a violation of it, and journalists are given no special distinction based on the 1st amendment. \"The large number of abuses indicate they are not isolated\" In summary of our covered \"abuses\" they are few and far between considering the sheer number of interactions between officers and citizens. \"Pro arbitrarily would like to dismiss this damning evidence (threat to protestor) which cannot be refuted.\" This topic was clearly defined to discuss the media being suppressed by law enforcement. A civilian being threatened by an officer (immediately relieved of duty) has no bearing on this. \"Dozens (of journalists), including protesters.\" CON attempts to inflate the number of supporting cases by suggesting that anyone on the streets of Ferguson should be considered \"media\" \"The articles linked in each (story) state no paperwork was issued. (And) the muckrock link further proves no records were taken, as arrest reports are made public immediately.\" Arrest reports are NOT made public immediately, and in a town that doesn't even have cameras in their patrol vehicles it's probably an even slower process. This source is an open request for documents, and a response explaining when to expect said paperwork from the county. CON has already concluded without evidence that these documents will not be provided in the future. \"(Cpt. Johnson) caught on a vine ordering the detention of two journalists.\" The media is not exempt from following lawful orders, and a brief detainment isn't unlawful. They were detained for less than 10 minutes and offered an apology. http://talkingpointsmemo.com...

The FBI was getting involved either way, so the law enforcement element had no reason to suppress the media, at least in an attempt to prevent FBI involvement. The one counterargument by CON was that: \"The FBI investigation was due to outrage over media suppression\" A claim of which is overtly false. \"Pro claims the media is dishonest\" I've made no claims of the media being dishonest. \"Pro makes a semantics argument focusing on my use of the word \"several\" another Red Herring.\" I pointed it out for the continued inconsistency in CON's statements. The claim \"the media is being suppressed by law enforcement in Ferguson\" is a statement that implies that the whole, or the majority, or even a large enough portion of various departments are actively seeking to control the media. CON was unable to explain why this was happening, as the media isn't revealing any revelations about Ferguson the police were hiding, and the police force doesn't seem concerned with changing viewer's minds in any sense of \"propaganda\". CON uses isolated incidents and plays on words to suggest that all citizens are media, and any slight infringement upon a citizen, regardless of lawfulness, is an intentional violation of the 1st amendment to prevent the \"truth\" from spreading. CON gives erroneous accounts of property being stolen by police, when they can be clearly seen intact on video. CON let many of my points stand by dismissing them as fallacy.

Privacy -the state or condition of being free from being observed or disturbed by other people.Valued - prioritized or put above, as my adversary defines itSecurity - the state of being free from danger or threat.Combine those sentences , and we can see what we are discussingThe state of being free from or disrupted by other people should be prioritized or put above the state of being free from danger. Right off the start, that should already bring up red flags. Rebuttal 1\" I just cant t seem to understand how if someones home privacy would be of threat to national security. If there was evidence that they were a terrorist, then of course the police would be able to intervene. But the EVIDENCE has to exist, and if probable cause was there, then it is no longer a matter of privacy vs. security, it becomes a matter of justice being served.\"It doesn't have to be terrorism in itself. The ability the government has to tap our phones, or even through satellite surveillance can help them stop crimes from happening. That is essentially an invasion of privacy, but thanks to modern technology it helps prevent some major crimes from happening. Just take surveillance cameras and all the crimes they prevent. This is considered an invasion of privacy, but it is also a severe deterrent for crime in itself.A recent study says this\"Surveillance cameras have a great potential to reduce and act as a deterrent for crime. In locations where they have been installed, attempts at robbery have dropped nearly 65 percent in some cases\"That is just with cameras not to mention how randomly doing checks of cars, can help prevent and catch criminals as well. http://www.washingtontimes.com...http://www.usatoday.com...http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com...Rebuttal 2\"Police will still be empowered with those powers, its the personal privacy of people who are innocent that we need to protect; innocent people who are having their phone calls monitored, their search history checked, their personal lives invaded for no reason at all\"That is all in perception, if they had suspicion that something was wrong and wanted to get a warrant that would be invading their privacy. It is a slippery slope when you say privacy should be valued over security because then it begs, when is it plausible to breach the privacy. You say when there are facts, or you possibly meant to say when it is a neccessity. If the government is to define what is a neccessity, then the argument is counter productive. If you were to value this over security, it could and would be abused in multiple situatons. Rebuttal 3\"Another excellent example that demonstrates how security measures are getting out of hand \"\"Strangely, Contention has said that without a balance, the government would have too much authority, and I absolutely agree with this. Privacy needs to be valued over security and ONLY if this is done, will discrimination at discretion and abuse of power end. If we do not put privacy first, then we put too much power in the hands of law enforcers\"This is where I state that it should work together, and one should not be valued over the other. It works both ways, and both could be exploited. My adversary clearly wants to say that privacy should always come first, and I submit there are cases that have, can, and will happen that will prevent it from being prioritized. That does not mean they both can not be equally valued. I gave an example also what happens when a company has to much privacy, this is proven and shown with Enron. While it may be less likely in home scenarios it is still plausible, but the main situation where it would be exploited would be giving a company to much privacy. It is almost a requirement to breach their privacy. If you look at it by the definitions we are discussing, external auditing is a breach of that companies privacy. It is allowing an outside person access to files and records, with no plausible reason or desire from that company. This is necessary however to prevent scandals like Enron from occurring. In this situation it is a breach of that companies privacy and right to privacy, but also a necessity. Therefore you have both privacy and security working together in a reasonable and acceptable way. Rebuttal 4We\u2019re not given these rights just so that lazy and ignorant governments can then steal it away from usI would also contest that there is no where in the constitution that even mentioned or says the word privacy. We are afforded this right because of the context within the Constitution itself. It is a way for us to be free without repression. Privacy is considered to fall under those rights that are promised to us. No where in the constitution does it state that we have the right to privacy but we can use inference to assume privacy should be allotted to us. I have also agreed that giving the government to much control is a bad thing as well, which is why I still hold to the fact that they can work together. Examples such as cameras and random audit checks demonstrates that they can.In closingWhile con has chose not to address or could not address many statements that I have made, we can conclude that there are situations in which security should be valued over privacy. Also that there are cases where privacy should be valued over security. to shift the burden in one direction, is to lead to drastic abuse of the system in either way. I have shown and demonstrated how these two factors can plausibly work together, and offer benefit and progression in a positive way.I believe we are afforded the right to privacy and that should be upheld, but we are also promised the right to be free. Without cherishing security as well as privacy, we risk that freedom.", "qid": 49, "docid": "f3b8e0ea-2019-04-18T17:13:30Z-00000-000", "score": 6.809599876403809}, {"content": "Title: Traffic light cameras Content: Yes, it IS on like Donkey Kong!!!

Next, I would think it is cheaper for them to use the cameras than to beef up police patrols for red lights, so in the end it is more cost effective for tax-payers.

So if they have to make a little cash off people running red lights, rather than raise taxes or cut important programs, then I say go for it! And I find the cameras make things safer.

CP Counterplan: The US will provide a basic income, excluding felons, violent criminals, FBI watchlist members and legal immigrants who have lived in the US for less than 10 years. Through the CP, the neg solves for all the aff impacts of economic equality, gender equality, drug abuse, health care, and education. However the CP isn't advocating for universal basic income, as according to my opponent and common definitions of the term, UBI is both universal and unconditional. UBI shouldn't have any restrictions or bounds on who receives a basic income; otherwise it wouldn't be universal and cease to be a UBI. Framework I agree with my opponent's standard of the Kantian Social Contract, however, this is better upheld under the negation as I'm aren't supporting mass immigration nor crime. Instead of the principle of generic consistency, rather we should determine ethical actions through the basis of consequentialism. Overall, I solve all the aff impacts, and I better support his framework. Observations I fulfill my opponent's observations as he says I must prove a basic income wouldn't help the common american, while the resolution is based on universal basic income. Instead he must prove how UBI would better support the average american compared to merely a basic income. Contention 1: Crime and Terror Under the CP, basic income isn't supplied towards violent criminals and felons. Imagine a world where criminals such as those in the Crips, Bloods, MS-13, Latin Kings, Mexican Mafia, Sinaloa Drug Cartel, Barrio Azteca, or the Surenos, had, just for the sake of argument, $10,000 for every member annually. Just for a smaller group like Tango Blast, which boasts 19,000 members, the US money would indirectly give the organization through its members $190,000,000 dollars annually, for whatever means they so wish. The impact is an increase in overall crime, especially in the case of transnational organized crime groups. What could occur if say a known terrorist organization It could very well be said that if criminals have funds given to them? In the case of domestic shootings, terrorists could buy larger and larger weaponry, with the potential of gaining military hardware through the black market. Imagine the outcome of say, the Orlando Massacre if Mateen had say an M-16, grenades, or such. Contention 2: Welfare Magnets As aforementioned, UBI has to provided towards everyone regardlessly. If such a welfare state was created, where just by existing people can get a basic income, it would decisively be regarded as utopian in nature. Anyone and everyone would wish to go there. Mass immigration would soon occur, as everyone attempts to join the welfare state. Much like how many immigrants in the status quo receive food stamps through their naturalized children, a similar phenomenon would occur with UBI.

Content: For clarity I will be presenting my arguments on why we should not implement a UBI and then moving on to addressing my opponents point. With that out of the way I will move onto my arguments Contention 1: A universal basic income will not work. The New York Times(1) says that $1,000 a month to every American would cost around 3 trillion dollars a year. And $1,000 is a month is below the poverty line. 3 trillion dollars a year is almost the entire US budget and more than twice our discretionary funding. So we can see that A UBI is not feasible at all. Contention 2: A UBI would bring about a dystopian future. Imagine if you will a world where jobs are few and far between, those with jobs are locked in a competitive industry with few workers rights. The government is a tyrranical mess where the rights of the people are nothing.What I am saying is not some impossible nightmare, and as I will show you it is very possible. Subpoint A - Loss of jobs. Fox Business(2) says that because of increased automation, 22.7 million jobs will disappear by 2025. And CNBC(3) says that only with proper adaptability and commitment will the workforce ascend to the next level of work. Now what that means is that only with proper commitment by workers can we at least help to avoid rampant unemployment. And this is where UBIs comes in. According to the Foundation for Economic Education(4) giving handouts to every American would de-incentivize them to try and find a job. So as we can see a UBI will aid in a drastic rise in unemployment. In addition it will take away money and focus from useful systems such as a jobs guarantee which would solve the imminent unemployment at a much lower cost. According to The Atlantic(5) it would only cost 158 billion dollars a year, less than a 15th of the cost of a UBI program. So as we can see a UBI will exacerbate job loss and harm us greatly. Subpoint B - Loss of rights. According to Sapira(6) political rights are directly correlated with economic participation. She says \"And this is the real danger of a universal basic income it makes the citizens unnecessary to the government\" She also says that in societies where the state economy comes from sources that require only a small, fixed number of people to defend or maintain them, tend to develop autocratic regimes with little concern for the welfare of their citizens. To summarize, a universal basic income is a frivolous, expensive system that will cause a loss of our jobs and our political rights. Now I will respond to my opponents arguments. Entrepreneurship: In this argument my opponent presents that entrepreneurship will increase because people will have financial security. Now I have three responses to this. First, there seems to be a lot of different evidence tied together here. My opponent talks about the effects of entrepreneurship in India and Namibia, and talks about the danger of low economic security. But I would like to see the evidence that states that a UBI will fix this, and why. Secondly, There are more effective ways to do this. For instance a negative income tax, which I will talk more about later as my opponent mentions it, could remove financial insecurity. Which would in turn raise entrepreneurial spirit. Finally, this won't matter because we cannot pay for a UBI. Education/ College(I am combining my opponents second and third points because they deal with the same thing.): For these arguments my opponent presents that a UBI will decrease highschool dropouts and increase college and thus innovation. My responses to my opponents previous arguments apply here as well. I would like to see evidence specifically stating this and a negative income tax could do these things as well. And of course we just can't pay for it. Lower Work Hours: My opponent begins this argument by talking about benefits of lower work hours and then continues on to say that A UBI will lower work hours. But the crux here is that their evidence is about negative income tax not universal basic income. A negative income tax is very different from a universal basic income. Samuel Hammond and the Niskanen Center(7) published an article titled \"Universal Basic Income is just Negative Income tax with a Leaky Bucket.\" And in this article they explain what negative income tax is \"The NIT, popularized by Milton Friedman, is an extension of the progressive tax system into negative territory. Just as someone making lots of money pays a higher tax rate, those below the poverty line would pay an increasingly negative tax rate\"which is to say, the IRS would pay them.\" Now this is obviously not universal, and is not an income. So really my opponent has no evidence that supports their claim that a UBI will reduce global warming. Economic Inequality: So here my opponent talks about how a UBI will reduce income inequality. But their evidence talks about raising people out of poverty. Now this is different because the rich will also get payed more, meaning the gap will stay the same. Systems that would go towards reducing income inequality do exists though. Systems like a jobs guarantee or negative income tax would do this, however these are not we are debating the merits of. So it's clear, A UBI will, cost too much, take away our jobs, take away our freedom, and it's benefits can be better accomplished with other systems. This means that it is flawed and unnecessary. For these reasons I strongly urge a con vote.

Thanks to Pro for instigating the challenge.DefinitionsProsperity. Prosperity is measured by the average annual income of the members of a society. For societies that rely mainly by subsistence agriculture and barter, Calculations of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) [1. http://en.wikipedia.org...], measured by monetary transactions, divided by population will not accurately reflect the relative wealth of the community. In any society, not all of GDP is reflected in individual income. I doubt that either issue will be important in the debate, but they might arise. For our purposes GDP per capita will be a suitable measure of prosperity.Distributions of wealth. Perfect equality would be everyone in society having exactly the same income. As a graph of numbers of people versus income distribution, in a perfectly equal society all the people would appear on the graph at a single spike at one income level. While there is only one way for everyone to be equal, there are many ways that wealth may be unequally distributed. If the factors leading to some quantity occur randomly multiply, the result will be a log-normal distribution. [2. http://en.wikipedia.org...] The distribution of the sizes of trees in a forest, IQ scores, the sex drive of humans, he sizes of cities, and a host of other natural phenomena are well described by the log normal distribution. So if a forest grows undisturbed, the trees will nave a log normal distribution of sizes. A farmer growing oranges will trim the trees to uniform size, artificially producing equality.I know this statistical talk is inherently very nasty, but I doubt there is any way to avoid it. Poverty level. We will need a definition of \"poverty level.\" This is somewhat controversial of late, because the U.S. government has introduced a new definition of poverty in terms of equality. For this debate, I want to use the definition: The level of income in a society at which the basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter are met. The income level at which basic needs are met varies with the society. In the U.S., it is a family income of about $30,000 a year. $30,000 per year in underdeveloped countries would correspond to substantial wealth. It varies substantially within the US. In rural areas, $30,000 allows a better lifestyle than in expensive urban areas.I have no objection to using other definitions of poverty level in the debate, but I ask alternatives be distinguished by some additional word added to the phrase poverty level. Again I don't think we need an extremely precise definition. I will be arguing that the economic goal of society should be to raise as many people as possible above the poverty level, meaning that we should want as many people as possible to have their basic needs met. I think we can argue that without getting into a discussion as to whether for a particular society \"basic needs\" includes a cell phone or not.Happiness. I will need a definition of happiness. Fortunately, the idea of happiness is universal. There are actually measures of levels of happiness in societies. The important think is that the measures all depend upon self-assessment. The principle is that if you think you are happy or unhappy, there is no better authority for the opinion. The Wikipedia article on happiness economics gives an overview of the subject. [3. http://en.wikipedia.org...] The Satisfaction with Life Index is, I think, a pretty good measure. [4. http://en.wikipedia.org...]. United Nations Human Development Index is empirical, but it seems reasonable. [5. http://www.cnngo.com...] the two generally follow each other in broad outline. Pro's definitionsPro is right when he says that economic equality is about standard of living, but he's wrong in asserting that employers being fair has anything to do with that. People may be economically equal or unequal largely independent of employment. For example, The Prince of Monaco provides free housing to all citizens, and that has nothing to do with employer fairness. Subsistence agriculture has a high degree of equality with everyone self employed. \"Fairness\" is completely subjective. What Pro or the government thinks is fair may be completely at odds with other concepts of fairness. I have heard the argument that it is unfair to discriminate on grounds of competence.Pro also claims government must do all it can to fight unemployment. That's not a measure of equality. Again, rich princes may provide a large amount equalization without concern for employment. I agree that unemployment is a concern in economic policy, but that concern arises in my case and Pro's case. It's not part of the definition. A significant minimum wage always increases unemployment, but whether that is good or bad overall is a matter to be argued.If equality is the primary goal of economic policy, it can always be achieved through universal poverty. The question is about the priorities of policy. What's more important?On to Pro's case.", "qid": 50, "docid": "3cd3a05e-2019-04-18T18:23:14Z-00006-000", "score": 9.784600257873535}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income is a good thing Content: Let's debate the merit, feasibility, And necessity of a Universal Basic Income. Heads up - this first post is quite long. My future arguments will be more succinct. It's a big topic so I'm looking for an opponent who's willing to put some time into this debate. ---A Universal Basic Income: is a periodic, Unconditional, Automatic, Guaranteed payment given to all citizens; regardless of their income. Universal basic income is one of the most ambitious social policies of our time. Over 15 countries are currently running UBI feasibility trials [1]. Why is it that so many scientists, Politicians, And economists are spending their time researching this wacky-sounding idea? The key benefits of a Universal Basic Income are as follows: A UBI would completely eliminate poverty A UBI might pay for itself by creating a massive economic boost A UBI encourages people to work, Unlike welfare A UBI reduces bureaucracy A UBI makes the population smarter and healthier A UBI reduces crime rates --- It's not all altruism though. A UBI also addresses a dangerous threat to our world: The job insecurity created by automation. Job creation can't keep up with automation. While it's true that innovation creates new jobs, These don't compare with the number of jobs being eliminated by the same technological advancements. Automation has been blamed as the key reason why factory workers and miners are losing jobs. Job growth is tied down by corporate structures and politics. Technology doesn't care. As technology advances it makes things more efficient. This efficiency means employers can produce more stuff with less workforce. In a world where artificial intelligence can diagnose better than doctors, Compose classical music, Beat professional players at starcraft, Poker and go, People are worried that the pace of job growth will not be able to keep up with the advancement of technology. Take the self-driving car for example; Transportation is one of the largest industries in the world. Imagine the jobs lost and economic catastrophe if this industry became fully automated. This might not be long off; self-driving cars have already shown to be at least as good, If not better drivers than humans. ---A UBI would completely eliminate povertyBy providing all citizens with a basic living income we could end homelessness, Hunger and poverty overnight. A UBI could pay for itself by creating a massive economic boost In a recent study, A UBI of $1000/month in the USA was estimated to grow the GDP by over 12. 5% in 8 years [2]. Allowing poor people to spend more will increase overall economic demand. More people buying things means more tax revenue is generated and a stronger economy. This would offset the long-term cost of the program. A UBI encourages people to workThe modern welfare disincentives people from getting jobs, Unemployment insurance and welfare cheques disappear when you get a job. UBI doesn't discourage jobs, Because people get to keep the money either way. Studies show that while some people initially quit their jobs, They often use the freedom UBI provides to find jobs that they are better suited for (increasing productivity), Going back to school, Or taking care of their family. A UBI reduces bureaucracy and paperworkModern welfare systems are immensely complex. The UBI is simple. It doesn't require income verification, Tax departments, Eligibility checks, Identity checks, Or any other bureaucratic labor. A UBI makes the population healthierBy providing everyone with the means for basic shelter and nutrition, We can reduce (the currently overwhelming) strain on most health care systems. With increased economic security, People are less prone to stresses, Disease, And self-destructive behavior. A UBI experiment in Canada saw hospitalization rates go down 8. 5%[3]A UBI makes the population smarterStudies have shown that the stress of poverty makes people much worse decision makers. The effect is not subtle, This study showed it was equal in a 13 point drop in IQ[4]. By eliminating the distress of millions we can create a smarter more rational society. A UBI reduces crime ratesThe root cause of crime is desperation. Desperate people take desperate measures and are more likely to break laws. By lifting society out of poverty we would greatly reduce desperation thus removing one of crimes biggest motivators. This has the potential to greatly reduce crime rates everywhere. ---A universal basic income is not only good for society and the economy; it may also be the only realistic solution to the near-term threat of automation.", "qid": 50, "docid": "12cc98d3-2019-04-18T11:08:03Z-00002-000", "score": 9.766799926757812}, {"content": "Title: Resolved: The US ought to provide a UBI Content: Ok, I understand that I will not do my last speech then, for round 4, correct? Well, I will just assume so. Anyways, moving on...(and all sources will be in round 4 speech) I stand in firm affirmation of the Resolved: The United States Ought to Provide a Universal Basic Income Observation 1: Definition Basic income has 5 characteristics... A basic income is a periodic cash payment unconditionally delivered to all on an individual basis, without means-test or work requirement. That is, basic income has the following five characteristics: Periodic: it is paid at regular intervals (for example every month), not as a one-off grant. Cash payment: it is paid in an appropriate medium of exchange, allowing those who receive it to decide what they spend it on. It is not, therefore, paid either in kind (such as food or services) or in vouchers dedicated to a specific use, as well as any form of benefit (such as disability or food stamp). Individual: it is paid on an individual basis\"and not, for instance, to households. Universal: it is paid to all, without means test. Unconditional: it is paid without a requirement to work or to demonstrate willingness-to-work Observation 2: Grounds The negative must prove that Basic Income does NOT benefit the citizens of the US, as well as prove that the US ought not to provide a basic income, instead of the countries ability to do so, as the resolution states ought. Framework: My Standard for evaluating morality for this round is upholding the Kantian Social Contract due to the principle of generic consistency. We can\"t know what others want [Kant, 1] Since people differ in their thinking about happiness and how each would have it constituted, their wills with respect to it cannot be brought under any common principle and so under any external law harmonizing with everyone's freedom. [Kant, 2]No one can coerce me to be happy in his way. Instead, each may seek his happiness in the way that seems good to him, provided he does not infringe upon this right of another.We, as humans, don\"t know what other people want in their pursuit of life. Therefore, laws that promote a certain type of happiness violate the individual\"s individuality. Since all people are inherently rational beings, this violates their rights as beings and is against a-priori reasoning. Society in decisions [Kant, 3] For what is under discussion here is not the happiness that a subject may expect from the institution or administration of a commonwealth but above all merely the right that is to be secured for each by means of it, which is the supreme principle for which all maxims having to do with a commonwealth must proceed and which is limited by no other principle. The \"public well-being' that must be taken into account is lawful constitution which secures everyone his freedom by laws, whereby each remains at liberty to seek his happiness in whatever way seems best to him. What Kant is saying is that societies govern to secure each person the right to achieve happiness and self-fulfillment. Therefore, to infringe upon someone\"s rights is to deny that person their right to happiness. Since this is only violating the rights of one person, it is a violation of the goals of a state \" and by extension of society. Contention 1: UBI Promotes Freedom 1. UBI Means Freedom to Pursue What One Wants (1) The objective of basic income is to transform the deprivations linked to non-employment and poorly remunerated employment into \"real freedom\" (1995). Real freedom requires not just the abstract right but financial resources to make freedom a lived reality. Furthermore, by securing individuals\" \"power to say no\", basic income reduces the vulnerability of poor and working people to exploitative relations in labor markets. And, According to Rutger Bregman, (2) UBI would allow both our employment and leisure time to become more fulfilling. Currently, millions of people are employed in work that serves no real purpose, and is simply a way to fill time and provide salaries. Under UBI, Bregman believes we would have the financial freedom to pursue useful and worthwhile work. 2. UBI Creates Economic Freedom Among Citizens Jason Murphy states that\" There has also been a growing focus on how basic income could be implemented to address gender inequality. He points to a rape shelter in Vancouver that has voiced support for UBI, in part because it would give women the economic freedom to escape abusive relationships. Murphy also stated that\" A monthly stipend and reduced working hours would give both parents the freedom to commit to domestic chores, while still being able to invest in professional careers. Women carry the burden of emotional labor\"the childcare, support, and household work, which largely goes uncompensated. According to Bregman, \"This unpaid work is valuable and\"UBI is recognition of that.\" Contention 2: Poverty Internal Link Basic Income Eliminates Poverty (3) The human rights case for a basic income: Poverty is not a natural tragedy like cancer or earthquakes. Poverty is a human caused tragedy like slavery or government oppression. These types of tragedies can be ended by recognizing that humans have the right not to be subjected to tortuous conditions imposed by other. And humans have a right not to live in poverty. A basic income is not a strategy for dealing with poverty; it it the elimination of poverty. The campaign for a basic income is a campaign for the abolition of poverty. 1. Drug Abuse (4) It seems sort of obvious that bad times might result in more drug abuse, as people suffering from economic despair self-medicate. Researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of Colorado Denver published a paper showing an undeniable inverse relationship between drug abuse and the economy overall. According the data, when one sinks, the other rises. \"There is strong evidence that economic downturns lead to increases in substance use disorders involving hallucinogens and prescription pain relievers\"\" Drug treatment policies get significantly cut during economic downturns, which seems like precisely the wrong move at the wrong time. In short, increased rates of income leads to a decrease in drug use, and moreover abuse. More deaths, illnesses and disabilities stem from substance abuse than from any other preventable health condition. Any chance to decrease drug abuse should be taken to value the lives and welfare of humanity. 2. Healthcare (5) For most people, a single doctor\"s visit can be a financial obstacle course. Many patients throughout the year pay hundreds or thousands of dollars in premiums. Then, at the doctor\"s office, they are faced with a deductible, and they may need to pay coinsurance or make a copayment. If they have prescriptions, they\"ll likely fork over cash for those, too. And that\"s just for basic primary care for one person. Repeat that process for an entire family; add in any labs, referrals, specialists, emergency-room visits, and surgeries; and the result for even healthy families is dozens and dozens of payments, and often thousands of dollars. If the UBI were to be implemented in the U.S., people would have to worry less about the expensive payments that must be made because of illness or injury. If people\"s income increased, they could purchase more healthcare. Less disease and injuries leads to less widespread death and harm. 3. Education (6) UBI keeps kids enrolled in schools. By providing an income cushion, it would increase workers\" bargaining power, potentially driving up wages. It would make it easier for people to take risks with their job choices, and to invest in education. In the U.S. in the seventies, there were small-scale experiments with basic-income guarantees, and they showed that young people with a basic income were more likely to stay in school; in New Jersey, kids\" chances of graduating from high school increased by twenty-five per cent I stand in firm affirmation.", "qid": 50, "docid": "ffdf2e2e-2019-04-18T11:43:09Z-00006-000", "score": 9.64330005645752}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income Content: A Universal Basic Income: is a periodic, Unconditional, Automatic, Guaranteed payment given to all citizens; regardless of their income.

An idea that mediocrity should be good enough for everyone. I challenge my opponent to explain why someone whose idea of happiness is financial success or even endless wealth, is somehow immoral. What pedestal does my opponent get to stand on to claim that wealth is not a valid form of happiness, or ones pursuit of wealth somehow adversely affects everyone else? As long as those endeavors are done by legal means, then those pursuits do not affect others! It seems to me the United States has been trying to provide a universal basic income since the great depression, mostly by means of a minimum wage. Not to suggest that the minimum wage is the only factor that causes prices to rise, but it is the most effective factor to cause prices to rise. When the minimum wage goes up, then the cost of production goes up which then is past on to the consumer. I challenge my opponent to explain how causing prices to go up is an effective tool for helping those with lesser incomes. Furthermore, minimum wages can cause employers to have to forego hiring new employees. When the cost of production goes up, it causes business owners to go elsewhere for production. In the end, raising minimum wages only proves to make American workers less competitive on a global scale which causes jobs to disappear. I fail to see how stifling job growth is good for anybody. Many point to the industrial revolution as if it was a sad period for the American worker and point out the disproportionate nature of wealth distribution, yet they conveniently forget that it was an unprecedented achievement that took place. At no other point in written history has so many people been brought out of poverty so quickly. There were no minimum wages, so prices were low and so was the cost of living. Right now, China is on an industrious endeavor that could prove to dwarf the achievements of the industrial revolution. When production is left alone, it can prove to be very effective in bringing wealth to the masses. I noticed this is my opponents first debate on this site.

Throughout the debate I am basing my assertions about universal health care plans on Hillary Clinton's plan; as she is the Democratic front-runner (and Obama's is very similar) it is a good platform for what is actually being proposed. What she proposes, in brief, is this: 1. If you have health insurance now, keep it. 2. If you do not, you can: - buy private insurance direct from an insurer - buy private insurance through the government (like what Congress gets) - apply for a subsidized plan. These will be given need-based. 3. Everyone must have health insurance, and all plans must meet certain standards. \"My first point, being that there isn't a single government agency or division that runs efficiently; do we really want an organization that developed the U.S. Tax Code handling something as complex as health care?\" It is easy to find examples of any system that does not run well. In fact, publicly funded health care would sidestep this problem by having the government do needs-based subsidizing for lower-income families. In terms of universal health care, Germany is a good example of what happens when it works right, and they spend much less of their GDP per capita on health care than we do. \"My second point deals with how if we go through with public health care, it will become premanent just like social security turned out to be.\" It is meant to be permanent, as was Social Security. This is a bit of a non-issue. \"And now my third and final point states that patients aren't likely to curb their drug costs and doctor visits if health care is free; thus, total costs will be several times what they are now.\" The subsidized private plans that lower-income families will be purchasing will cover doctor's visits, of course - just like every other private health insurance plan that is worth its salt. \"In closing, by establishing free and universal health-care, we will drastically hurt our economy, everything our nation stands for, and it may also harm our actual health, doing the exact opposite thing it tried to do. Thank you.\" You have failed to prove any of these. And now, for my points. 1. No industrialized nation except for us lacks some sort of universal health care system. It's a basic right. We are the richest nation in the world, and yet 47 million of us lack any health care. 2. No industrialized nation in the world spends more of its GDP per capita on health care than we do. If socialized medicine is so expensive, than why does the rest of the world spend less? Because hospitals transfer the free emergency room costs onto the medicare plans, because medicare cannot negotiate its drug or hospital costs. With a mandate for health care, there will be fewer costs at the hospital level, because everyone will have health insurance. Period. 3. This is not socialized medicine. A true socialist model is single-payer government, this is blatantly not. This is basic subsidization for those in greatest need. Everyone should be able to have access to quality health insurance.", "qid": 50, "docid": "a48081b0-2019-04-18T19:55:32Z-00002-000", "score": 9.257499694824219}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income Content: IntroductionAn unconditional, individual, and universal basic income would indisputably boost the economy and allow many low-income Americans to climb the ladder of social mobility. It would not only lift people above the poverty line and reduce income inequality, but create jobs, lower school dropout rates, improve health, and raise overall economic output. A UBI would enable, rather than trap, those with unfortunate financial situations as it would provide *everyone* money to work with; all would have the fiscal leverage to progress forward when they otherwise wouldn\u2019t.Our current welfare programs, in contrast, do the opposite of what they\u2019re intended for. They encourage passive behavior and inhibit productivity. The means-tested programs withdraw benefits as soon as a certain income is reached, and are burdened with high marginal tax rates so long as their income is below a certain level. Others require people to exhaust nearly all their assets until they become eligible for aid. With so many strings attached, and the overall counter-productive nature, welfare programs simply are inferior to a UBI, and have too many downfalls.Economic/Societal ImpactsThere are several instances of cash transfers, or UBI trials, working. The following examples turn up multiple benefits:Namibia tried out a UBI program, the Basic Income Grant, in 2007-2012. After just one year into the program, household poverty rates dropped from 76% to 37%. Other effects were noted too: income-generating activities rose from 44% to 55% over the time period. Parents were enabled to purchase school uniforms, afford school fees, and encourage attendance because of this problem, and as a result, school dropout rates dropped from 40% to nearly 0% in a year [2].India tried a cash transfer project from 2013-2014 too. The result was that sanitation improved, medicine could be afforded, clean water became more accessible, and participants could eat more regularly [3].Uganda\u2019s UBI trial enabled participants to invest in skill training. The findings were that \u201crelative to the control group, the program increases business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%\u201d [4]. Kenya has an ongoing trial, and it has so far reportedly let to increased happiness and life satisfaction, and reduced depression and stress [5].If we are to quantify the effect this would have in the US, we should look at the current poverty levels. Currently, the poverty level is a $12,140 income for individuals [1]. With my proposed UBI of $10,000, this would pull everyone with an income of a few thousand or more above the line. That\u2019s potentially *millions* of people. The Failure of Welfare ProgramsThe current welfare programs do *not* provide overall work incentives. Most are means-tested, meaning that if you demonstrate that your income and capital are below specified limits, you\u2019re eligible. This can lead to what some call the \u201ccliff effect\u201d: once someone passes an income threshold, that aid is withdrawn, and climbing further up the income ladder becomes more difficult. This issue is maximized when we understand how disadvantaged the poor are tax-wise under welfare. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, \u201c[found] that the marginal tax rate climbs to 40 percent when a worker earns slightly more than about $12,000, and then to nearly 50 percent in the mid-$20,000 range.\u201d [6] These programs impose high marginal tax rates, essentially trapping these recipients into a large income hole that they can\u2019t climb out of. To put this into better perspective, here\u2019s a graph [7] that shows tax-less income in respect to income earned: These welfare programs are creating a clear poverty trap. Under a universal basic income, this wouldn\u2019t happen. A UBI would extend to *every* person, regardless of what their incomes are, enabling them to have more social mobility than they would under the incredibly flawed welfare programs that are burdening so many lower-income people.But that\u2019s not all. Many welfare programs also have asset limits, meaning that one must have almost no assets to be eligible for benefits. Programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) have asset limit ranges from $1,000 in states like Georgia and Texas to $10,000 in Delaware [8]. This is problematic because it discourages the importance of saving and self-reliance; only those who exhaust just about all of their assets become eligible for aid. Savings are very important because they provide cushion against anything that goes wrong. Just having under $2,000, for instance, is enough to protect against eviction, missed meals, or the loss of utilities during a financial setback. To force such recipients to go to the point of being broke to receive benefits in no way incentivizes them to increase their income.To sum, a UBI would (1) significantly reduce poverty and boost economic output, and (2) incentivize people to work in ways our current welfare programs cannot.

I admit that indeed the Mincome study had to take that into account. ************************************************************************************************************ Your quote: \"Objection : What does prevent the employers from adjusting wage rates in order to discharge costs on the state. Ex : Mincome is set at 1000$ per month. Mr. Mario who works as an apprentice plumber earns 1000$ per month and therefore nothing is added to his income Mr. Luigi who works as a pizzaiolo earns 700$ per month. Mincome will provide him with the extra 300$ What would happen if Mr. Mario employer decided to cut his salary to 700$ (or hire new personnel at 700$) ? The state would have to set minimum wages for every single job type to prevent this situation. This would make mincome pointless ! In addition, Labour market flexibility would substantially drop and we could expect involuntary unemployment to rise (since demand-offer courbe is no longer followed).\" Objection: If Mr. Mario knows that he could get 1000$/month anyway, he would have the power to negotiate his salary in a fair way with his employer. Mr. Mario would probably say \"Listen boss, if you don't pay me more than a 1000$/month, I simply quit, I will get mincome anyway\" So you see, employers will have to offer wages higher than mincome if they want to attract any employees. Now you might be tempted to object that Mr. Mario would accept low-wage jobs, work less and thus earn less in order to get half of his income covered by mincome. Since this is plausible the state could indeed set a Minimum wage for all jobs, that would be at least as high as Mincome. To be honest, I see nothing wrong with this. Mincome and Minimum wage could work hand in hand: If you lost your job, you get mincome and if you work, you'll get at least minimum wage + you have a lot of negotiating power. *********************************************************************************************************** Your first quote: \"Objection 1 : \"if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn\". Ok so this is about giving everyone free fish forever hoping that they will learn fishing.\" I have no objection here, I completely agree with your quote. But don't forget, mincome wouldn't \"give you free fish\", it would just be the \"fishing rod\" that would help you catch the fish. If you know what I mean. Consider this: Why do most western countries have Universal Healthcare and free education? Easy! Because most people realize that if you want to work, you must be healthy and educated. So the state ensures that everyone is healthy and educated enough to enter the labour market. However, being smart and healthy isn't enough if you want to work. You also need food that will give you enough energy to work and you need a decent shelter if you don't want to freeze to death during winter. So Mincome would be set high enough, so that you can access these necessities, But will be low enough to give you an incentive to work and purchase with your own money the luxuries you desire (iphones, a car, a TV and you name it). Your second quote: \"Objection 2 : If the money comes from outside, it just makes more aid to Africa. The purpose of humanitarian aid is to increase people's quality of life. But it also sustains artificially an unsustainable situation. However I see that the final idea is to take that money from taxes. Very well ! How can Namibia find this money considering they already have a 5,5% of gdp public deficit ?\" Objection: I totally agree that it would be difficult to implement mincome in poor countries. But we should first ask ourselves why so many African countries are poor. One argument is that most African leaders make deals with western companies to suck the wealth of their own people. Another argument is that poor countries (especially in Africa) have to pay back all the money the World Bank or the IMF gave them at very high interest rates. And add all the wars to it. Now this is getting a bit off-topic so I'll stop here but you know what I mean. Your third quote: \"Objection 3 : If we assume that the state intervention is the only possible solution to prevent poverty why should the state just give money to people for nothing ? The state could employ people or orient them towards a sector needing workforce (perhaps by sponsoring studies)\" That's true, and it's already done in most countries, especially in Austria, Sweden, Switzerland... but this system is reaching it's limits. In Sweden for example they hired unemployed people as substitute teachers in public schools. And it's a nice concept but many students complained that the substitutes weren't competent enough. http://en.wikipedia.org... ***************************************************************************************** Quote: \"If there is a sum of money guaranteed for everyone regardless of what they do, there will always be some people taking advantage of the system.\" \"There is no time limit to this aid. Therefore there are many cases of chronically assisted people. Some of them even top up working part time under the table. (That is fraud, and punished by jail time).\" True, but that's something you can't avoid in any system. Even when it comes to healthcare some people have \"accidents\" on purpose so that they can get the insurance money aka. insurance fraud. But that doesn't prevent us from having Universal Healthcare. Small quote to better understand what I mean: \"You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean. If a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean doesn't become dirty\" - Mahatma Gandhi *************************************************************************************** Quote: \"2) More tax pressure on people not receiving Negative income tax. And this represents the largest part of the population (most of them would probably be unhappy, others do not). Coercion is not the answer.\" \"3) We can expect higher inflation rates on basic commodities. This would mean a substantial drop in purchase power for middle classes not benefiting from the aid. The mechanics are simple : If you induce demand artificially (by permanently giving money to people, in this case poor people) prices of basic commodities will rise.\" \"4) Meritocracy, Meritocracy, Meritocracy ! In order to reduce poverty, the state should focus on making possible for the deserving poor to advance in society. I do agree there are some people forced in to poverty by the force of events even if they are competent and probably deserve better. I mean instead of guaranteeing minimum income for all, why not just increase education funding ? For undeserving poor the answer is not giving them taxpayer money. We have private charity for that and some other aid initiatives (e.g In EU , agricultural surplus is distributed freely to poor people )\" Objection 1: There are many models for the negative income tax. But most models share the fact that they would replace several existing forms of social assistance and therefore wouldn't reduce the states annual budget. In Switzerland for example, we have an annual GDP of approx. 600 billion francs. The Swiss government is already using 180 billion francs (1/3) for existing social services. If the \"Basic Income Initiative\" succeeds, it is estimated that the government will have to use 20 billion more francs to finance the BI. In total about a 1/3 of our GDP. As you notice there isn't much of a difference, simply because many existing social services would be replaced. Now imagine a negative income tax initiative in Switzerland. It would cost even less than existing welfare. http://www.admin.ch... http://bien.ch... http://www.businessinsider.com... http://www.bbc.com... Objection 2: On the other hand, people need money if they want to consume and keep the economy going. Objection 3: Meritocracy is fair of course but have you considered technological unemployment which might be a problem in coming years? Once we arrive at that point we might have to rethink the way we manage our economy. One solution might be a BI or the Negative Income Tax, that way people who lost their job due to automation could study, volunteer and develop interests for arts. Maybe you think that most people wouldn't volunteer but per year the UN registers 90 billion work hours in Germany and 60 billion of these work hours are done by volunteers. http://revenudebase.info...

Obviously college benefits the individual even more if it's required to get a halfway-decent job, right? That's exactly the point. But what happens to the rest of the population without a degree? They're left behind to \"feed off the table scraps\".In the book Why Our Colleges and Universities Have Given Up on the Meaning of Life, Anthony T. Kronman, a professor of law at Yale Law School, said: \"All but the most unskilled forms of labor are increasingly based on knowledge of a kind that can be acquired only in school, and in supplying that knowledge America's colleges and universities provide a tremendous service to the individuals who come to them to learn a trade of profession\"[1]. There is no denying the benefit to the individual when he or she receives a college education, but those who do not are limited to all but the most basic of jobs. In defense of my contentionsContention 1) College does not benefit the majorityMy opponent states that the people who do not attend college should not factor into this debate because the resolution doesn't apply to them. This was true, until I brought up my fourth contention. Now, those who do not go to college must be included in this debate as a group of individuals who are suffering the consequences of not going to college. If we are forced to include the individuals who do not attend college, we are now left with a resulting 62.6% of high school graduates who have not benefited - but have actually been impacted negatively - by a college education.Contention 2) College contributes to the already growing income gapGiven my response to my opponent's objection to my first Contention, my opponent's response to my second is also void. Yes, college graduates make more money, and their income has been proven to increase over time compared to the income of blue-collar workers. This is exactly what my point was trying to get across. If the wages of higher educated jobs are increasing faster than the wages of lower education jobs, then that is an income gap that is increasing.Contention 3) College contributes to the destruction of the U.S health care systemMy opponent seemed to misunderstand this contention. Yes, it's true that med-school students have to pay more than regular college students, and yes, they are part of the minority. But I wasn't arguing that. I was arguing that health care prices in the United States are so high BECAUSE med school students have to pay so much towards their educations. It takes an average of 11 years to fully pay off the debt that one acquires through med school, and it is for this reason that the costs of health care in the United States is so high. And seeing as the cost of health care affects everyone, this is an obvious detriment for the majority of the U.S populace.Responding to my opponent's contention:College students make more moneyI agree. The arguments in my fourth contention apply here as well. What about the students that do not attend college? What about the students that can not attend college? It's simple, they are forced to make less than their higher-educated counterparts. So again, I acknowledge the benefits to the individual, but that is insignificant compared to the detriments to the majority.I urge an affirmative vote.Citations:1. http://books.google.com...", "qid": 50, "docid": "e78f47fa-2019-04-18T18:20:34Z-00001-000", "score": 8.791099548339844}, {"content": "Title: The United States should design a universal health care system. Content: I'll get right to it also. Thank you for such a challenge. 1. I don't know if you understand this, but telling me that the uninsured can't afford health insurance means nothing to me. I realize that and I know we need to change things so they can get health insurance. Examples would be withdrawing mandates for individual insurance policies, fostering Health Savings Accounts for day-to-day medical expenses, making health insurance true indemnity insurance and not health maintenance. 2. Why are you avoiding \"he burden would be spread to everyone.\" I think that is part of privacy. Now your health problems are mine and mine are yours. Whether it is part of privacy or not, why did you avoid the argument I was making in my second round? 3. Do you have any kind of evidence for the mentioning of saving $286 Billion on paper work? What kind of paper work does that consist of? Do you realize how many law suits are going on right now because of health care. I stated it in my opening argument. If we have universal health care, people will be going to the doctors that much more because it is free. They don't have to worry about deductibles or anything to that such. Therefore with more people being at the doctor, there is more chances of the doctors being sued which is a huge cost to doctors and the government. 4. As far as doctors go. I found an article that did an actual survey on a certain amount of doctors. It is located here: http://well.blogs.nytimes.com... It basically says that many doctors admit to turning there head to medical errors that are done. They are suppose to report every serious medical error, and in the survey done, some doctors admitted that they don't do that. If the doctors were basically only concerned about the care of patients (like you said) then why would this be happening in hospitals? 5. You fail to understand? Is that because you just don't want to understand or you actually failed? If you are actually a failure at understanding, I don't get it. It makes perfect sense. You can't tell me that they are going to raise our taxes to 40 % of income, because that would make people go crazy. So, to account for this, they are going to have to raise the taxes somewhat and then cut on other spending so taxes don't get to ridiculous. Therefore, they are going to have to cut spending on something. Whether it is medical research, defense, education, whatever, there are going to have to be some cuts in something. 6. Whether that is true or not, that study was from 2000. I'm not sure if it has changed or not, but that is 8 years ago now. And it came out in 2000 so that means that research had to of been done before 2000 and that had to take awhile. None the less, you don't have to tell me twice that our health care system is bad. You wouldn't even have to tell me once, because I realize that. Now, are you able to tell me that ALL those countries ahead of us have universal health care? Probably not therefore leading to my point that universal health care is not need to be said to have the best health care accord to \"WHO\". 7. Yes, I did argue that they are somewhat biased. I never voted in any of those polls, so that's leaving out at least me. Maybe everyone else in the U.S. voted on those polls but not me. I don't find that realistic. Saying the U.S. wants universal health care because of an internet poll or what some reporter says, really does nothing to me. I can go out and talk out of my butt and probably get some people to believe me. But I am not going to do that, instead I am going to sit here and talk the truth and try to educate people. The democracy and everyone has a right to health care point that you were trying to make, makes sense to me. But realize, everyone DOES have a right to health care right now. Some may have to pay more than others, some not. Everyone has the right to insurance, somewhere. You can bring up the movie Sicko that says some people were denied insurance, but overall that is not true. I work in the insurance field and I deal with things like this all the time. Some companies may deny them, but there are always companies that will take people in. 8. As far as this goes, look at other countries with universal health care, they are put on lists just to get looked at. Come on, why should we be doing this to ourselves? I look at the DMV and VA and realize that those are 2 government ran agencies near me and people HATE going to both of them. I don't want to hate going to the doctor. 9. Please explain to me what paperwork are we loosing when we have universal health care. Does that still cover all of the paper work for the patients, the health care cards that need to be printed for everyone, the more law suits that will be happening, and all of these expenses? I think you should think about that number a little more. Is the GOVERNMENT really spending that much money on paperwork right now? I think more like the insurance companies might be spending a lot of money on paperwork, but I don't see how the government can be responsible for all THAT much paperwork that will now be gone. Your New Point - As far as that goes, there are many options that we can go about using to fix our health care. Some that I said above. For you to say that you know of no other options, that sounds like a very liberal remark and maybe you should stick your head out of the liberal media box and get welcomed into the real world. Do you listen to our great President George W. Bush talk? Maybe you should because he has mentioned many new ideas. Do you listen to the presidential debates for the republican side? Maybe you should because the talk about many options available to us. I would like to say that I have talked a lot to your very little, you were just saying how I am wrong with the things I brought up and nothing really to say other than \"Your Wrong, Next\".

The second part is that while yes it does work it is not a universal program it only focuses on a section of the people not everyone. Also as a side note one person cant keep an entire system working and by saying you have a good president still wont solve the problem of having a working program, its just to big of a job. 2. The first point on this flow id like to say feeling good because its one less thing to worry about wont protect the people from the absurd taxing like you proposed in the plan. Also they wont be paying less because as it is now the companies help pay and fund the different insurances. In all a unviersal health care would completely collapse our already fraying economy. 3. So this whole argument contradicts the point of a universal health care, to keep hospitals and doctors still private would not reach the perspective of a universal health care since not everyone is entitled to the same thing. Bringing us back to the heart of capitalism, competition which will be lacking if the plan is implemented. 4. Your still missing the point there are systems like Medicare like you mention that cover people who are in need of it. The reason why I mentioned this is because you could argue that if people wouldn't get attention which i was proving incorrect but since you agree theres no need to argue this any more. 5. Really the points you make here are just not true, when funded by the government like every other program ran by the government the doctors will be told what to do and how to do it. I mentioned India because they have a universal health care system and it is one of the poorest in the world this being the leading reason, doctors don't care as much anymore. 6. No it wouldn't lower because in this new system everyone basically pays the same amount, for people like me I go in once a year for a physical other than that I'm relatively healthy so why should i pay that much more, when other people who choose a unhealthy lifestyle and cost more a year eventually raising prices for me to help take care of the unhealthy person thats why a universal health care system would be bad. 7. While that may be true eventually its the transition that will kill the economy before the cavalry comes. Also look to point 8 on the flow and this ties in with this point in the fact that less doctors would want to do the job so they wouldn't be in such large demand. 8. Again look to point 3 and how this contradicts the point of a universal health care if everything is still privatized. To deny the fact that doctors become doctors because of the fame and status is just ignorant, sure some may not fit the type but the vast majority do. 9. So basically your conceding to the fact that since our health coverage is working why change it so thank you. As another side note any country with a universal health coverage none of them have a good system, just a bare system. Also its not a right its a privilege that you should work hard for not be given to you on a silver spoon. 10. The point to this argument here is that health care in other nations like India, see point 5, because they are so poor and ours is so great changing that would hurt everything in our medical infrastructure and see my other points as to how universal cant be socialized or privatized.

May the best debater win. I want to thank my opponent for posting his argument. My opponent believes that healthcare is a right, and not a service. Basically, he is saying that the right to live is a service, and not a right. This is because if you are uninsured, then you will not be able to receive vaccinations or any medical treatment if you get sick, which is necessary if you want to live. I find this very un-american and unethical. Everyone, no matter how \"unlucky\" they are, should have the right to live. My opponent suggests that the majority of people in the United States are ignorant concerning healthcare. This may be. However, our government was founded on a democracy. People may be ignorant about many things. However, if the people vote for it, then it is the responsibility of the government to \"make it happen\", so to speak. Currently, over 66 percent of the American people want it. Now, I want to quote two paragraphs from: . http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com... \"Most insurance companies are for profit corporations and as such have a CEO, CFO, president, board of directors, salespersons, other employees, and shareholders to which dividends must be paid. Therefore the total amount of money any insurance company can payout is the total amount of insurance premiums collected, plus any income or loss made on the investment of those premiums, minus the salary of the CEO, minus the salary of the CFO, minus the salary of the President, minus the salary of board of directors, minus the salaries and bonuses of salespersons, minus the salaries of other employees, minus the dividends paid to shareholder. This scenario works well for insuring just about everything except health care. In order to cover those large non-healthcare expenses, insurance companies must attempt to insure only healthy people thus denying many with preexisting conditions any coverage. They must deny as many surgeries and procedures they can get away with and they must deny many medications. \" Basically, this means that insurance companies don't care about their customers. They care on only making profit. As a result, insurance companies deny as many surgeries and medications as possible. A strong and clear example of this is the story I narrated in the first round of this debate about Nataline Sarkisyan. There are many other examples of this. Using this, we can say that drastic change is needed in out healthcare system. We have tried PPO's and HMO's (Preferred Provider Organization and Health Maintenance Organizations), but they fail to reduce the cost and insure everyone. Our only other option is to implement universal healthcare. Now, I want to express why we shouldn't we let people buy better health care if they can afford it. Whenever we allow the wealthy to buy better care, health care for the rest of us (middle class and lower) suffers. Programs for the poor become poor programs. For instance, because Medicaid doesn't serve the wealthy, the payment rates are low and many physicians refuse to see Medicaid patients. Advocates who say that medicaid should be improved are disregarded because the beneficiaries are not considered politically important. However, if the wealthy are forced to rely on the same health system as the poor, they will use their political power to assure that the health system is well funded. . http://www.pnhp.org... I want to include why a universal healthcare system will benefit the government. With universal healthcare, the government will save an average of $400 billion per year. \"$400 billion could be saved each year, enough to pay for a single payer system and to eliminate all co-pays and deductables,\" said Almberg, speaker behalf of the PNHP. . http://www.pww.org... To end my round, I will provide a link which will lead you to a table comparing the costs of universal healthcare compared to the current healthcare system. . http://www.grahamazon.com...

Dr. Evelyn Forget forgot basic economics, if a situation is precarious (4 years in a lifetime) people will not adapt to it.Milton Friedman permanent income hypothesis tell us that \"changes in permanent income, rather than changes in temporary income, are what drive the changes in a consumer's consumption patterns.\" This model can also be applied to the relation between working hours and free time : People won't work less unless they perceive their income change is permanent (which it definitely wasn't)http://en.wikipedia.org...http://www.nber.org...- It was in people best interest to make the study obtain good results. Behaviour : Workings habits unchanged / Reward : more chances to pass the law and make Mincome permanent.Psychological term is positive reinforcement.http://en.wikipedia.org...http://www.simplypsychology.org...- Analogy drug testing to minimize psychological effects affecting study's results placebo are given to some of the patient. The aim is si mple : if nobody really knows if they have the drug in their system its effects can be isolated from the rest. In this study there was no placebo, people were aware to be lab rats- Small villages are in fact not representative of the whole population of a country.So while this study seems to be very precise (thorough scientific methods) it also appears not very accurate (initial bias was too large). Low accuracy High Precision situation (see image below) \"Contrary to most basic income models, the negative income tax, would only give the amounted of money needed to the people who need it. That's why it would be a cheap way to de facto implement a basic income.\" Objection : What does prevent the employers from adjusting wage rates in order to discharge costs on the state.Ex : Mincome is set at 1000$ per month. Mr. Mario who works as an apprentice plumber earns 1000$ per month and therefore nothing is added to his incomeMr. Luigi who works as a pizzaiolo earns 700$ per month. Mincome will provide him with the extra 300$What would happen if Mr. Mario employer decided to cut his salary to 700$ (or hire new personnel at 700$) ? The state would have to set minimum wages for every single job type to prevent this situation. This would make mincome pointless ! In addition, Labour market flexibility would substantially drop and we could expect involuntary unemployment to rise (since demand-offer courbe is no longer followed).http://economics.about.com...Besides we would have to make sure that this kind of employment subsidizing is not in violation of transnational trade agreements by artificially reducing production costs. Retaliation from others countries have to be expected. (As Free trade is not the subject of the debate, I will not develop this more).************************************************Now let's take you Namibian example. Results are really astonishing indeed ! Let's look at this quote from one of the articles you provided.http://www.spiegel.de...\"The idea is simple: The payment of a basic monthly income, funded with tax revenues, of 100 Namibia dollars, or about \u20ac9 ($13), for each citizen. There are no conditions, and nothing is expected in return. The money comes from various organizations, including AIDS foundations, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and Protestant churches in Germany's Rhineland and Westphalia regions.\"Objection 1 : \"if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn\". Ok so this is about giving everyone free fish forever hoping that they will learn fishing.Objection 2 : If the money comes from outside, it just makes more aid to Africa. The purpose of humanitarian aid is to increase people's quality of life. But it also sustains artificially an unsustainable situation.However I see that the final idea is to take that money from taxes. Very well ! How can Namibia find this money considering they already have a 5,5% of gdp public deficit ?- Borrowing from financial markets (Not sure it's a wise choice)- Creating a special tax aiming richer people in order to redistribute wealthhttp://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org...About Redistribution of wealth. Namibia has a very poor Gini index 0.59 (US is 0.45 and average European country is around 0.3X). Some would just argue about how unfair this is and urge to redistribute income in a more just way.http://www.worldbank.org...What's the difference between Namibia and Western countries ? Namibia is still a developing country !Salary is unequal in Namibia because you have a huge pool of low skilled labour and a lack of medium/high skilled labour (it just widens the gap even more).Countries like the US already reached a stable equilibrium between low skilled/medium skilled/high skilled labor. Gini coefficient remained quite stable during the past decades.So yes, many poor Africans need financial help so they can go to school or university in order to create a balanced and sustainable society where in the long term people success is determined by meritocratic standards. But this intervention should be temporary and not permanent !(By the way, most African governments received international aid for decades and wasted it ! That's a pity... but this is off topic)Redistributing in Africa is pretty much like rationing in War time Europe. You can't compare true poverty (famine, malnourishment etc.. with our Western \"poverty)http://en.wikipedia.org...Objection 3 : If we assume that the state intervention is the only possible solution to prevent poverty why should the state just give money to people for nothing ? The state could employ people or orient them towards a sector needing workforce (perhaps by sponsoring studies)SOME ARGUMENTS1) If there is a sum of money guaranteed for everyone regardless of what they do, there will always be some people taking advantage of the system.In Belgium for example the state gives about 700\u20ac per month to every isolated person without any income and 400\u20ac if cohabiting. The state also tops up your income if it is inferior to the amount (this doesn't happen very often because full time minimum wage is above 1000\u20ac)Conditions for obtaining this aid are very general. The state only checks out you have no other income and of course you must be a legal permanent resident and of course earning less than the amount.There is no time limit to this aid. Therefore there are many cases of chronically assisted people. Some of them even top up working part time under the table. (That is fraud, and punished by jail time).Source is in French so I also declare on my honour this is true.http://www.belgium.be...2) More tax pressure on people not receiving Negative income tax. And this represents the largest part of the population (most of them would probably be unhappy, others do not). Coercion is not the answer.3) We can expect higher inflation rates on basic commodities. This would mean a substantial drop in purchase power for middle classes not benefiting from the aid. The mechanics are simple : If you induce demand artificially (by permanently giving money to people, in this case poor people) prices of basic commodities will rise.4) Meritocracy, Meritocracy, Meritocracy ! In order to reduce poverty, the state should focus on making possible for the deserving poor to advance in society. I do agree there are some people forced in to poverty by the force of events even if they are competent and probably deserve better. I mean instead of guaranteeing minimum income for all, why not just increase education funding ?For undeserving poor the answer is not giving them taxpayer money. We have private charity for that and some other aid initiatives (e.g In EU , agricultural surplus is distributed freely to poor people )To summarize my conclusion is that the role of the state should not be to provide unconditioned and unlimited in time welfare to everyone. The role of the state should be to provide a safe and just environment in which people can advance according to basic principles of meritocracy. But If for some reason the state must take urgent action (severe crisis etc...) it should be more about helping people learning to catch fishes than giving free fish.", "qid": 50, "docid": "ac032197-2019-04-18T15:34:03Z-00002-000", "score": 8.488300323486328}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income Content: His plan increases the \u201cincome effect\u201d compared to a UBI The entire premise of my opponent\u2019s argument is that everyone will get at least $15,000 and full employment. The differences between a UBI and a means tested program are not significant under the current system, as far as income effects go, for poor people, and both programs retain work efforts at the lowest income levels. My opponent\u2019s plan, however, provides an extra $5,000 in income at this level for those in the private sector. The difference between no assistance and assistance under Con\u2019s plan is more than it would be under a UBI, meaning his plan would reduce work incentives compared to a UBI. EITC reduces work incentives for many groups Con claims the EITC has mechanisms which reduce the negative effects of the phase-ou. Economic research has demonstrated that the EITC significantly discourages work for many demographics, especially women. Women in the phase-out portion of the EITC become 5% less likely to work, and for women who are already working, women work 20% fewer hours per year.[1] Another study came to the same conclusion, and discovered evidence of a negative impact on many females. \u201c[T]he EITC explains 71 percent of the decline in low-educated married mothers\u2019 desire to work between 1988-1993 and 1994-2010\u2026While the \u201cwelfare to work\u201d reform was designed to do bring welfare recipients into the labor force, the reform could have had the opposite effect on the \u201cweaker\u201d nonparticipants by shifting them from a program with some connection to the labor force (welfare) to a program with no connection to the labor force (disability insurance).\u201d[2] Wage subsidies, like the EITC, introduce multiple distortions in the labor market. These distortions are favorable to low-wage industries, making domestic production costs lower. This means imports are negatively affected, which distorts trade, and hurts the economy.[3] By making the EITC more generous, we would be increasing the work disincentives for women. A more generous EITC would also increase distortions in the labor market. The issue with public works and education Con\u2019s plan is trying to create a quasi-universal basic income system, but instead through providing employment and job training. This solution is problematic. The way Con sets up his plan would negatively affect the private sector. There are two scenarios for poor people: either they get nothing, work for the government/educate and get a $10,000 UBI, or work for the private sector and at least earn $15,000. This plan creates a whole new level of bureaucracy and would drastically increase spending--Con\u2019s claim that this would somehow reduce spending is insane. The plan causes thousands if not millions of new people to work for the public sector. The issue with this is that there would be a \u201ccrowd out\u201d effect. Many tasks the government completes could be provided for by the private sector if the government wasn\u2019t providing them. While government expands, the private sector retreats.[12] We must weigh the two effects. The crowd out effect would affect all industries, because my opponent\u2019s plan has to be able to, at full capacity, be able to employ the entire country. Every industry will experience some type of crowd out. The cost of his job guarantee for low-income people in order for them to obtain welfare is extremely large. This is essentially his plan: People are poor. People need assistance. They must work in order to get assistance. The government should offer work to those who are currently idle. Thus, he basically is ensuring work for anyone who wants it. It is implied that the government should be able to, at maximum capacity, provide work for 300 million people. But this means the government would have to get involved in all industries: fast food, technology, yard work, etc. The reason is because we only have so many construction projects, and many construction projects are already done efficiently by the private sector. When public roads are fixed, all public buildings repaired, and all museums erected, what then? What if the demand for these new products (like museums) wane over time? Or a recession strains the system and it cannot handle the influx of workers? The simple fact is these public works programs would not be doing traditional public construction jobs after a period of time, and the government would be forced to distort the market by entering formerly private industries in order to ensure employment. The cost of such a program would be enormous. Under a UBI, you simply hand over the check. Under a job guarantee/workfare regime, you have to pay managers, supervisors, and other bureaucrats in order to supervise work projects. You would have to pay for the education programs, the teachers, and administrators. You would require a large number of other employees to make sure everyone receiving benefits needs it; the increase in administrative complexity and costs would be enormous. Under a UBI, administrative costs would be virtually zero. Nothing about the UBI restricts or inhibits public work programs. As I already explained, the UBI increases work incentives, on balance, even for those who are at the bottom of the income ladder. This means implementing a UBI would expand the size of the labor market and it would be easier to staff public work programs. A study in Germany predicts a UBI would increase the labor supply and increase work incentives.[4] The U.S. is considered the most innovative economy because of its \u201ccut throat\u201d capitalism and private sector innovation.[9] By making the government the largest employer and heavily distorting private markets, the U.S. economy would be destined to become less innovative and productive. It would be much more efficient to allow the private sector to deal with education and employment. Marco Rubio has an education plan that promotes and encourages vocational training using private sector mechanisms.[5] The research on vocational training is ambiguous, with the GAO saying any \u201cpositive impacts [from vocational training tend] to be small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\u201d[17] A 2008 study found no difference in employment, wage, and economic outcomes for those who have gone through work training programs compared to those who had not.[18] Did workfare work in the past? Con claims the welfare reform act of 1996 dramatically reduced welfare rolls and increased work incentives. This argument is flawed because welfare rolls were falling before the implementation of workfare. One study found only \u201c15 percent of the decline [in welfare rolls] is due to welfare reform, the rest to the significant expansion of low-wage work during the 1990s.\u201d[6] In other words, economic growth reduced welfare rolls. Another study published in the American Economic Review argues 50% of the decline in welfare roles was due to a reduction in number of people receiving welfare.[7] This has important implications for those who interpret welfare reform as a success. A reduction in the number of families receiving welfare may have negative impacts on those at the bottom of the income ladder. Indeed, of those who have been kicked off of or became ineligible for welfare, \u201cmost are in poverty.\u201d[6] Economists who have reviewed the literature also note how only about one third, at best, of the reduction in caseloads is due to welfare reform.[8] The benefits of my opponent\u2019s counterplan are overstated Keeping people out of poverty is a benefit of both of these plans, according to Con. But as I noted, the significant distortions in the labor market caused by his plan may make the situation worse, and require that the U.S. becomes the largest employer in the country. In the long term, this would reduce not only U.S. but also global economic growth and innovation. His plan would not reduce wasteful spending. A UBI would eliminate administrative costs. His plan increases costs, because not only are you giving money to people, you are also doling out paychecks to thousands of extra unnecessary employees that oversee the public works. A UBI program is affordable.[10][11] My opponent\u2019s plan would undoubtedly increase costs. The production of skilled workers is much better suited for the private sector, mainly due to the massive public costs of ensuring education for every poor person if they wish to pursue it (and by artificially increasing the amount of skilled workers, the value of education would fall and reduce wages for those who are already educated). Crime rediction is nonunique. Poor people, who are more likely to commit crime, often do so in order to make a living. One way to fix this, as my opponent notes, is to give them a job. But a UBI would have the same effect: by reducing financial hardship, a motive for crime would be substantially weakened; a UBI would also increase social cohesion. In Nambia after a UBI was implemented, crime fell by 42% due to an increase in cohesion.[13] In India, UBIs increased economic activity and school attendance.[14] Obtaining unearned income makes people more sociable. When people earn small lottery winnings, the ones close to UBI level, it has been found \u201cthat unearned income improves traits that predict pro-social and cooperative behaviours\u2026 as well as reduce individuals' tendency to experience negative emotional states.\u201d[15] A UBI would have the same effect, meaning a UBI would positively impact our society. When the government does more, the private sector does less, and oftentimes the crowd out effect is larger than the benefits of increased public works. An research suggests increased infrastructure spending is a poor economic stimulus and the crowd out effect more than cancels out the benefits of increased infrastructure spending.[16] Creating other public goods, if there is no demand for them, is a net-negative because the taxpayer has to pay for these institutions. http://bit.ly...", "qid": 50, "docid": "4d103774-2019-04-18T13:49:55Z-00001-000", "score": 8.459099769592285}, {"content": "Title: USA should spend significantly less Content: I have waited for you to post another comment so I could include it in this post and then move back to defending my own arguments, and agreeing with or contradicting some of your arguments. I have waited two days but it seems you have given up on this debate. - Department of Education The department of education is probably one of the worst branches of the government to cut spending in. Basic education leads to smarter people, which make up a society in which you can rely on other people to make better decisions. Unless you are planning on solving all of tomorrows problems yourself, we will need a country where everyone gets at least a basic education. Education is the highest return investment a country can make. The better people are educated the easier it is for them to find a job and provide for themselves and not rely on government help. But it seems you also wish to get rid of this government help. - Head Start While it is true that the effectiveness of Head Start has been a matter for debate, the arguments against are that kids who participated in the program, usually end up in low income schools, which undo the benefits of the program. So instead of cutting this program and leaving poor kids to end up poorer than their parents. We should invest in kids who have even less to say about their financial state than their parents. Instead of using local property tax to fund local schools, the federal government should distribute the wealth better. This so more money ends up in low income schools, as they are chronically underfunded. Because of the current system, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. - Meals on Weels Almost half the budget of Meals on Wheels comes from gifts. The program was made to fight senior lonelyness and poverty. These people have contributed to the country most of their lives, and once we're done leaching them out, we should leave them to starve? - Section 8 This housing section funded by the government costs quite a bit of money, it has a higher return than the investment that it takes. Also, the buildings are privately owned, but without the help of the government, the private sector would not be willing to take in tenants who have an uncertain income. So in this case the private sector will definitely not fix it. You also seemed to not have read my rebuttal because I named basic security as one of the main arguments for govermnent involvement. Housing and food are considered basic security. I perhaps also did not elaborate enough on the article I posted: it concludes poor decisionmaking isn't a prerequisite for poverty, however poverty will lead to poor decisionmaking. http://www.sciencemag.org... So basically providing people with a house they can live in and providing people with food, will make them smarter people, will make them feel more responsible, and make them less dangerous (with regards to crime). This is a very nice article about crimes of desperation with a staggering conclusion; for every $ spent on measures to reduce poverty (provide housing, food, clothes,...) 6$ can be saved in costs to society (damage done, justice system). http://www.calgaryunitedway.org... What I meant by saying that basically all government programs could run better, was that there is always room for improvement and that we shouldn't stop looking for ways to make them more efficient. Instead of cutting spending from the top down, the programs themselves should be encouraged to either achieve the same goals with less, or to achieve more with the same amount of money. Working the other way around however, would lead to the programs working less efficiently. Basically I hope you will not have a hand in reforming the budget of the United States, as you would leave the poor to die out on the streets, leave the elderly to starve in their homes and generally reward rich people for being rich. Maybe a good question to ask yourself is: what do we need money for. Is money not a means to an end, a way to allow people to survive and thrive? I think making money, and having a part of that money go to making this country a better place to live in for everyone, a beautiful idea. And instead of looking at \"what does it cost me\", look at \"how does it benefit the people of the U.S.A.\". Choosing the advancement of society over personal gain is what defines us as humans. Without it, we would not have started building roads, we wouldn't have health care, education for everyone, we wouldn't have most of our technology. \"Overcoming poverty is not a gesture of charity.

Income taxes are a tax on success & 2. Progressive Tax Rates is straight out of the Communist ManifestoMy opponent makes several unfounded assumptions here. Firstly, a flat income tax would wipe out all tax margins, simplify the tax code, and make everyone pay the same percentage of their income. These would accomplish everything my opponent sets out in doing.Secondly, my opponent makes the assumption that the wealthy pay well above the poor as a percentage of their income in taxes. Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest man in America, famously made the case that the wealthy should pay more. He paid less, as a percentage of his income, than his secretary. Warren Buffett paid 17.4% in taxes, while his secretary paid 35.8%[1] Curious results from a \"communist\" policy.Thirdly, my opponent says there is a disincentive to make more money because of income tax brackets. My answer is only this. Would you not want to make more money because you pay more in taxes? Of course not. The progressive tax system requires more of wealthy individuals. Why? Because they make more. Its that simple.3. Tax Code and IRS are archaic, obsolete, and far to comprehensiveI agree that the tax code needs to be simplified. I also agree there are reasons why a number of exemptions exist, and we can not get rid of all of them, categorically, because its messy. We can and should simplify the tax code. But it should be done with a scalpel, not a shovel.-----A National Sales Tax-----We can talk about the philosophy of a tax code all day and get nowhere, so I'll just get straight to the facts.1. None of my opponents sources or his plan says how high the sales tax would have to be in order to make the same revenue as the income tax. 2. In fact, none of his sources go into any specifics of a national sales tax, they're just sites stating pros and cons.3. According to the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center in 2005, a national sales tax would require 60% additional cost to products just to match the revenue provided by income tax[2]. This study was conducted in an economic boom. Now, the percentage would have to be much higher to account for the loss in revenue.4. A 60% increase in the cost of products would dramatically decrease demand for products in a recession(producing a double-dip recession).5. The national sales tax unfairly targets the poor[3]. The poor spend a huge percentage of their income on products they need to survive, and we cut their ability to do so by 60%-making the poor poorer.6. Seniors have already paid income taxes and payroll taxes into the system all their lives. They largely live on reduced incomes, and making a consumption tax would be, in effect, taxing them twice. Inherently, taking back the sixth amendment would have to eliminate the payroll tax as well, leaving seniors with no income and a huge tax rate just to survive.In short, a national sales tax hurts everyone it sets out to help. It hurts the poor by reducing their means to live to a tiny percentage of what it was. It hurts seniors when they need their benefits most. It hurts the middle class by cutting their ability to buy. It hurts the rich because people buy fewer of their products. It hurts the economy and everyone in it.I look forward to closing arguments![1]http://abcnews.go.com...[2]http://www.businessweek.com...[3]http://economics.about.com...", "qid": 50, "docid": "df0e0c27-2019-04-18T18:06:31Z-00001-000", "score": 8.31309986114502}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income Content: Full resolution: The United States should begin to convert existing welfare programs into a universal basic income (UBI).

Due to this population increase there are stories and markets that supply our needs to survive however healthcare should not be a basic right and if it were, it would be deadly to the society it was introduced.We see it right now in America where everyone is already or being forced to have healthcare, the average family pays about $16,000 a year.* The average family income falls in between $50,000-60,000.* This high healthcare cost is due to everyone being forced to have healthcare, even those who do not need it, the cost is high because completely healthy people are forced to pay for those who can't afford it. If healthcare were to be a basic right as it is becoming in America the cost of $16,000 per average family would go up drastically and due to the flood of immigrants, who are making a new life and can not be expected to pay anything, and the rise of poverty would add strain to the economy that would break it in the end. Some would retort that the government is there to distribute money to help the poor and underprivileged, raising the income of a family, thereby reducing the strain on the healthcare cost. I put forth this question, \"Where does this money come from?\" If the government is giving money to the lower classes where does the money to do so come from? It comes from one of two sources, one source is that the government prints from the bank. That brings problems with itself in the form of inflation, the more a government prints money the more the value of the money goes down. An example would be Germany in 1921 After World War 1. Germany under war debts turned to printing money to pay it's debts off but the repercussions were traumatic to the country as at one point 1 US dollar equaled 800 German Marks. * Of course the more favored way is to tax the upper echelon for the money needed to give to lower class. Although there lies the poison apple that many countries are biting today. If one's country puts a heavy tax on the class that is sustaining the economy such as Walmart, Target, Ford, Apple, Xbox, and the \"1%\" that make all the money and provide all our needs to survive than those businesses and people would be making an income equal to a middle class family but still trying to support their businesses and slowly but surely the business would die off. Plus those working hard in the middle class and being taxed to death for the sake of the poor at one point would say, \"Screw this if I am working hard to make less than those who don't work than I would rather not work and get the benefits.\" This would led to a degenerate culture hellbent on playing the system to get more benefits and money till it breaks. A culture who tries to make everyone have the same standard of living by causing others to fall no matter what it is, whether it is healthcare, income level, or by giving different tax rates for different class levels is doomed to fail miserably. * http://www.ncsl.org... *http://www.mybudget360.com... *https://en.wikipedia.org...", "qid": 50, "docid": "5d28666e-2019-04-18T14:09:38Z-00004-000", "score": 8.26609992980957}, {"content": "Title: The US ought to provide an universal basic income.

Second, according to David Morris of Fortune, studies by the Roosevelt Institute indicate that a basic income would grow the economy by 12.5 % and shrink the federal deficit, meaning that a UBI would help the overall economy and goverment, not hurt it. Third, consider the cost of poverty on society, as children struggle through school as they work, as homeless people live on the streets, and many struggle to meet ends meet. Are they truly doing the best for our country impoverished. Millions who could be potential engineers, doctors, and scientists are currently wasting their potential, through no fault of their own, merely by the virtue of their social class. Forth, social programs in the status quo have spent billions of dollars with little to nil result. We could simply cut money from those programs in order to help fund a UBI. He says that people will become lazy and won't want to work. However, this is key to help mitigate the problems of climate change as proven by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, will nil adverse effects as countries throughout Western Europe have had similar levels of work for decades on end. Additionally, this isn't unique to UBI, as the status quo already does exactly that. He says that a job gurantee would solve the problem of unemployement, but I must ask; Where are these jobs? Where is the US going to magically sploof up several million jobs. How exactly is this a permanent solution, as at some point AI and automation will simply be better. It is incredibly unlikely that every single American will somehow find the time and money in order to better educated themselves in the new age of technology, meaning that we would likely have these problems regardless.He says that the dollar is key to political rights, however, it only takes one part in the overall goverment. There's democratic activities such as voting, running for office, protesting, civil disobidience and such which all allow nationals to take part in their goverment. I'll now deal with my opponents rebuttal.UBI gurantees that regardless of the circumstance, there will always be a net underneath you. If a business fails, the entrapener won't be sleeping on the streets. Same too applies for financial insecurity. If one wishes to quit their job, they have the ability to do so, as they have a source of income independent of their job. If my opponent needs to see the evidence where exactly this will occur, I simply suggest clicking on the article cited beforehand. If he needs further, may I suggest Scott Santeens' Medium article entitled Inequality and the Basic Income Guarantee. It goes both into entrepreneurship and education.On lower work hours, simply refer to what my opponent himself said in how he argued that a UBI would lower overall work hours. He's contradicting himself in saying there's no evidence to say UBI would lower work hours while only a few paragraphs above saying the exact opposite. Welfare programs lower the need to work, it's as simple as that. An UBI or NIT would bring forth the same basic effect, however, it would be greater under a UBI as it is provided to everyone, not simply those below the poverty line (or whatever thresehold one wishes to set it at). It wouldn't just be the poorest of the poor not working, many of the near and middle class would join in, guaranting that the intended effects would be brought forth.On inequality, I'll simply offer an anology. Envision a room full of 100 children (hopefully not locked up by ICE) where 1 has 101 candies and 99 have 1. If the 1 child had to give everyone else 1 candy, then everyone would have at 2 candies, and be a much more equal society. By the sheer virtue of the population size of the lower and middle class compared to the upper class, they will get a great deal more. Effectly, UBI is a great equallizer for a society, lowering overall inequallity.For these reasons I strongly urge voting for the motion.", "qid": 50, "docid": "b7051d6f-2019-04-18T11:25:14Z-00000-000", "score": 8.245100021362305}, {"content": "Title: Universal Basic Income Content: This debate is for 1harder's Spring Regular Tournament.

America does offer more services in their healthcare but that aside a major reason that it is less expensive is that the government takes care of the cost's. Of course this is not out of charity but comes in the form of a 75% income tax but you know everyone loves to get 25 cents out of every dollar they earn. That is how they are able to afford this way of health care. If you like having everything decided for you and have little to no freedom then universal healthcare is the way to go! Once the system is put into the government's hands then what difference is there in that and a monopoly. If the government has control over the entire system and all insurers fall under their dominion what is stopping them from raising the price of the healthcare. However the government would never do that, right? If some of you are thinking that the government's control of everything would be good than why aren't monopolies good? If an entity has absolute control over an area of life or a good than people would throw a fit that the entity was corrupt and there needs to be something done about it. However when the government does it people are all more than happy to fall in line and celebrate because the people running the government are all \"good and moral\" citizens. There is no difference between a monopoly and a government gone rampant for power. Therefore the notion of universal health care can not and should not be a right in any sense of the form, people deserve what they work for not what they whine for. http://www.theatlantic.com... http://www.npr.org... http://www.slate.com... http://taxfoundation.org...", "qid": 50, "docid": "5d28666e-2019-04-18T14:09:38Z-00000-000", "score": 7.993899822235107}, {"content": "Title: The federal minimum wage should be increased Content: I know some people are forced to work minimum wage, but many dropouts have the opportunity to keep going in their education and chose not to because of the enticing pay and easier work. You mention people would be paid more, but you either get paid more or get paid nothing since many people end up getting laid off. I think it would be better if more people had jobs, but the jobs paid less then less people getting work but those who do get paid more. You mention we would get 9.5 billion dollars into the economy, but the quality of the economy itself would decrease, considering there would be less jobs and the jobs lack the quality they used to. This would make it harder for anyone to find jobs in the first place, hurting the economy further. It would be like pumping money into the economy, but getting nothing back in return. You seem to be focusing on just the benefits to the poor, while in doing so you are hurting everyone else. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only about 5% of US hourly paid workers for for or below the federal minimum wage. Out of these, most are young, unskilled, high school dropouts. Consider this situation- the wage increases, and since they have to pay more the corporation has to fire some employees. Who are they going to fire; unskilled, younger people with a lower education, or educated people with more experience and skills? The choice is obvious! This would hurt the poor more than help them, because instead of a lower paying jobs they would end up with nothing. I get they can't get out of the poor cycle and some are unable to attain good education, but now they are completely unable to obtain a job rather than get one, albeit with low pay. But some money is better than none. So, we've established that minimum wage jobs are usually taken by unskilled and generally uneducated people who are poor. Since they are poor, they can't get a good education, so basically they are forced into a lower paying job. But why should they get paid more? Sadly, they are unskilled so they should do a basic job. Is there a reason to give these people more money for bagging groceries and flipping burgers? What i'm trying to say is the amount of money they get is proportional to the amount of work they do and how hard the job is. We'd be giving them more money for doing a basic job that doesn't take much intelligence to complete. Once again, this higher wage would hurt small businesses more than help them. Since they aren't a large corporation, they aren't as affluent and usually have lower pay for workers. Now, they have to pay their workers more. This would make it a lot easier for small businesses to go bankrupt, and they wouldn't be able to give their workers usual job benefits. Again, the quantity and quality of jobs would go down. Your main point is that a higher minimum wage would help people get out of a low income cycle, when it would do just the opposite. Many people who made low income would end up with no income since they had to get laid off, and small business owners who make less as it is would struggle to get by. Smaller/family businesses would definitely suffer.

I misunderstood ur proposition. What ur proposing involves completely free healthcare for people who cannot afford healthcare. That IS socialism, not to mention entirely unfair. The majority of this country can afford healthcare. People work hard, study, go to college, solely for the purpose of making enough money to meet their needs. Why Should those who work hard, have to pay, while those who (generally speaking of course)dont work hard don't have too? What kind of incetive does that leave for people to want to work hard. All that tells people is that if they dont do their share of the work, the government will give them free money. You can argue that its not fair that the people who cant afford healthcare dont get any, but all your plan does is switch the playing field. Instead of it being unfair for the poor, it'll be unfair for those who can afford healthcare. Everyone MUST pay their own way. Let me elaborate on my point about people not taking the initiative to move up. I am from Alabama. My school was across the street from the projects. Ive been all through what was New Orleans. I have seen the definition of poverty. I spent hours repainting, rebuilding, and supplying firewood to houses built in the 20s. I am very familiar with people in these situations. ive made friends with them. Ive slept over at their houses. Ive noticed things about them though. Many of them werent bad off because of crappy luck. They werent bad off because of poor jobs. They were in such a bad position because they didnt know how to spend their money. Families couldnt afford to heat their houses, but they've got go-carts in the front yard. Dad cant bring enough food home, so he grabs his $800 rifle and heads out into the woods. These people dont need our sympathy. They do it to themselves. Their income can provide for healthcare. Its their life-styles that cant. The Biggest problem we face is that people wont pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. EVERYONE has the ability to get a good education. EVERYONE can find someway to finance college. EVERYONE can work hard at their jobs and move up. But they wont. Thats the problem. Now if we choose to give these people money for the insurance or \"pay their costs for them\". Why would they want to better there financial position? Their wouldnt be much a of a reason too. It all starts with one government give away. First its free healthcare. Next its free transportation money so people can get to work. Than its monthly allowances so they can pay for water, electricity and heating. The more we give freely, the less people are gunna work. You dont have to take my word for it. You can look at Europe, particualrly France. France has univeral healthcare paid for by the government. Its also got monthly allowances to all of its citizens. Its also got an aweful economy because of the 4 hour workday most French workers enjoy. It has a very poor work ethic. The problems are bad enough there that people would rather take to the streets and fight the government for free money rather then go to work and earn it. Free healthcare is harmful. For those people who honestly cant afford healthcare... Here's what I propose. Those who cannot afford healthcare register with the government. This does not count the hundreds of people who claim they cannot, but have a 2006 F150 in the front yard, 8 go-carts, and a gun locker the size of their trailer homes. You will need to bring documented proof, that your income will not meet healthcare costs. After you have registered, you and your immediate family will recieve government issued cards, proving their financial inability to buy insurance. Using that card they can get healthcare at government run clinics and hospitals, for free. The catch is, government run hospitals would suck. They wouldnt have the best doctors. They woulnt have the best equiptment available, healthcare would be slow, and people would be placed on waiting lists. Thats not a punishment. Its just a reality of government run hospitals. With this plan, people who genuinely cannot afford healthcare, can get the basic life-sustaining healthcare they need, but still have some insentive to move up. The people who can, but choose to spend their money somewhere else, can choose to either get healthcare, or a plasma screen TV. They wont get sympathy though. Those who can afford healthcare, will get a better level of healthcare from private companies. Nothing is unfair. No insentive is removed.

For a number of my arguments made in my past post, my opponent simply responded by asking for a source. I understand the importance of sources in a debate. However, there are times when sources needn't to be cited. For well known facts, a source is not always necessary. For example, would I need to cite a source to claim \"a Health Care Reform Bill was passed in 2010\". Even though sources could be cited, it would be a waste of time to try to prove this point. Having said that, I will defend all of the statements that I made that my opponent mentioned:a. \"the huge amount of revenue expected to come from tax increases on the rich will certainly not all materialize. \"This is not a particularly controversial statement among economists (although, the extent to which it is true is). Basically, the tax increases in the bill increase tax rates for the rich. These higher tax rates increase an additional disincentive to earn income on top of the tax rates that already exist. That means that the reward of earning income at the top is reduced and the incentive to dodge taxes is increased, therefore less income is earned. This means that, while taxes increase, the tax base decreases. This means that less income is taxed, but at a higher rate. Therefore, more revenue is raised, but not as much as projected. This is a fairly solid theory, but the near unanimous support for this idea in empirical literature should quell all doubt. Even liberal economists acknowledge that this effect doest exist to a degree. At the bottom, I cite an article by Economist Alan Reynolds explaining this in depth, and giving the numerous estimates for just how much High Income people reduce their income in response to higher tax rates. Generally, empirical research has found that there is a large response. b. \"Talking about Medicare savings in a campaign is much easier than actually making cuts in practice. \"The Medicare Savings are largely based on cuts to provider reimbursement rates. If these come to fruition, they will lead to Doctors rejecting Medicare patients at Similar rates to Medicaid Patients. However, they will likely not come into place. Even though the bill relies on these savings, Congress has already extended the well known Doc Fix outside of the Bill. Other savings are not into law. Instead, they appointed a board, known as IPAB, to install cost controls. This board can only make recommendations to Congress, which will likely reject politically unpopular proposals. c. \"There will be pages of new regulations and forms, making it harder to start a new business. \"This is not a claim that should require a source. The fact that the bill is long (2,700 pages long) and that it includes many regulations should be a simple enough statement to not require a source to be cited. There are many new regulations in this bill. These include an employer mandate for larger businesses, making it more expensive to expand and start new businesses. There are also numerous forms and complications in the bill that make owning a business far more complicated. Although I don't believe these simple claims require a source, I will cite a source to support these claims. d. \"On top of this, there a number of surcharges on Insurance Companies in the Health Care Reform Bill, which will be passed on to consumers through higher prices. \"Again, my opponent simply responded by asking for a source. This is not a particularly controversial claim. It is a simple fact that these are included in the Health Care Bill. Therefore, I did not think a source was particularly necessary. Surcharges on Health Insurance Companies are part of the increased revenue used to pay for the bill. Again, I will link to a source here at the bottom. e. \"the bill also includes large tax increases that will hit a significant number of Small Businesses. \"Again, it is a fairly well known fact that the Health Care Bill is largely funded by tax increases aimed at individuals making over $250,000 a year. A large number of these individuals are Small Business Owners. Again, I'm not exactly sure why a fact that is this well known need a source. f. \"Medicaid Patients do not get much better access to Health Care than uninsured patients. Likewise, the bill will lead to much larger Health Care wait times\"I disagree with the point my opponent is making here. First, it is not clear that Medicaid patients do get better care than the uninsured. A survey from the GAO found that Medicaid Patients have worse access to physicians than Uninsured patients. Another large study from the University of Virginia found that surgical Medicaid Patients were 13% more likely to die than surgical patients that were uninsured. These studies would suggest that Medicaid patients get worse care than patients that are uninsured. Of course, my opponent cites a recent study from Oregon showing Medicaid patients have better Health Outcomes than uninsured patients. In my view, this study mostly relied on self reported Health, which is different from actual Health outcomes. Regardless, the evidence is not even clear that Medicaid makes patients better off at all, even though it costs over $300 Billion a year. So, basically, we spend massive amounts on a program that does not even clearly have any positive impact on the Health of the recipients. g. \"I agree completely here. \"I think my opponent mistook my statement here. I agree that the value of Human Life should be of utmost importance in any debate. However, I disagree that the bill saves lives. In fact, through rationing and lost medical innovation, this bill will cost lives. h. \"It seems that my opponent believes that Health Decisions are too important for individuals to make in a private market, and should therefore be made by the government. \"My opponent called this statement an Ad Hominem and Red Herring. I don't see where he is coming from on this. i. \"Insurance Companies may limit care, but not to the extent that governments do. \"All Government Health Care systems ration care. In my second argument, I showed that Canada's system involves very long waiting times. Rationing is the only mechanism through which the government can control costs. In fact, the Bills plan to use IPAB to reduce Medicare Payments is, in fact, rationing (even if they don't call it rationing). j. \"I'm not sure what exactly this entails. \"Check my last post on price controls. To summarize, Price Controls always lead to shortages. k. \"Again, this means that the government forces young adults to buy Insurance. \"This is far from false. A mandate to buy insurance is a key part of bill, basically forcing people to buy insurance. l. \"Yes, those with pre-existing conditions need to be covered. However, forcing insurance companies to cover them will raise prices for everyone. \"I offered solutions in my last post that could take care of those with pre-existing conditions without causing significant harm to the rest of the system. On a final note, Insurance Companies are very different from the government because people aren't forced to pay insurance companies by law (although Health care Reform changed that).

In regards to income-based welfare specifically, it is basically a bunch of people for other\u2019s food and shelter. I\u2019m not quite sure how to word this, so I\u2019ll put it another way. 1. Taking something without paying is stealing. 2. Welfare programs involve low-income people using food stamps to buy things without paying. 3. Welfare participants are therefore thieves. 4. Stealing is unjust. 5. A program that creates thieves is unjust. This leads into my next argument\u2026 Higher taxes and why socialism is not realistic. High taxes involve the government taking a higher portion of the money that you earned. Not only does this tie into stealing, but it is a barrier that middle class workers have to deal with. If the taxes are too high, the middle class with have to rely on welfare to even eat, and then they will have to rely on the upper-class for food stamps and clothing money. If, in the end everyone is the same class with 100% taxation, it would be all good right? Wrong. A major motivator for working is knowing that the amount of money you get is based on your performance. Work extra hard and you might get a raise. Come in to work late and sleep on the job? You\u2019ll probably get fired. A Sophmore at a high school in Minnesota set up an experiment where boys and girls would get one piece of candy for every 5 pushups. First, a socialist system was set up where the total number of pushups would be distributed equally among them whether they did 30 pushups or two. The average number of pushups was 16.2, so each person got 3 pieces of candy. Next, he set up a capitalist system where each person would get candy for every 5 pushups they do themselves. The average number of pushups was 21.2, with the average student receiving 4 pieces of candy. (1) Another major motivator for capitalism is keeping up with the Joneses. If everyone is put on the exact same level, a gigantic amount of consumerism is destroyed, and with that a piece of the economy. Evil Billionaires? When many people think of Social Darwinism, they immediately think of Rockefeller and Carnegie. These people are not robber barons, but rather philanthropists. John Rockefeller donated 10% of his earning to his church, provided funding for a college in Georgia for African-Americans, gave $70 million to the University of Chicago, and founded the Rockefeller Foundation.

I don't think I can spend too much time clarifying this topic. What we're discussing here is a change in policy that essentially erases borders for workers. It puts no new onus on governments. If anything, this resolution favors a reduction in government practices, specifically those that discriminate between those workers who live in the U.S. and those who live without. 1. Justice If the resolution were \"Let any woman take a job anywhere,\" my opponent would likely have found that to be a ridiculously slanted topic. The reason why is because we would then be talking about discriminatory practices against women, where countries might make laws that prevent access to jobs for those of the female sex. The concept of telling someone that, based on their sex, they should have limited access to employment opportunities is abhorrent to many of us, and rightly so. But what is the root of this issue? There are two main reasons. The first is that they're fellow human beings. They matter because all human beings deserve to have access to gainful employment. Any adult human, man or woman, who has the capacity to engage in a certain job to the satisfaction of their employer should have the capacity to apply to engage in that labor. Plain and simple. The reality is that there may not be enough jobs for everyone to obtain employment, but that doesn't change the fact that that employment should be open to both men and women because both are human beings. The second is that those aspects that are innate to who we are should never be used as a source of discrimination. This is the same reason someone with a different skin color should not be discriminated against. These are characteristics that are inherent to the person upon birth. They don't get to choose what sex they are born as, just as they don't get to decide what their skin color is. While their choices may be subject to some scrutiny, it's these characteristics that should not, mainly because they are things that are beyond their control. It is unreasonable to deny someone a basic right such as this based on something out of their control, something essentially accidental, that has no effect on their capacity to engage in the work at hand. Both of these two reasons apply just as strongly to those individuals who are born in any nation. Whether I am born in Haiti or the United States, I am still a human being, deserving of a basic right to earn myself a livelihood. Similarly, in either case, where I was born is outside of my control. I did not have any capacity to affect the decision of my mother to give birth to me in any given location. That decision was entirely outside of my control, as was both of my parents' decisions to acquire any citizenship in any given nation and thereby pass them on to me. One might argue that I can acquire new citizenships through applications, but these are not always possible for everyone, and the process of doing so would, by necessity, lead to a change in my identity. I shouldn't have to change my identity to have access to this fundamental right, no more than a woman would have to get transgender surgery for the same purpose. But I keep saying \"fundamental right.\" How truly fundamental is it? We can look to any number of sources. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states it plainly in Article 23.1.[1] The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is unequivocal as well, and this can be found in Part III, Article 6.[2] The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights agrees as well, in Article 15.[3] I think these all firmly establish the right to work (to be distinguished from \"right-to-work\" laws established in many states in the U.S., which prohibit unions requiring membership) quite clearly, and as long as this right exists, it must be extended to all adult, capable human beings, regardless of their sex, skin color, or citizenship. So what does it mean to deny this right? It's dehumanizing. Countries that engage in this practice are dehumanizing foreign peoples, denying their agency as individuals. The merits of these foreign persons are essentially subverted to their status a s foreign persons. It's part of a protectionist mindset where our goal is to ensure that more people in the U.S. get jobs while essentially stating that those who are foreign and just as, if not more, capable to perform those jobs should be denied access. It's arbitrary discrimination aimed at a goal that harms consumers (who are better served by more competition for jobs) for the sake of protecting work for individuals who would otherwise be outclassed by their foreign counterparts. That's not reason enough to treat others as less than human. 2. Human Decency Why would someone want to leave their home country and work in another nation, even without citizenship? There may be multiple answers to this question, but the two that come most prominently to mind are working conditions and higher income. In terms of working conditions, we could look at the obvious ones, like whether the industry adheres to internationally accepted labor practices, safe working conditions, and has unions to join, but there are a number of issues anyone takes into account with their choices that go deeper than that. People want to know if they have a chance at mobility, if their work provides assistance of sorts, how they motivate their workers, how well they deal with people of different cultures, what the environment looks like, how much interactivity there is between employees and supervisors, etc. There's a lot to be concerned with, whether it's the decision to escape a nation where businesses are engaging in dangerous practices, or they simply don't fit the set of preferences that potential employee has. Working for an employer who fits their preferences can also make them far more productive, and that increase in productivity as a result of expanding their job pool provides an increased opportunity that doesn't exist now. Then there's income inequality. There are massive inequities in what each country pays to people working the same jobs. \"the wages of a Peruvian worker willing to work in the United States are about 2.6 times as much as the same person would make in Peru. This figure for Peru is typical among the 42 developing countries analyzed, but for some it is much higher. For Filipino it is around 3.5, and for a Haitian it is over 7. In other words, a Nigerian moderately-educated adult male urban formal-sector wage worker who moves to the U.S. increases his wages by several hundred percent.\"[4] If you look at the paper in that link, you'll note that people in Nigeria working the same job will make 14.85 times less than their U.S. counterparts. The paper actually understates it. That's not several hundred percent. Considering how this directly relates to their ability to feed, house, and clothe themselves and their families, not to mention their capacities for contributing to the broader economies of their home nation and the nation in which they work, it's a big deal. 3. Diversity The idea of diversity is generally touted as important, but why? At its most basic level, this is meant to increase the creativity of a given workplace by providing a swell of different ideas, but why is that? Because different people from different countries are brought up in highly varied environments that breed a wide array of mindsets and ways of thinking/learning. But it goes beyond simply having more ideas. It forces groups to spend more time deliberating about their courses of action, engendering more constructive conflicts to ensure that each route taken is deliberated carefully, and is considered the most effective route to preventing Groupthink.[5] In a world with changing demographics, it's important to better understand existing and emerging markets. Companies have long understood the benefits of diversity and many have gone to great lengths to increase their diversity,[6] but policies that prevent foreign workers from applying effectively limit their progress. There are a lot of reasons why this is important to nations, but I'll focus on two. First of all, it forces nations to change their employment practices to garner the best employees from the broader economy. For nations that already have extensive laws supporting their labor force, this means improving on the formula and ensuring higher incomes, better benefits, etc. For nations that don't, pressure is placed on them to retain their best and draw new blood into their borders. Lacking that, they stand to lose the majority of their educated and better trained employees. Second, it's hugely beneficial for their economies. Economist Michael Clemens argues that \"total global GDP could double if all barriers to the free movement of labour were removed.\"[7][8] That's huge. We're talking about, on average, doubling the income of everyone on the planet. The reason why is actually pretty simple \" it is mostly the result of utilizing workers who are otherwise wasted in their places of origin. That kind of benefit comes especially to nations receiving foreign labor, and would likely expand labor markets as well, meaning that they companies could hire on more people.

We know the policies that lead to prosperity. Prosperity comes from accumulation of wealth, a willingness to take risk to achieve rewards, and free market by which investment can be expressed. Government acts to value prosperity when it's policies support savings, investment, and free markets. Prosperity can also derive from good fortune, like happening to have significant oil reserves, but our debate is about governments expressing values as policies, not about being lucky. We also know how to achieve economic equality with certainty. It is to take money away from investment and redistribute it. Governments can and do achieve equality through poverty, but prohibiting accumulation of wealth and investment. However, suppressing free markets and redistributing wealth is not as easy as it seems. Redistribution of wealth always involves a ruling class that controls the redistribution. So in North Korea there are perhaps 40,000 people who live well and about 24 million who share the equality of poverty. At root, this debate is about whether a ruling elite should be established to redistribute wealth according to what the elite values. We should not.The redistribution premise is wrongWhat is the motivation for wanting to redistribute wealth? The starting point is that people have a right to do as they wish: to save and invest in risky ventures or not, to spend their time managing risks or not, and to use their earnings as they see fit. So what is the grounds for interfering with the economic lives of individuals. Saying it's for fairness begs the question. In Monty Python skit, a Robin Hood character redistributes lupines, robbing lupines from the rich and giving them to the poor. The joke is that the robin Hood character believes that equal distribution of lupines is important. The people receiving lupines are perplexed.The premise of redistributing wealth is that happiness is proportional to wealth. Every liberal and most non-liberals believe that, but studies do not confirm the premise. The part that is true is that if people lack basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter then they are very unhappy. They get happier up to the point where their basic needs are met. Impoverished Zimbabwe under dictatorial rule is the saddest place on earth. But beyond the basics, added wealth produces very little increase in happiness.Many studies support this conclusion, Wikipedia summarizes \"Historically, economists have said that well-being is a simple function of income. However, it has been found that once wealth reaches a subsistence level, its effectiveness as a generator of well-being is greatly diminished.\" [6. http://en.wikipedia.org... supported y their ref 8]. Science Daily reports \"While most people believe that having more income would make them happier, Princeton University researchers have found that the link is greatly exaggerated and mostly an illusion.\" [7. http://tinyurl.com...]What is the most important in determining happiness? \"Of perhaps utmost importance, nearly all the nations in the top 10 are adept at fostering entrepreneurship and opportunity. Legatum\u2019s researchers concluded that a country\u2019s ranking in this area is the clearest proxy of its overall ranking in the index.\" [8. http://tinyurl.com...] Economic policy should therefore not be aimed at redistributing wealth to achieve economic equality. It should be aimed to raise as many people as possible above the level of satisfying basic needs. that is done through permitting free markets to operate and in fostering entrepreneurship.Forcing economic equality diminishes wealthThe Gini index is one measure of economic equality. It's applied to both incomes and to wealth. Let's look at income first. Con claims that equality of wealth correlates with prosperity. That's wrong because correlation does not prove causation. Dictatorial regimes concentrate wealth and control markets resulting in poverty. Free markets produce wealth by investing accumulated capital and produce prosperity. The proof lies in examining the economies of America, China, and India.According to Wikipedia [8. http://en.wikipedia.org...] the United States Gini Index for incomes was 45 in 1929. During the Depression, equality increased along with poverty, reaching 37.6 immediately after WWII. From 1947 to 1990, inequality increased slightly, rising to 42.6 in 1990. Poverty decreased. The booming 90s brought inequality to 46.2. Since 2000, inequality has been about the same, ending the decade at 46.8. In the U.S., unemployment and poverty declined during the 90s as inequality increased, and stayed about the same until the the onset of the current recession. [9. http://www.infoplease.com...] Overall, poverty rates have declined since the 1960s, while inequality increased. Unemployment mostly responds to short term recessions and booms. In other countries, the most interesting cases are China and India. They are the most interesting because the economies are large, and the policies with respect to inequality have changed significantly. India operated as a democratic socialist state until the past few decades, and while China remains authoritarian, they have abandoned communist economic ideals and permitted much more free market activity in the past. In both countries, inequality has risen significantly in the past few decades, and prosperity has risen dramatically. After WWII, famines plagued both India and China. Freeing markets produced a significant increase in living standards. People are much happier not facing famine than being equal in poverty.Small countries in Europe are generally not good examples because they are often dominated by special circumstances. Norway received major income from North Sea oil, producing increased prosperity. Sweden became prosperous with near-libertarian economic policies, and is now coasting in slow decline. Respected Swedish parliamentarian Johnny Munkhammar writes:\"\u2026Sweden is not socialist. According to the World Values Survey and other similar studies, Sweden combines one of the highest degrees of individualism in the world, solid trust in well-functioning institutions, and a high degree of social cohesion. Among the 160 countries studied in the Index of Economic Freedom, Sweden ranks 21st, and is one of the few countries that increased its economic freedoms during the financial crisis.\" [10. http://tinyurl.com...]Tiny Luxembourg has an unusual economic situation from specialization in international banking and exotic steel making. I see nothing about any efforts to redistribute wealth. [11. http://tinyurl.com...]The Gini Index for wealth is more interesting that the Index for income. What's interesting is the seemingly random relationship between concentration of wealth. [12. http://tinyurl.com...] Rich countries like Denmark (.808) and the USA (.801)have high concentrations of wealth, but so do some of the poorest countries like Namibia (.847) and Zimbabwe (.845). Some countries with low concentrations of wealth are well off. like Japan (.547) and others are relatively poor, like China (.550). What counts is how much wealth is invested. The Japanese have extraordinarily high personal savings rates, from which they derive investment. Third world dictators are accumulating wealth but not investing it.Policies should be directed at prosperityRedistribution of wealth does not raise people out of poverty, prosperity achieved through free markets does. Free markets can stand fairly heavy taxation, but they clearly succeed in spite of that, not because of it. Economic policy should aim to raise people out of poverty, through free markets.

Critical thinking employs good judgment, context, and competency in making a decision (in this case, whether or not we should have progressive taxation) - especially a decision which huge implications that concerns the economy. Critical thinking takes into account not only efficiency, but equity and morality as well. Is it efficient to kill every murderer that is guilty after being convicted so we dont have to house them in jail? yes. Is it moral? No. Also, it is not up to you to declare who has already won the debate - it is up to the voters. Equity: I am talking about income taxes. Who starts a corporation? A person at one point who starts the business. How do they start this business? With an income. The income he uses to start the business is separate from the corporate tax rate. People who are born into rich families inherit a monetary. Also, I see that your shallow reply to my key points show that you don't understand the concept at all. Moral reason: there is a moral implication involved in tax rates. Let me set an extreme example for you: Everyone gets taxed at 99% of their income. Would this be moral? No. Who would be able to survive? The richest 1% would still be able to buy basic necessities but neither the middle or lower class would. This is the same fundamental concept of morality in the income tax rate: Those who earn millions, should pay more in taxes than someone that lives in poverty. To say morality doesn't apply to the income tax rate is simply wrong. The point in mentioning the China example is that they were using capitalism focusing solely on economic growth (as you do) and it created numerous problems for the well-being of those living in China so it also would in America. Well-being is the central focus here: just because lowering taxes on the rich would spur economic growth, doesn't mean it's in the best interest of the majority of people within that economy. The point in mentioning the environment, is that it is simply an exploitable resource in the eyes of capitalism. Taxes help to support national parks and the preservation of the environment - funding helped by a progressive tax rate.

Content: I affirm, resolved, governments have an obligation to lessen the economic gap between its rich and poor citizens. Government: the political direction and control exercised over the actions of the members, citizens, or inhabitants of communities, societies, and states; Obligation: something by which a person is bound or obliged to do certain things, and which arises out of a sense of duty or results from custom, law, etc. Economic gap: A wide divergence, difference, or disparity pertaining to the production, distribution, and use of income wealth, and commodities. Rich: having wealth or great possessions; abundantly supplied with resources, means, or funds Poor: having little or no money, goods, or other means of support Value: Legitimacy of government. This is the correct value for this round because the main purpose of a government is to protect its people by adhering to a set of obligations with the basic aim of protecting its people. If a government does not fulfill these obligations, they would be illegitimate, taking advantage of its people and not doing the things that the government was created to do. An illegitimate government would not be concerned with its obligations to its people. Thus, the resolution, in asking whether something is an obligation to the government, mandates this value of legitimacy of government because, if it were an obligation, it would be one in order to make a government legitimate. Value Criterion: Protecting the rights of the poor. I define human rights with those listed in the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It claims that everyone has the right to equality, life liberty, security of person, equality before the law, free speech, dignity, a healthy standard of living and education. It also declares that people will always have duties to the community set forth to protect the rights of others, so long as those people's rights are still recognized. Protecting the rights of the poor is important as a value criterion because the only way a government could be deemed legitimate is if it adheres to obligations to protect the rights of the poor, as I will argue in my case. Obligations should be demanded to make sure that the poor have the aforementioned rights protected. Thus, the rights of the individual are the correct value criterion for this round. Contention 1: The existence of a large economic gap between the rich and poor violates a representative government, which in turn violates the individuals' rights to equality, fairness, and justice. Representative government is when the people of a country are represented in the government and its decisions. Absence of a representative government would jeopardize all human rights, because there would be no provision for fairness, equality, or justice. This is exactly what happens when income inequality is allowed to take over. Rich citizens make it so that the voices of the poor cannot be heard. Hunter Lewis, in his book Are The Rich Necessary?, explains how the rich can use their money to gain influence in this country, stamping out the wishes of the rest and annulling the justice and fairness which the government should be trying to preserve. \"The problem in a nutshell is that one cannot have a politically representative government without an economy which represents everyone. The two go hand in hand, together represent a completely representative system, this is exactly what we need\u2026 Yet capitalism proceeds on the contrary notion of one dollar, one vote, which means that rich people have a very disproportionate say. One person, one vote, and one dollar, one vote, are obviously incompatible notions. Incompatibility breeds tension, and the tension can only be relieved by abandoning a representative government or by making wealth more equal, so that people have more equivalent numbers of dollars.\" The outnumbering of rich people's money to the money of the poor makes it so that the poor have an extremely smaller voice in the government simply because they can buy more things, know more people, and get more influence. The economy and the government go hand in hand, so when one is unequal, the other is bound to be. Poor people cannot achieve major elected positions since they lack influence. Many homeless people cannot even vote. It is not fair to have a government where more money means more power, so in order for the government to protect equality and justice and be legitimate, they must reduce the income gap. Contention 2: Inequality between the rich and poor violates the most basic individual rights for the poor and rich alike. Sub-Point A: A capitalist society based on social class, competition, and subordination violates almost all of the rights of the individual. In their book The Spirit Level, Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett explain how people's obsession with competition and economic growth end up making everyone unhappy. They claim that we are led to discriminate and not trust one another based on class differences, just the same as we used to do these things based on gender or race. The authors claim that humans are automatically programmed to cooperate, trust each other, and issue fairness, so evident social strains are caused by inequality, inferiority, and social exclusion. They also showed how these social strains lead rich and poor people alike to mental instability through the pressure of living in a competitive society, and how rates of violence, prisoners, obesity, education, and teenage birth are all negatively affected by the strains put forward by our society to compete in the economy and deal with their economic positions, rich or poor. Good health, or the right to life, a well as fairness and the pursuit of happiness are all invaluable rights of the individual. Since capitalism creates loss of all of these things, and a more egalitarian society would help people to be happier, healthier, and live more fairly by giving everyone equal opportunity, it is the government's responsibility to lessen the economic gap between the rich and the poor. Otherwise, it would not be doing a good job of protecting people's rights. Sub-Point B: The very existence of poverty means the stripping away all of the most basic human rights. In her book The Unheard Truth, Irene Khan explains how poverty is not just a matter of people lacking money, but a human rights crisis. People in poverty lack the rights to freedom of speech, freedom from discrimination, and the rights to safety, health, protection, and liberty which people would normally have if their government was legitimate. They cannot speak freely as they are often ignored by the government and denied the information to improve their situation. The poor are discriminated against and denied the equality and freedom from discrimination that our country sees as one of the most important human rights. Poor people are also denied the basic human rights of safety and healthcare, since they often do not have enough money to contact authorities or the doctors if they are in danger. They are also denied freedom in any form since they have no way to improve their situation enough to join the middle class. She quotes Muhammad Yunus in saying that \"Because poverty denies people any semblance of control over their destiny, it is the ultimate denial of human rights.\" Therefore, in order to protect the rights of the individual the government must reduce the economic gap between its rich and poor citizens.", "qid": 50, "docid": "424f314-2019-04-18T18:14:55Z-00003-000", "score": 7.76039981842041}, {"content": "Title: Replace Welfare with the Negative Income Tax Content: Conflict of interest: Government as Charitable Organization \"The biggest problem with government doing the job of long-term charity to its citizens, especially in a system with elected officials, is that it becomes a conflict of interest. Our representatives seek to get themselves reelected. If increasing the amount of taxpayer funds going to people increases the number of votes from the beneficiaries in that district, that could be a huge temptation to an official. The simple and well constructed NIT would quickly be corrupted, just as many other programs have been mutated into payouts for special interests and vote buying. The changes over the years to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and US Farm Bills are prime examples.\" Skynet brings up a legitimate issue with government assistance to the poor. It is true that the NIT would be subject to special interests attempting to increase or decrease the amount of money the NIT gives to the poor. In response to this criticism, I assert that the NIT would be less subject to these changes by special interests. The negative income tax is basically a modification of the federal income tax system. The federal income tax system is not as vulnerable to bloated, pork-barrel spending and adjustments by politicians to help their specific districts when compared to the welfare system. The 126 federal welfare programs, in contrast, are very much up to variations by people to benefit in specific ways. In total, yes it could be effected and changed over time, but it is much harder and far less vulnerable to these modifications when compared to the current system. Equity to the Providers Skynet brings up an argument that the NIT is not fair because the funds would \"come almost exclusively from people who do not partake of the system, and it's not voluntary.\" The problem with this idea is it can be extended to the idea that taxation is never justified without the consent by each individual. Skynet claims that \"It's reasonable to pay for fire and police protection, public services like national defense, reasonable public servant's wages, public roads, and maybe even some other programs he does benefit from.\" What may be reasonable to you may be completely unreasonable to someone else who pays taxes. For example, an man may not want to subscribe to the police protection system, and would rather defend his property himself or hire private security. It's still involuntary and therefore it isn't justified to force him to pay for something he doesn't want. The truth is, taxation is a necessary evil. There will always be things that the government ought to use resources for in order to maintain a prosperous, free society. Things like national defense, the court system, infrastructure, education, and a social safety net can be justifiably funded through taxpayer money so long as they increase the net freedom, well being, and prosperity of the general populace. \"But paying to raise another man's family? That's not equitable, when this young man is taking nothing, and trying to provide for his own future family. It's far more equitable for each person to pay for themselves and thier own family.\" It's a balancing of freedoms. Yes, a man may not want to pay for another man's family. Yes, involuntarily paying for it may decrease his own freedom. But what if not paying for someone else through taxes causes the ability of someone else to have the opportunity to succeed in life decrease to nearly zero? Is it truly a fair system when one does not have enough resources to eat, have shelter, receive an education, and begin to be self-sufficient later in one's life? America ought to be a land of opportunity. Some people have very little opportunity to exit their current adverse circumstances and become successful in life. If the private market can't provide this opportunity better than government, then this is one thing the government should provide. The negative income tax is the most fair, efficient, and cheapest way to go about providing people enough resources to live and have a chance to get on their feet. Supporting Private Charity My opponent supports the use of private charity to help the poor. I do as well. In fact, I would also support the advancement of private charity through tax credits. He claims that private charity is more efficient and generally better than government assistance. I agree with this. The problem is private charity doesn't guarantee assistance to every person, and so the government needs to help those that don't get helped by others Should We Let People Starve? \"Should children go hungry? No!\" If you don't think children should go hungry, then it sounds like you would support government assistance to poor children if they aren't being helped through private charity. Would you then support a welfare system for at least children? \"But should adults who don't work or make stupid mistakes that cause them to loose their jobs or not advance be given incentive to not make those mistakes? Yes.\" Not everyone who lost their jobs in the Great Depression were at fault. Forces completely outside their control caused the economy to decline, businesses to close, and hence jobs to be lost. It's not a stupid mistake by them that caused them to go unemployed and no longer able to support themselves or their families. In circumstances like these, it makes sense for there to be some type of system to alleviate poverty and misery through government assistance. \" It's called learning through trial and error, and it's one of the best and most memorable learning tools. Being hungry incentivizes the worker.\" It's misguided to think that it's simply error that causes people to lose their jobs. Nobody was able to predict what was going to happen. There was nothing to learn that could have prevented so many people from losing their jobs. Hunger could be an incentive to work, but it would be pointless to have people go hungry if there really is not enough jobs to fully employ everyone. And there really wasn't enough jobs at the time. \"if someone wants to learn to fish, I'll give him a few free ones, but the rest he must catch on his own\". Life is not that simple today. Learning skills doesn't guarantee that there will be a job opening for someone with that skill. The world changes and is unpredictable. What was once a popular job may be completely replaced by a new technological breakthrough. There needs to be a system to allow those that can't find a way to support themselves to have the means to survive until they can support themselves. \"If someone absolutely cannot take care of themselves through no fault of their own, and have no family, that is the time for true compassion and generocity by the willing, not bueraucratic handouts pulled by force of law from the working class.\" You and I both know that compassion and private charity has never been efficient and perfect enough to guarantee help to every person with such circumstances. In a utopia, idealistic society, it would be and I would fully support this idea. But in reality, the only way to ensure everyone has enough resources to live is through government. Political Feasibility Skynet, you have stated that \"NIT is better than our current system, but history and human nature strongly indicates it will be corrupted quickly.\" If you truly believe that that NIT is better than the current system, then I have a proposition for you. The current political landscape basically guarantees that there will be a system to help the poor. Your desire for welfare being ended and having no more government assistance to the poor is idealistic and infeasible. As you said, politicians get elected for the specific purpose of guaranteeing benefits to their constituents. Because of this, it would make sense for you to call for a compromise. The current political landscape could indeed support a smaller, cheaper, more efficient, more fair system to help the poor. The negative income tax is much more politically feasible than your idea of ending welfare entirely. If you think that the size of government should be decreased and taxation should be decreased, you should support the negative income tax. This is a system that trends toward your goals, even if it doesn't accomplish them entirely.

In case my opponent has not yet grasped this truth, I will attempt to explain it once more. Basically, outsourcing is where governments the contracts to other places, so they don't have to do the work. As the market is highly competitive, these private firms offer lower and lower wages, so the government doesn't have to spend so much money. As a result, people work from little to nothing with current wages. However, these people wouldn't even be in the contract work situation had their jobs payed enough to sustain them. With more money in their pockets, they don't have to search for work that promises high wages but then pays nothing. Instead, they will be able to support themselves with a job.

However, it can also better supply free market and free trade between country because of the heightened money flow I explained earlier.Point B2: \"15,580 dollars a year is enough for one person and if you have a family of three there is likely two incomes \"I would first like to point out that my opponent repeatedly describes low-wage workers with words such as \"lazy\" and \"lethargic,\" both of which are stereotypical and disrespectful. Regardless, I will attack his/her points just the same. My opponent claims that 15k is enough for one person, and a family, because \"there is likely two incomes.\" However, most of the time, they cannot get two jobs, especially for single mother's with two kids. Once again, my opponent stereotypes the situation. However, single mothers cannot get two jobs that pay enough to support her family and take care of her children with adequate time. Furthermore, this mother cannot be lazy or lethargic if she intends to survive. Because these situations are prevalent, we need to compensate for these problems by raising wages and providing sufficient funds for individuals in need. Working, in basically any form, is earning of a living income. Point C2: \"College can result in a better job and many people are seeking college loans which would be a practical means of getting a real job that will actually give back to the economy.\"My opponent basically says that everyone should go to college. I would more or less agree with this. However, total agreement with this assumes the premise that everyone can afford college. This premise doesn't exist, becuase not everyone can afford college. But calling the people who cannot afford it lazy and greedy as my opponent does is simply wrong. Furthermore, a burger-flipping job is an honest job, one that a young or unskilled worker should be proud of. Discriminating and bashing these individuals just because they cannot afford college to receive the necessary skill for a \"better\" job is immoral. Furthermore, not all students are eligible for the scholarships. Beyond this, fast food workers can benefit the populace by providing food for people to eat at a cheap price.Point D2: \"If you want to \"ensure a quality job\" you should go to college and get the job that deserves the higher wage.\"This is once again undert he assumed premise that people can afford college. The simply fact is that poverty exists, and until that is solved, college isn't always an option. Thus, we must allow those people who can't afford college have two things: a job, and secondly a pay that will suffice for survival and basic needs. Without raising the minimum wage, neither of these things can be achieved in a utilitarian facet. Furthermore, as I have explained time and again, stereotyping fast food workers as lazy is immoral, wrong, and disrespectful. In reality, these individuals are just trying to live life, which they should be allowed. In regards to risk taking, there is always potential danger. By raising wages, we not only give the person enough money to sustain, but decimate the chance of danger or harm.Point E: \"My opponent says I refuse to argue the points...\"First of all, he has still not directly attacked any points, but simply generalized a reason why we should not raise the wages. Secondly, my opponent concedes that higher wages ensure quality jobs. However, if \"burger-flipping\" is the only job you can get, then so be it. Individuals are deserving of pay if they do any work or service for society that benefits society. This, fast food chains do, by providing quick, cheap, and delicious food for citizens. My opponent's next claim is logically contradictory. He continually bashes fast food chains and their supposed worthlessness, but then brings up a success story of dedication and motivation from McDonald's. This contradicts his ideals that fast food chains are \"worthless,\" \"lazy,\" and \"lethargic.\" Instead, he contradicts his points by representing part of McDonald's as \"driven\" and \"dedicated.\" Thus, this point has been refuted by both myself and my opponent. Lastly, my opponent asks me to respond to outsourcing, and claims that I have yet to do so. However, besides this round, I mentioned it in my original case and in argument three of his point D in round. Thereby this claim falls without merit, as the point has been successfully refuted.Conclusively, we see that all of my opponent's points have been refuted, and points of mine still stand, as my opponent has not directly attacked any of these points. They include the following:1. A living wage hosts vital economic benefits.a. Living wages bolster the economy and doesn't result in unemployment.b. Higher wages ensure quality jobs2. Inflation is not a reasonable counter to higher wages.3. Higher wages will uphold societal welfare and is pragmatic.", "qid": 50, "docid": "4c9dc9d3-2019-04-18T15:00:27Z-00000-000", "score": 7.725500106811523}, {"content": "Title: resolved: In the United States, current income disparities threaten democratic ideals Content: Some unexpected business came up. ==Rebuttals==PRO says \"My partner first addresses life and he/she is saying that there are public institutions and public hospitals and even the fact that the government cannot take all these away from the people. Lets look at some government institutions/orders/rules. For example, affirmative action gives priority to certain races over others when applying to colleges. Sure this is promoting the democratic ideal of diversity, but now we are taking away democracy. Other institutions require some type of qualification. \" 1) Student loans. .. Without the government, there would be no such thing as student loans, since students often have no collateral or credit history. This poses too much of a risk for banks, but our government has somewhat \"co-signed\" with the students to get the loans. This process happens by the government guaranteeing that the student will pay off the debt, as he/she cannot file bankruptcy.2)Affirmative actions doesn't neccessarly mean prioritizing one group, but rather policies that take factors including race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or national origin. I don't see how we are taking away democracy, as everyone promotes diversity and against discrimination. 3) \"Some type of qualification. \" Every student belongs at a certain school. .. Elite schools would be too hard and useless for those in need of more basic education, and genius students will have nothing to do at normal schools. Qualifications are used to make sure that the student is right for that school. Pro says, \"If everyone was entitled to money from the government then there would not be so many people on the streets as we see today. Even then government support does barely nothing to ensure equality among the citizens. \"1) There are local organizations that provide a range of services, including shelter, food, counseling, and jobs skills programs. 2) Food banks exist to feed those in need.3) Since the 1950s, the US government has passed many laws to ensure equality between whites and blacks. . http://www.scholastic.com...4) Our government and we as a society ensure that criminals do not go unpunished.5) The 13th Amendment, passed in 1865, banned slavery. The 14th Amendment, passed in 1868, guaranteed equal rights of citizenship to all Americans, including women and former slaves. The 15th Amendment (1870) provided that voting rights of citizens \u201cshall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\". Pro says, \"My opponents states that the government cannot takes rights away from people, he is right, however, the fact is, in reality, the effect or leeway of these rights are more noticeable and correlate with the amount of money one has. Even hospitals, they are only legally obligated to treat you if emergency, after that if you don't have good any insurance then they can send you home. You could be dying of a cancer that they can sure, but if you don`t have proper insurance than they just send you home with \"what to do with the rest of your life\" pamphlet. And thus that point would reside with me, because of income disparity different people are given different healthcare and then possibly have unequal chances of living. \"1) Several rights have nothing to do with the amount of money you make, such as the right to vote or the right to a trial.2) A public/government hospital is a hospital which is owned by a government and receives government funding. This type of hospital provides medical care free of charge, and this is covered by the funding the hospital receives. Poor uninsured patients receive their care for free. 3) Life-sustaining treatment and organizations that specifically research cures for cancer exist to help those with cancer. Whether or not they are rich, those with terminal diseases cannot be saved with current technology. I fail to see how money can cure diseases that have no cures. PRO says, \"Moving on to liberty, they say that the government cant deprive you of freedom and everyone is given the exact same rights. This is true, however, again, because of this income disparity, certain people have a harder time executing these rights in a from to their pleasing. For example the article released form Princeton University specifically states how the rich are given more of a say. This shows how the rich can properly voice their opinion in the government as opposed to those with lower income. \"1) First off, I'd like to mention that \"voicing your opinion\" has nothing to do with \"freedom\". Everyone has the power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants without hindrance or restraint.2) Now, there are some possibilities on how the rich can have a bigger voice. a) The Rich have better capabilities and more political power. b) The government benefits and prefers the rich over the poor/middle classes. Addressing point \"A\". ..1) Cantidates have \"spending limits\" on states. Here a the list of the spending limits for each state: . http://www.fec.gov...2) Public funding of Presidential elections means that qualified Presidential candidates receive federal government funds to pay for the valid expenses of their political campaigns in both the primary and general elections. Addressing point \"B\". .. .1) The top contributors for each presidential cantidate is made public and for everyone to see. If there is corruption going on, then it would already be pointed out.2) Everyone has limits on how much they can donate. This prevents people from trying to gain favors from cantidates. . http://www.fec.gov...;3) Secret ballots currently help prevent cantidates from bribing people to vote for them, as the cantidate cannot know for sure whether or not they are voting for him/her. PRO says \"My opponent then talks about the pursuit of happiness. Sure no everyone is guaranteeing it, but because of income disparity most people cannot. This pursuit of happiness should be encouraged by the government but is hindered but the lack of income. They then say we have an education system and a health system that help people succeed. Well that may be the case, but then again not all schools are equal and a lot of schools have are in bad neighborhoods and are not properly funded. In terms of health care, government paid health care does not cover most things, just items such as immediate care and medication. that's it. As i said before. \"1) I only need to provide an example of people reaching \"happiness\", even though they are poor. One example is Bill Clinton and Lincoln. Happiness is defined as the state of being delighted, pleased, or glad. Just because you are poor, it doesn't mean that you cannot express human emotions, or that you cannot make friends. Pro says \"They then talk about political rights and equality. Well, yes everyone is given the same rights, but again the ability to perform these rights is hindered by income. Th effectiveness of these rights in government is hindered as said before. New York time columnist and economist stated that people are given unequal shares in the government, and these \"shares\" are based on income. \" 1) How, in any way, can exercising rights be stopped because of income levels? You can choose whether or not to exercise them, but they are not being prevented from you.2. PRO talks about \"Unequal shares\", but I've already stated before about how you cannot gain the benefit of the government.3) Representives are elected through majority vote. The rich are not the majority of America, but rather the poor and the middle classes. Pro says that people don't necessarly receive enough food.

Respecting human worth is the most important and fundamental condition of a just society, Arneson writes. Several issues arise in considering Cohen versus Rawls. According to Rawls, a just society is a fair scheme of cooperation among persons regarded as free and equal. Each is free in having the ability and the right to develop and pursue a conception of the good and also the ability and the disposition to cooperate with others on fair terms. In any modern, diverse society that refrains from clearly unacceptable restriction of freedom, individuals will develop allegiance to different and opposed conceptions of the right and the good, and a conception of justice that can elicit everyone's reasonable acceptance must be acceptable to the different reasonable ethical views that individuals espouse. The moral equality of persons generates this unanimity requirement. To satisfy this requirement, a justice doctrine must be built up from ideas deeply embedded in the culture of modern democracies. To enable satisfaction of this requirement, reasonable citizens do not press as justice norms controversial, sectarian doctrines that some cannot reasonably accept. When we act together as citizens through the state, we act on the basis of shared reasons, a common ideal of justice. But each of us has different ultimate ethical allegiances, and no single idea of what demands morality places on us to promote justice in our private conduct will make sense to all of us. Moreover, it would be a form of tyranny to require that we generally act only on the shared reasons of justice throughout our lives rather than on the aims and ambitions that are uniquely our own. In a just society, individuals in their daily lives will decide from their own individual ethical perspectives what goals to pursue, including justice goals, within constraints set by the rights of others. There is no social consensus on this issue, so no particular view of the demands of justice promotion in ordinary life will be part of a conception of justice that all can accept (see generally Rawls 2005)\" Egalitarian justice doctrines [which] rests on the fundamental premise that all persons have the same fundamental worth and dignity, which command[ing]s respect. An aristocratic doctrine that held that all lords are inherently superior to commoners and hence ought to have greater rights and privileges would reject the basic equal human worth premise. Therefore, the value criterion is respecting human worth. Prefer my value criterion additionally because all other ethical theories pre-suppose respecting human worth as the ultimate goal. Contention 1 The living wage is counterproductive. First, a living wage would cause an increase in the price of goods and services, Tolley writes. Previous studies of the impact of higher wages show that higher prices are definitely one result. According to Kevin Murphy, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, one effect of an increase in the minimum wage is that \"all of those whose wages and income are not increased by the minimum will be worse off, as the higher minimum raises employers\" costs and the ultimate prices of products.\"6 The same conclusion was obtained from a study of New Jersey fast-food restaurants by economists David Card and Alan Krueger. Card and Krueger found that the price of meals at these restaurants increased when the state of New Jersey increased its minimum wage from $4.25/hour to $5.05/hour.7 Interestingly, price increases occurred at firms that previously paid most of their workers $4.25/ hour (direct cost-pass-through effect) and at firms that previously paid most of their workers at least $5.05/hour (indirect cost-passthrough effect). In other words, firms that did not experience much of an increase in costs as a result of the higher wage still raised their prices because their competitors also faced an increase in costs. This means if we affirm any reduction in poverty is destroyed by inflation - people can\"t afford any more than they could before and the economy suffers. Second, this drop in employment is factually proven, not just speculative, Lammam writes. As economic theory would predict and consistent with the broader research on minimum wage legislation, Professors Neumark and Adams find that living wage laws generally result in less employment for people at the lower end of the wage distribution. When looking at all living wage laws without discriminating by type, Neumark and Adams find that a 100% increase in the living wage (say going from a minimum wage of $10 per hour to a living wage of $20 per hour) reduces employment among low-wage workers by 12% and the impact is statistically significant. When looking at the separate effects of contractor-only and business-assistance living wage laws, they find a stronger adverse and statistically significant impact from the latter\"likely because of the wider coverage. Specifically, a 100% increase in business-assistance living wage laws results in a 17% decline in employment. Indeed, the adverse employment effects of living wage laws seem to become more prominent as the laws cover a larger group.\" Other researchers have also found that living wages adversely affect employment. For instances, University of Kentucky economist Aaron Yelowitz (2005) examined the effects of Santa Fe\"s living wage laws increased municipalities in New Mexico. He found that living wage laws increased Santa Fe\"s unemployment rate by 3.2 percentage points and decreased the number of hours worked by those who remained employed by an average of 1.6 hours per week. This means that the affirmative will throw countless people into deeper poverty because they have literally no means of supporting themselves. Contention 2 minimum wage increases leads to exclusion of minority groups, First, living wage furthers the gender wage gap, the facts say so , Middlesteadt writes. The Census Bureau began keeping track of poverty by gender in 1966. Since then the Minimum Wage was hiked 16 times. In 11 of those instances (69%) the percentage of women in poverty went UP after the hike. In absolute terms it appears that women do worse when the Minimum Wage goes up, but the \"gender wage gap\" is a relative comparison, not absolute. Did women do better (actually, did they do less worse) than men? We have another coin flip. Half the time women fared better when the wage was raised, but half the time the men did. It\"s a wash. There\"s no evidence that raising the MW will close the gender wage gap. Second, living wage\"s racist policy results in more poverty for African Americans, Middlesteadt writes. As with gender, the Census Bureau began breaking out poverty statistics by race in 1966. 9 of the 16 wage hikes (56%) since then saw the percentage of blacks in poverty go up. When we look at unemployment statistics below, the data will give a clue as to why this happens. But you can\"t say raising the bottom wage will create racial justice if the historically most oppressed race does worse over half the time when the wage goes up. Contention 3 is that there are better alternatives to a living wage. Other alternatives instead of a living wage exist, and are more effective at reducing poverty levels. One example is providing a basic income instead of a living wage; Hiebert clarifies. The idea behind basic income is to provide a floor of income upon which people can build other sources of revenue. Each month, every man, woman, and child would receive a check for a certain amount that should cover their basic needs. This amount would be non-taxable, but any income earned in addition to it would [be taxed]. And, in the places basic income has been implement it has achieved its goal of reducing poverty and providing other benefits, Lowrey writes. The left is more concerned with the power of a minimum or basic income as an anti-poverty and pro-mobility tool. There happens to be some hard evidence to bolster the policy\"s case. In the mid-1970s, the tiny Canadian town of Dauphin ( the \"garden capital of Manitoba\" ) acted as guinea pig for a grand experiment in social policy called \"Mincome.\" For a short period of time, all the residents of the town received a guaranteed minimum income. About 1,000 poor families got monthly checks to supplement their earnings. Evelyn Forget, a health economist at the University of Manitoba, has done some of the best research on the results. Some of her findings were obvious: Poverty disappeared. But others were more surprising: High-school completion rates went up; hospitalization rates went down. \"If you have a social program like this, community values themselves start to change,\" Forget said.

All tax revenue not used for defense, law enforcement, and public infrastructure should be invested, and the returns distributed to the citizens Thorium reactors have several advantages over traditional U-235 reactors: 1. Ease of fuel reprocessing 2. Unable to be used for nuclear weapons 3. 4x energy density Thorium can produce around 11 GWh/kg, and an ERoEI of 800-1600. The USA has around 400 million kg of thorium reserves. So we can produce almost 4 exawatt-hours/year of electricity if we used all of it. http://energyfromthorium.com... Under the electricity-backed currency regime which I recommend (http://www.energybackedmoney.com...) the price of electricity would hover around an average price of $0.125/kWh, 1 kg of thorium would be worth $1,375,000. The total value of our thorium reserves would be nearly $500 TRILLION. Every good and service produced would be required to list the energy used in it's production. All energy commodities would be priced per kWh, and specified in kWh, instead of by weight or volume. The development of micro-LFTRs will be encouraged to power road vehicles and aircraft, while ships will be powered by computerized sails, solar power, and LFTRs. CVTs would be required, because LFTRs aren't throttleable. Human excrement should be composted and used as fertilizer, and forests should be coppiced and some of the cut-off branches should be buried and overplanted to prevent soil erosion. Geothermal energy should be used for heating and cooling. This will help provide sustainable agriculture and residential living. With a land value tax of 2.5%, over $12.5 trillion of tax revenue would be raised every year, and employees and businesses would be able to keep more of their wages since there will be no income or payroll tax. Also, by paying every employee partly in shares of their employer, the employees will be able to share in their employer's profits. Having a law saying that C-level employees can only have total compensation that is at maximum 10x the lowest-paid employee's annual wages would also help reduce income inequality. The government should only spend half of it's tax revenue, and that should only be spent on law enforcement, defense, and public infrastructure. And since a little over 9 million kg of thorium must be mined and sold to power companies every year to pay for the tax, we'd produce almost 100 PWh/year of electricity, which is almost four times the amount of electricity we use. The rest could be exported. The government could then place the other $6.25 trillion in revenue into a trust fund, with the trustee being a successful global financier, the trustor being the United States of America, and the beneficiary being every citizen of the USA. If the financier also makes wise investments in foreign businesses, securities, and sovereign debt, we'll pretty much own the rest of the world as well. The financier takes a management fee of 2% of assets under management, and 20% of all profits that exceed the S&P 500 return. After seven years, the trust fund will have almost $70 trillion, and will pay out 80% of the net returns to the citizens (you can't pay out all of the returns, or else the trust fund will slowly erode in value). If the trustee can earn an average annual return of 15%, every citizen will receive a dividend of around $26,000 from then on, which should increase every year. Doctors and dentists should charge a retainer fee of 10% of the annual dividend the patients they sign up receive, and should be limited to 400 patients total. Doctors and dentists should be required to pay 10% of the fees they collect into a mutual malpractice fund, and 20% into a fund that builds and operates hospitals. 10% of everyone's annual dividend should go to funding no-additional cost public education at elementary, secondary, and university levels.

Content: \"I said it raises taxes beyond the necessary limit. Read my post next time, don't skim it. As I said, just paying for 10% of the population causes much less of an increase in taxes, so we should do that instead.\" Same to you - I can still apply the same argument to that. What if your \"limit\" of taxes has been reached, and the government decides it needs some minor funding for a highway project? Then the taxes will have been raised beyond the \"necessary limit\". I could go on with many different examples, so you see my point; you can't say this is a consequence of just health care. \"Typo, smart one...\" I realized that obviously... \"Because Johnny can get the health care plan he wants rather than the one the government wants. That's why I emphasized monetarily. I was showing that Johnny doesn't need or want universal health care for himself.\" OK, so Johnny wants a better health plan than Bobby, so he gets it. Bobby wants it too, but he can't have it, because he's broke. How do you think Bobby feels? According to this whole \"equal rights\" thing we've been talking about, Bobby deserves the same health care as Johnny. So why shouldn't he get it? Especially if he was born into a position where he can't change his situation easily. \"Okay, so the government should also choose what we wear so we don't have to decide that either. Also, it should choose what we eat, drink, buy, do et cetera. I definitely want the government making all my decisions for me. My point is is that Johnny can get the plan that fits his needs, or even get a free plan from his job, rather than paying high taxes to get government health care.\" I'm not saying the government should make decisions for us, you're over exaggerating it. I'm saying that we should all use one health plan, that covers common problems. Any additional problems can be given by his job, like he said. But basic needs should be given to all people. In fact, this way, since not as many things will be covered by a universal health plan (for example, uncommon things like tornadoes will not be included, but common things like surgery will be), it won't cost as much. Add in the fact that only 10% of the people will get the benefit and it will not monetarily affect the rest, and it's not that bad of a tax raise. \"Since you can't comprehend the English language, we may have a problem. I meant they don't need the government to give them health care. Jack and Johnny both don't need government health care, Bobby does, give it to Bobby, and let Jack and Johnny pay lower taxes and get free health care from their jobs, or get health care that pays for spa treatments. My plan has more pros than yours.\" Well I do have a C or D in English...damnit! XD Oh well, back to the debate. Fine, I'll list the Pros and Cons of each plan. Pros of Universal: + everyone gets it Cons: - tax increase Pros of Non-universal: + no tax increase His plan doesn't have more Pros, but it has less Cons. However, let's analyze it further for a minute. His main benefit is that Bobby will get his free health care, while Johnny's is supplied by his job and covers his specific needs. Now, in a universal plan, everyone gets basic needs, and nobody would get specific benefits. However, Johnny's job can give him the extra benefits he needs. So instead of the job having the burden of providing ALL health care benefits, it only needs to provide the ones specific to that job. Also, everyone starts with an equal amount of health care (equal rights). So in a universal plan, less pressure is put on specific jobs, and everyone starts with equal protection. The only \"problem\" is a tax increase. However, it can be worked into the budget in place of something else to even it out. \"Okay, first, just because it isn't in the Constitution does not mean it isn't a right. Second, you need a stable economy in order to allow people to effectively use their rights. Without a stable economy we fall into a state of nature like situation, and people aren't happy.\" Exactly. That's why one of the purposes of government is to stabilize the economy. But a stable economy cannot be compared to free speech for example; free speech is a fundamental right that cannot be limited. Economic stability, however, is just necessary to establishing good living conditions. It makes life good. It's not like the government doing a bad job with the economy would be taking away a right; it'd just be a bad government. \"That's not what I said. I said that Johnny, if his job does not provide him with free health care, pays the same whether he has universal health care, or whether he is buying health care for himself under my plan. What happens is that people like Jack end up paying the same in a universal system as they did when they bought their own health insurance, but they are getting much less. What's the point of that?\" Like I suggested earlier this argument, the job can provide any extra benefits Jack needs. He already gets common protections, though. So they are not getting less. And Bobby is getting more. That's the point of it. And for the record, your example sucks; why would you get free spa treatment with your health insurance? lol \"Jack would rather buy his friggin' sweet health care plan than pay obscene taxes so that he gets free health care that isn't anywhere nearly as sweet\" No, he would get the basic health care from the government, and then his job would give him the friggin' sweet part. So what he doesn't pay out normally (the unsweet part) would go back in taxes. No gain, no loss. Sweet enough? \"So that also means that we must have equal houses, but rich people have to pay more for them? Sounds real fair to me.\" Did you notice that people who pay more for their houses, have bigger houses? Maybe that's why they pay so much. Rich people pay more, because they get more. Vote Pro because: 1. I have shown why universal health care does not mean paying more and getting less. 2.

Rich people become rich through their own work. With their wealth, they might buy an expensive house and car, which benefits home and car dealers. If they hire gardener or cleaning person, then that person benefits. If they are a major CEO of a large corporation, then the money they make also goes to workers getting paid and shareholders getting rewarded. Consumers benefit from being able to purchase products. Basically, as I have proven in my own historical arguments which you have not refuted, people get rich when taxes is lower on the rich.\"Aren't you contradicting yourself in this paragraph? You first say naturally the taxes for others would increase/decrease then you said the point is raising taxes SPECIFICALLY on the rich. So, in our scenario, the other tax rates should be considered same except the rich.\"No because you were the one who first started taking about the poor and middle income people, which is not what this debate was about. It was specifically on the rich. I just said that when taxes on the rich are lower that's when the poor and middle class see their taxes cut too. \"I may not know what is enough for the rich, but I certainly know what is enough for the poor. Even 10 percent of rich people's money would be enough for the poor. You still think rich people should be allowed to live extravagant lives, while other people suffer for bread and butter? What use is increasing the capital if there are still poor people on the streets?\"You just ruined your whole case because you just advocated taking 10 pecent of the rich's incomes to give to the poor. In other words, you believe the top income tax rate should be 10 percent. \"Were the police paid more and worked with increased vigilance at those times? A government could simply take the benefits of tax but not give it back, while in our scenario the governments would work. If corruption is everywhere, it wouldn't matter if taxes weren't raised on the rich, the government would still have lot of money.\" What are the benefits of taxes? How did you know if the police worked with vigilance or not? Shouldn't you look that up?\"Most of the rich people can survive very well even being unemployed, and if I am not wrong, your figures are on the raise of taxes on the entire population.\"The rich are part of the population and are thus paying more in taxes. We know that, overall, tax increases are bad because they take money away from the economy. The rich have more money, so they end up getting tax more than anyone else and see a lot of their money taken away.\"So if it is being raised specifically, we can make sure taxes are not raised on the poor, for otherwise this would be about the consequences of raising taxes on all, which is altogether a different issue for me.Also, can you get more global figures rather than only America? I am in India, and I am arguing from my perspective and actions in the country. It would be intriguing to see the unemployment figures of my country, as I am too lazy for researching myself.(DON'T refute this point!!)\"If you look at changes in the tax code, people are naturally going to pay more in tax rate increases. Our question is how those tax rate increases effect the rich since they are usually affected the most by tax changes. Usually the rich might see their tax rate change by a lot, let's say an increase of 10%, but when that happens a new income bracket might be set and then everyone might see small increases. The poor might see a small raise like 1 or 2 percent. Yes, there will be people paying the bottom rate, but some who were on that bottom who see their incomes rise will end up paying more. Finally, this debate was specifically about the top income tax rate and capital gains tax rate of the United States, I'm an American afterall.ConclusionI clearly won this debate.

Correct, costs are increasing. The question is why? Pro doesn't make the case that we have an unregulated market in education, which is what would be required to make the normative argument that we ought to begin intervening. As I will soon argue, there is already a heavy political interest in increasing access to education.2. Analogy to the pre-crash housing market: like higher ed, housing was also the subject of political interest. Unsatisfied with the natural rate of homeownership, programs were instituted to expand access to buyers, many of whom would otherwise be unable to afford it. These measures include tax credits, loan subsidies/purchases [1], and low interest rates. Similarly, in higher ed, there are tax credits for being a full-time student, subsidized loan programs, Pell Grants, etc.The story is the same for both industries--the natural rate of participation isn't \"enough\" according to a political (non-market) calculation. To remedy this, programs are enacted to incentivize participation. The market operates through signaling--market participants send signals carrying information about what's profitable, where capital should flow, which investments are safe/risky, and so on. This is how the price mechanism works for supply and demand--when production exceeds demand, prices drop in response to the surplus. Participants leave the oversaturated market, investment declines, and prices equilibrate as capital goes elsewhere. When politics interferes with signaling, incentive structures are modified, altering what signals are sent/received. This is how bubbles are created. In housing, cheap capital, low rates on mortgages, the state's participation in the secondary mortgage market, tax credits, etc. created an environment in which capital flowed into the housing industry--subprime lending, construction in excess of real demand--rather than being efficiently allocated based on healthy signals. The result? High default rates, near-collapse of the financial services industry, insolvency, record foreclosures, declining property values, and a lot of debt left to people who had no ability to pay, and no business buying an expensive home.What about higher ed? With politics having restructured incentives to move capital to ed, we see many of the same signs ignored during the housing boom--record highs in participation [2], low interest rates, massive subsidy/ loan programs, high debt burdens, and cost increases (climbing home values paralleling cyclical tuition hikes). In short, as with housing, incentive distortions shift capital into ed to the exclusion of other investment opportunities. Even people who denied there was a housing bubble admit the problem exists in industies like healthcare, where big subsidy nets lead to \"unconstrained demand\" [3]. Intervention beget similar conditions in higher ed, where people who otherwise couldn't afford it are able to enter. This is bad for numerous reasons:A) Students and parents end up with massive debt which, being required to make access to education tenable, is often difficult or impossible to repay, as evidenced by default/delinquency rates [4][5]. For those who do pay off loans, the principal + interest-over-time also tends to diminish the advantage of any increase in income they might see. And this assumes that their degree is productive and marketable (i.e., that it involves useful skills and isn't connected to an industry in which there is a labor surplus).B) Since subsidies and loans permit [an increasing quantity of] students/applicants to meet tuition, universities can increase the pace at which they inflate tuition until public funding can't keep pace with cost increases. If my story is true, then public financial assistance for borrowers is actually partly responsible for tuition hikes.C) The relationship between subsidies and pricing--especially the rise in pricing for the non-subsidized--is already well-documented: health care, formal housing, and even in niche markets like rent vouchers for low-income housing [6]. So, not only do subsidy programs endanger the people who use them as the same assistance endangered prime and subprime borrowers in the 2000s; they also raise costs for \"prime students\" who otherwise would not be required to borrow money. Since tuition increases outpace the savings and inflation rates (also given the Fed's current policy of minimizing interest rates), families who would have been able to save enough to put their kids through college are being ushered into subsidy and loan programs which are themselves responsible for runaway tuition increases, creating a weird feedback loop where cheap, subsidized money leads to cost increases, and cost increases outpace savings and inflation to such an extent that affluent families come to rely on subsidies to make up the difference.\"Market Forces\"None of this is actually an argument for intervention--Pro is only contending that costs are going up, and that universities have no incentive to cut costs. But, given a) his lack of an interpretive framework apart from \"research\", and b) my story about bubbles, capital allocation, and the cost-subsidy link, which explains the incentive distortions and guarantees of business, this section is ammunition for my thesis. Plus, many of these private universities which bump up tuition tend to have 90-100% financial aid rates [8], often because they're smart about their scholarship/grant funding and getting contributions. Harvard, for instance, gets a lot of private funding, and has basically eliminated loans from its funding program [9], and still give massive funding to 70% of their students [10].The Value of a Degree1. Using politics to determine the value of a degree is detrimental--investing the time/money makes degrees a signal of higher productivity, and focusing on maximizing the quantity of education devalues the investment for people to whom it would otherwise be valuable, since it just increases the supply of degrees without worrying about whether that education increases productivity, or whether it's a good investment for everyone (which can't be determined politically).2. Access to education is higher/easier than ever, so Pro's nostalgia about \"easier times\" is unwarranted.3. Degree surplus is evidenced by the high rate of unemployment/jobs which are unrelated to or don't require a degree [7]. Some of the degrees also aren't marketable, e.g., art therapy, music, but, even if they were all high-skill degrees (ex: if we selectively subsidized only engineering, computer science, math), we'd just end up with a surplus of engineers, computer scientists, etc., driving down income level and driving up unemployment in those fields. Subsidizing, which floods the market with degrees, and inhibits their capacity to act as signals to employers (disadvantaging those for whom a degree would be a good investment), is just a way of distorting the price mechanism that determines how much of any good/service, including education, needs to be \"produced\" (ex: how many degrees the market can handle before oversaturation occurs and the price of labor drops, which degrees are best to invest in), which means that political administration will be less efficient, a priori, than permitting the market to send signals unhindered about where capital--including human capital--ought to go. Politics screwed up housing by directing excessive amounts of capital into that industry, to disastrous results, and it'll screw up education if signals continue to be ignored. Pro's case just assumes \"education good\", then attempts to maximize how much we get without consideration for how much is socially optimal, or even which degrees are the best to invest in. College is great, but it's not right for everyone, and enticing everyone to sign up will only lead to ruin.Your turn, Pro.", "qid": 50, "docid": "e4a40999-2019-04-18T18:11:30Z-00006-000", "score": 7.547599792480469}, {"content": "Title: The United States government should implement universal health care modeled after the French system. Content: First , I must apologize to my opponent about my timeliness, again. I pledge to keep the rest of this debate on a tighter schedule as far as my input. Thank you for your patience. Although I do not understand why my opponent chose to forgo his first round, by not stating a positive resolution, I plan to demonstrate why the US should adopt the French System of Universal Health Care (FSUHC). FSUHC defined - 1.All legal residents of France are covered by public health insurance, as part of their Social Security System's program. 2.Funded by employer and employee contributions, as well as income tax. Income tax has a heavier burden in paying for it, to compensate for relative decrease in wage income, to limit price gouging on the labor markets, and to more fairly distribute system financing among citizens. 3.Virtually all the doctors participate in the system. The French can choose their doctors, and physicians are free to prescribe any care they deem necessary. 4. 4.There are no deductibles in the national system, just modest co-payments. What's more, the sicker the patient, the lower the fees \u2014 cancer patients are treated free of charge. 5. 5.The system also successfully mixes public and private financing \u2014 most French buy supplemental insurance. 6. 6.Access to health care appears to have produced a healthier nation: France's infant death rate is 3.9 per 1,000 live births, compared with seven per 1,000 in the U.S.. The country has more hospital beds and doctors per capita than the U.S., and a markedly lower rate of mortality from respiratory disease. And France spends less (10.7% of gross domestic product) on health care than the U.S. (16% of GDP). As you can see above, this system is markedly superior to ours. But the most distressing point in why we should use France's example - BusinessWeek studied costs of both systems, and although the French system is in a deficit, and up to 20% of individual income is appropriated to health care, slightly more than half of sick Americans surveyed for their study don't visit a doctor, get a needed test or fill a prescription because of cost. In 2006, the Census Bureau reported that 47 million Americans are without basic health insurance. In the US, health is a business \u2013 In France it is a universal right. According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and others, the U.S. is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have universal health care, and our health care system is rated as the highest in expenditure, first in responsiveness, but 37th in overall performance and 72nd by overall level of health (among 191 member nations included in the study). the French system is much more generous to its entire population than the U.S. is to its seniors. It's time that the USA took the health of it's citizens as seriously as it does terrorism. Thank you. I look forward to my opponents response, and apologize once again for the lateness in my posting.

I will then go over how my opponent's observation is contradictory to the resolved. Then, I shall go over his case and prove that it my opponent does not solve for the resolved, or to my case. Now, onto the debate My opponent's counterplan, once again, is to provide a basic income to all excluding felons, violent criminals, FBI watchlist members and legal immigrants who have lived in the US for less than 10 years. Going over felons and violent criminals first, my opponent has failed to recognize the number of wrongful convictions in our society. \"I feel that if I die this afternoon, I\"ll be able to go to my tomb and rest in peace because my name has finally been cleared,\" said William Vasquez, who was cleared in December of an arson that killed a mother and her five children in 1981. Vasquez already served 31 years in prison, where he went blind for untreated glaucoma, and was released in 2012. He even had an alibi witness at trial, who testified he was with her when the fire was set, but the building owner, Hannah Quick, accused him of the arson. Mr. Vasquez spent half of his life in prison because of a wrongful conviction. If UBI was implemented, does he not get any payment because he was an ex-felon? Although this is only one example, many other people in this world face similar conditions. They deserve to receive a basic income as much as any other people in this world, but under my opponent's counterplan, he would get nothing. Even if my opponent states \"he is no longer a felon\", just imagine those people who are still imprisoned because of wrongful convictions. With a basic income (that my opponent is stating that they should not get), they would not even be able to get out of jail by bail to secure their freedom. Now moving on to legal immigrants, who have lived here less than 10 years - firstly, how does my opponent expect to get a kickstart on their new life if they are unable to receive a substantial income for at least 10 years? A big number of all legal immigrants become homeless because they cannot sustain a substantial income for them and their families. What UBI is doing, as I have stated in my first case, is solving for poverty, INCLUDING those that are immigrants. All people in this world are originally immigrants. Poverty denotes serious lack of the means for proper existence: 100 million people are homeless in america. That is 30% of our population. When you take into account the amount of families that are homeless, and include the number of immigrants in this number, it is unnecessary and is harming our society. As I have stated in my case, poverty is a human-caused tragedy and can be ended with UBI. We are supposed to be helping all Americans, immigrants or not. Now, my opponent agreed to meet my standard of Kantian Social Contract, stating that his case would better solve for it, but has failed to make any arguments or examples or actual facts supporting this statement. Kantian Social Contract is saying that people have the right to do what they want in life to make them feel more human. Any law that denotes an absolute, and takes away these people's rights to be human are immoral. My opponent's counterplan is isolating society but taking away the needed income of so many innocent people, as well as thousands of immigrants each year. My opponent is valuing poverty by taking away the basic income of a grand amount of our society. This is not maximizing the individuality of our individuals. My opponent's grounds/observations states that I \"must prove how UBI would better support the average american compared to a merely a basic income\". Well, I counter this by saying what is an average american? Going by logic, my case thoroughly supports the average american. 33% of all workers say that they are doing the job that they love, while 67% say that they dislike it dramatically. With UBI, people would have that financial freedom to get the job that they want, without being held back and in a job that they dislike because they must be because of the lack of financial security. The 33% can still stay in their job, while the 67% can finally quit, or try to change jobs without fear. This is argument goes along with my first contention, giving the economic freedom to ALL AMERICANS, and, by correlation, the \"average american\". Now, onto my opponent's arguments - firstly, in his first contention, my opponent talks about how in his counterplan, basic income isn't supplied towards violent criminals and felons. Going back to my previous argument, as well as the example of William Vasquez, my opponent does not take into account the number of innocent convictions there are in this world, and is validating taking money away from these innocent people who deserve a basic income. I would also like to take into account that my opponent made the outrageous statement of every single person receiving $10,000 annually (monthly) which is completely absurd. In UBI, what would happen is that individual adults above the age of legality (in most states in America, that would be 18) would get $1,000 a month, and $12,000 a year (to stay above the poverty line) and those under the age of legality (depending on age) would get about $4,000 a year (and that number would gradually increase with age, so it would go to $6,000, $8,000, $10,000 etc.) Moving on from the economic fallacy that my opponent made, he also told us to imagine a world where criminals would get paid $1,000 each year (once again, stating $10,000 annually which is a grand misconception, it would better to be $1,000 annually). Going along with my opponent's math, the criminal group of Tango Blast would receive $190,000,000 in a year based on its members (which would be incorrect math) but overall in a month the group would make a total of $1,900,000. But logically - it wouldn't. Going along with my definition of basic income (see above case), basic income is paid on an individual basis, meaning that Tango Blast would NOT get paid $1,900,000 a month, but rather each member of Tango Blast would receive $1,000 a month. Subtract the cost of housing, any taxes, food, clothes, and healthcare issues that could affect each individual (which cannot be totaled because every human's health and needs are different), then this criminal group makes nowhere near $1,900,000 a month. And this is just by basic logic. And we are missing the big picture here, anyways, and that is the way that these \"crime lords\" actually receive payments. How are they supposed to receive these payments without getting caught or arrested for their crimes? My opponent's case shows no empirical backing, as well as no evidence showing that A) these \"crime lords\" can get their payments without being arrested for their crimes and B) that these groups will get hundreds of thousands of dollars because of Basic Income. My opponent's first contention should fall. Moving on to my opponent's second contention, he states that UBI will become a beacon for more immigrants to come to America to get money. My opponent has three flaws with his logic and one flaw with his counterplan. Firstly, he shows no evidence showing that this would actually take place if UBI was implemented. Secondly, there is already \"mass immigration\" in America. We are literally known as \"The Promised Land\". There have been no negative effects, and my opponent fails to prove how it will be worse. Thirdly, giving these immigrants a basic income would not have a negative effect on our economy (which I'm guessing is my opponent's main concern, because by definition of basic income, it is a cash payment, and not, therefore, in use of food stamp) because these immigrants will still have to pay taxes that will inevitably go back to the actual amount of money used in UBI.

I am not saying that breadth courses aren\u2019t useful for work; I\u2019m saying that almost all courses aren\u2019t useful for work.Con talks about how someone might use sociology or psychology classes to learn \u201chow to interact with people.\u201d While knowing how to interact with people might be a useful skill, it isn\u2019t actually the subject matter of any sociology or psychology class. \u201cUnderstanding human nature\u201d might be part of one of those classes, perhaps an evolutionary psychology class, but it\u2019s hard to see how this applies to any actual job. HTML is certainly an example of a useful skill that someone could use in a job after college. But this just proves my point\u2014writing HTML will prepare you for writing more HTML. That is hardly the same thing as expecting someone to transfer the knowledge they acquired about gender conflicts in sociology class to an actual job.\u201cI read the link he provided in round 1\u201dI find that hard to believe. From the sentence preceding the description of the study involving the retarded woman: \u201cTwo experiences I had illustrate that the answer to that question depends on your point of view.\u201d [1] The author is illustrating an idea, not proving it. Con\u2019s claim that, \u201cFrom there they jumped to the conclusion that skills are not transferable\u201d is simply not true\u2014to conclude that learning is not transferable, the author discussed a century\u2019s worth of other studies on transfer of learning theory (mostly done on college students, not the mentally retarded). [1]C2: SignallingCon again fails to support his claim that college makes students more intelligent. He again repeats that it makes them more knowledgeable, which isn\u2019t the same thing. If general transfer of learning doesn\u2019t exist, then it\u2019s hard to see how college classes that have nothing to do with IQ tests would cause people to get higher IQs. Again, I agreed that going to college is better for building work ethic than sitting at home doing nothing, but given the amount of time students actually spend studying, it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s better at building work ethic than actually having a job. Con also fails to respond to my argument about college signaling conscientiousness.Con argues that students who never went to college for sociology wouldn\u2019t be able to get a job that requires a degree in sociology. Of course, this begs the question, how many jobs require a degree in sociology? All the people I know with liberal arts degrees got jobs that ask for a bachelors degree in anything\u2014suggesting that the job doesn\u2019t particularly care about the specific knowledge they gained in school.C3: Useful EducationEveryone go to college? Why not have everyone get a PhD? Several PhDs? That way we\u2019d maximize productivity.Comments on Voting:Conduct: Con\u2019s complaint here is basically that my argument was unexpected. The resolution was that educational subsidies should be ended\u2014my argument supports the resolution, it just does so in a way Con doesn\u2019t like. I suppose I should have just argued that college is just as wonderful as Con thinks it is, but we shouldn\u2019t subsidize it because I hate poor people\u2014that way I could let Con win and avoid hurting his feelings by making better arguments than him, which apparently is considered poor conduct now. In the future, I will try to always debate exactly the way my opponent wants me to, to avoid having poor conduct.In addition, I think Con should lose the conduct point for lying. He either lied about having read my Detterman source, or did read it, but lied about what it said.Sources: See my intro. This is how the conversation should have gone:LF-\u201cAnd are you a college student? If so your university probably has some sort of search engine for those kind of citations.\u201dF16-\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dLF-\u201cMy bad, I thought you were. Here, you can use google scholar and google books to get a preview of the sources I use. It won\u2019t show the whole book/study, but it can confirm the parts I quote are there. And if you really want to see the whole journal article, I can just email you the pdf from my university\u2019s search engine.\u201dF16-\u201cThanks! And since there\u2019s still 2 days left before I have to post, I still have plenty of time to make my argument\u2014there\u2019s no need for me to just rush ahead and accuse you of lying about your sources without bothering to have this quick conversation first.\u201dBut no.[1] http://cms.educ.ttu.edu...", "qid": 50, "docid": "16199f60-2019-04-18T18:14:23Z-00001-000", "score": 7.529600143432617}, {"content": "Title: Federal Student Loans Should Be Abolished. Content: I will separate my arguments into 5 sections so as to make them more structured. Federal Student Loans Have Caused an Education Bubble Over the past few decades, tuition has skyrocketed inside the United States. Between 1978 and 2012, the tuition in the US has increased 1210%, or 12-fold. (1) This is also 4 times faster than the increase in the consumer price index. This is obviously a huge problem, so the first steps we must take to come up with a solution is to look for the cause or causes. Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, stated that \"The basic problem is simple: Give everyone $100 to pay for higher education and colleges will raise their prices by $100, negating the value of the aid. And inflation-adjusted aid--most of it federal--has certainly gone up, ballooning from $4,602 per undergraduate in 1990-91 to $12,455 in 2010-11. As it did in the housing market, free or reduced priced has artificially inflated the price of college education. Thus begins a classic upward price spiral caused by government intervention: Subsidies raise prices, leading to higher subsidies, which raise prices even more. Yet th
