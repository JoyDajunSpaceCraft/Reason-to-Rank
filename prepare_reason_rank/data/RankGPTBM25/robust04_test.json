ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is issuing technical amendments to existing Appendix B and is adding a new non-mandatory Appendix E to both 29 CFR 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response and 29 CFR 1926.65, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response . The technical amendments to the Appendix B involve the updating of certain reference sources listed in Appendix B to both 29 CFR 1910.120 and 1910.65. The new Appendix E provides suggested guidelines for a more effective training curriculum and program. The mandatory requirements for those training programs are set forth in the main body of 29 CFR 1910.120 and 1926.65. The addition of a non-mandatory Appendix E to these sections will provide supplementary information that can be used by employers for training program development directed toward training those employees engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response activities within the scope of 29 CFR 1910.120 or 1926.65. EFFECTIVE DATE: The effective date for this notice is September 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: There are no written responses required in this notice. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room N&hyph;3647, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20210, 202&hyph;219&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulatory history . On October 17, 1986, former President Reagan signed into law the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499). As part of SARA, the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary) was directed to issue an interim final rule within 60 days after the date of enactment of SARA, which was to provide not less protection for employees engaged in covered hazardous waste operations than the protection contained in two specified documents. Those two documents were the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ``Health and Safety Requirements for Employees Engaged in Field Activities'' manual (EPA ORDER 1440.2), dated 1981, and the existing Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards under Subpart C or 29 CFR part 1926, OSHA's Construction Industry Safety and Health Standards. OSHA published an interim final rule as directed in the Federal Register on December 19, 1986 (51 FR 45654). In section 126 of SARA, the Congress also directed the Secretary to issue, within one year after the date of enactment of SARA, a final standard under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 for the health and safety of employers engaged in hazardous waste operations and emergency response. SARA also indicated that certain specific areas of employee protection, in particular employee training, were relevant to protect employees engaged in hazardous waste operations. OSHA issued a proposed rule on hazardous waste operations and emergency including provisions for training on August 10, 1987 (52 FR 29620). Public hearings on the proposed rule were held during October 1987. As a result of that proposed rule OSHA published a permanent final rule for hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) on March 6, 1989 (54 FR 9294). That permanent final rule became effective on March 6, 1990. In related action, on December 22, 1987, as part of an omnibus budget reconciliation bill (Pub. L. 100&hyph;202), the language of SARA was amended. The amendment addressed section 126(d)(3) of SARA. Section 126(d)(3) of SARA reads as follows before the amendment: (d) Specific Training Standards . -- * * * (3) Certification; Enforcement . -- Such training standards shall contain provisions for certifying that general site workers, on-site managers, and supervisors have received the specified training and shall prohibit any individual who has not received the specified training from engaging in hazardous water operations covered by the standard. The amendment to section 126(d)(3) contained in Pub. L. 100-202 added the following language to the end of paragraph (d)(3): That section 126(d)(3) of SARA is amended by adding a new sentence at the end thereof as follows: The certification procedures shall be no less comprehensive than those adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency in its Model Accreditation Plan for Asbestos Abatement Training as required under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986. In response to the amendment, OSHA on January 26, 1990, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (55 FR 2776) addressing the accreditation of training programs for hazardous waste operations. Since January, 1990, OSHA has been working to develop a final rule addressing the accreditation of certain training programs required in 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65. OSHA will complete shortly action on that final rule. On June 30, 1992, OSHA republished 29 CFR 1910.120 in 29 CFR Part 1926 as 1926.65 at the request of the OSHA Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH). This republication codified most of the requirements affecting construction activities in one part of the CFR for the convenience of construction industry employers and employees. The most recent action on this rule concerns the development of the non-mandatory appendix to be added as Appendix E to 1910.120. This action took place during the September 30, 1993 meeting of ACCSH held in Washington, DC. As part of the Advisory Committee's action, a work group chaired by Mr. John Moran, Director of Safety and Health for the Laborers' Health and Safety Fund made specific recommendations to the full advisory committee concerning OSHA's proposed 29 CFR 1910.121 rulemaking. The first recommendation of the work group was, ``that OSHA promptly issue a non-mandatory appendix to 1910.120, establishing minimum training curriculum guidelines and minimum training provider guidelines (ACCSH Tr. pg. 148, lines 22&hyph;25).'' Mr. Moran made a formal motion that the ACCSH recommend, ``the prompt issuance of a non-mandatory appendix to 1910.120 which contains guidelines for minimum training curriculum, and that minimum training provider requirements to meet the training standards established in 120 (ACCSH Tr. pg. 152, lines 5&hyph;10).'' The motion was passed unanimously (ACCSH Tr. pg. 159, lines 3&hyph;11). The formal report containing the recommendations developed by the work group was presented to the Assistant Secretary by the ACCSH on October 1, 1993. The report included a December, 1991 document titled, `` Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response .'' The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Training Grant Technical Workshop on Training Quality developed the document during a technical workshop on training quality. The workshop, ``Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response was held March 22&hyph;24, 1990 in Washington, DC and was sponsored by NIEHS. Approximately 60 individuals from labor, industry and the government, including representatives from OSHA participated in the workshop. The report recommends that, OSHA should promptly issue a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 which provides guidelines as to minimum training curriculum and training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by the 1910.120 standard. It is our recommendation that this appendix be essentially the NIEHS National Technical Workshop consensus document referred to in the BACKGROUND above and which is appended to this report.&blank; 1 1Memorandum to Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) from John B. Moran, Chair, Accreditation Work Group, ACCSH containing the Accreditation Work Group Report dated October 1, 1993 (pg. 4). The ACCSH recommendation to the Assistant Secretary suggested that the non-mandatory appendix address two topics. First, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines as to the minimum training curriculum for those training activities mandated by 1910.120. Second, ACCSH recommended that the appendix should provide guidelines as to the minimum training provider requirements for those training activities mandated by 1910.120. Non-mandatory Appendix E on Training . Separate from the ACCSH recommendations, several individuals suggested that during the interim period prior to issuing a final rule on training accreditation, OSHA should add a non-mandatory appendix to 29 CFR 1910.120 and 29 CFR 1926.65 that would provide guidance to employers for developing effective training programs. The training provisions of these two standards are stated in performance oriented language in paragraph (e) for hazardous waste site workers, in paragraph (p)(7) for treatment, storage, and disposal facility workers, and in paragraph (q)(6) for emergency response workers. OSHA uses non-mandatory appendices for a number of purposes such as to provide non-regulatory guidance to employees and employers for the purpose of complying with various OSHA regulations or to assist them in developing more effective safety and health operations. They may also be an amplification of interpretive information that is included in the preamble discussions of rulemakings when they are published in the Federal Register. It is often brought to OSHA's attention that the useful interpretive information included in preamble discussions addressing OSHA's standards becomes less accessible when rules and regulations are published later in the Code of Federal Regulations. It has been suggested that having the most important of this type of information available in the same publication as the codified text of a rule would make compliance decision making in the workplace easier. Also non-mandatory appendices provide a non-regulatory mechanism to keep employer and employee populations aware of new technical information that becomes available to the agency subsequent to the issuance of a standard. These new technologies and new types of information may be of assistance to employer and employee populations in complying with the regulatory text to which the appendix is attached. Training provider criteria . OSHA has reviewed the training provider criteria suggested in the `` Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response .'' OSHA is considering fully the issue in the final rule on certification of training programs. Consequently there is no need to insert a non-mandatory appendix on this subject. In the interim, OSHA believes that the standard provides sufficient guidance on the qualifications of instructors and that additional information in an appendix format is unnecessary. Training curriculum guidelines . The document that the ACCSH recommended that OSHA use as the training guidelines to be placed in the non-mandatory appendix is titled, `` Minimum Criteria for Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response .'' It was developed to report the results of a technical workshop on training quality held March 22&hyph;24, 1990 in Washington, DC. The meeting was sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). NIEHS employee training program grantees identified a need to establish criteria for determining the quality of employee health and safety training programs. This was believed by the workshop to be especially critical for meeting the training requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rule for hazardous waste operations and emergency response (29 CFR 1910.120). The NIEHS employee training program grantees planned a workshop to identify, evaluate, discuss and make recommendations on training quality issues in this area. A planning committee met twice to develop a draft discussion document for the workshop's deliberations. The workshop brought together representatives from each of the NIEHS grantees, and invited experts from management, labor, academia, and government. A balance of such representations was sought for each of the workshop's five sub-sessions. The sub-sessions topics included the following: 1. General Criteria. 2. General hazardous waste operations and site-specific training. 3. RCRA-treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) sites. 4. Emergency response. 5. Guidelines for accreditation. At the closing plenary, a draft final report from the workshop was sent out for a review by participants. Comments offered during the closing plenary and for a period after the meeting were received and included as appropriate in the final document. The report represents the views of the technical experts rather than an official position by any agency, including NIEHS. NIEHS is authorized under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) to award grants to nonprofit organizations that demonstrate experience in implementing and operating employee health and safety training and education programs and that demonstrate the ability to reach and involve in training programs target populations ow employees who are or will be engaged in hazardous materials waste removal, containment, or emergency response operations. The grantees who attended the conference met the requirements of and participation in the NIEHS program. OSHA has reviewed the guidelines. Overall they would lead to a highly effective training program. Following them would certainly meet the training requirements of 1910.120 and 1926.65 as a general matter. The detailed guidance they present would be helpful to trainers and employers and would lead to better training of employees. Accordingly OSHA is publishing them as a non-mandatory Appendix E to those standards. However, the legal requirements are set forth in the body of the standards. These require site-specific elements that of course can not be covered in general guidelines. In addition, some of the guidelines go beyond the clear requirements of the regulatory text in paragraphs (a) to (q). In those cases, employers would only be cited if the employee's training did not meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (q). Accordingly, Appendix E is not called ``minimum criteria'' as ACCSH entitled them. In addition, there are other training curriculum resources available that can provide additional guidance to individuals preparing training programs. Therefore, these appendices are not only based upon the NIEHS document but also upon other training program guidance documents. OSHA has utilized documents developed by the National Fire Protection Association, the International Association of Fire Service Instructors, and others to supplement the guidance provided in the NIEHS document. Technical Amendments to Appendix B . It has been brought to the attention of OSHA that certain references made to National Fire Protection Association standards in Appendix B to 1910.120 and 1926.65 are outdated. OSHA makes reference to NFPA 1991, NFPA 1992, and NFPA 1993 as standards that were under development at the time 29 CFR 1910.120 was published. These references are outdated because the NFPA standards referred to in the existing text are no longer ``under development'' but were published in 1990 as voluntary consensus standards by NFPA. The revisions to Appendix B of 1910.120 and Appendix B of 1926.65 that are contained in this notice recognize the adoption of these NFPA standards. The revisions correct editorially the text of these appendices to recognize the current status of the referenced NFPA standards. This document makes technical amendments and adds a non-mandatory appendix for informational purposes that do not change regulatory requirements. Accordingly, the agency finds that notice and comments are unnecessary pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and according to OSHA procedural rules in 29 CFR 1911.5.

Section 1910.120 is also issued under Sec. 126, Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 as amended (29 U.S.C. 655 note), 5 U.S.C. 553, and 29 CFR part 1911. 2. The last two paragraphs of Appendix B to 1910.120_General Description and Discussion of the Levels of Protection and Protective Gear are revised to read as follows: Appendix B to 1910.120_General Description and Discussion of the Levels of Protection and Protective Gear * * * Note: * * * As an aid in selecting suitable chemical protective clothing, it should be noted that the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has developed standards on chemical protective clothing. The standards that have been adopted by include: NFPA 1991_Standard on Vapor-Protective Suits for Hazardous Chemical Emergencies (EPA Level A Protective Clothing). NFPA 1992_Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Hazardous Chemical Emergencies (EPA Level B Protective Clothing). NFPA 1993_Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Non-emergency, Non-flammable Hazardous Chemical Situations (EPA Level B Protective Clothing). These standards apply documentation and performance requirements to the manufacture of chemical protective suits. Chemical protective suits meeting these requirements are labelled as compliant with the appropriate standard. It is recommended that chemical protective suits that meet these standards be used. 3. A new non-mandatory appendix, Appendix E, is added to 29 CFR 1910.120 to read as follows: Appendix E to 1910.120_Training Curriculum Guidelines. The following non-mandatory general criteria may be used for assistance in developing site-specific training curriculum used to meet the training requirements of 29 CFR 1910.120(e); 29 CFR 1910.120(p)(7), (p)(8)(iii); and 29 CFR 1910.120(q)(6), (q)(7), and (q)(8). These are generic guidelines and they are not presented as a complete training curriculum for any specific employer. Site-specific training programs must be developed on the basis of a needs assessment of the hazardous waste site, RCRA/TSDF, or emergency response operation in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.120. It is noted that the legal requirements are set forth in the regulatory text of 1910.120. The guidance set forth here presents a highly effective program that in the areas covered would meet or exceed the regulatory requirements. In addition, other approaches could meet the regulatory requirements. Suggested General Criteria Definitions: ``Competent'' means possessing the skills, knowledge, experience, and judgment to perform assigned tasks or activities satisfactorily as determined by the employer. ``Demonstration'' means the showing by actual use of equipment or procedures. ``Hands-on training'' means training in a simulated work environment that permits each student to have experience performing tasks, making decisions, or using equipment appropriate to the job assignment for which the training is being conducted. ``Initial training'' means training required prior to beginning work. ``Lecture'' means an interactive discourse with a class lead by an instructor. ``Proficient'' means meeting a stated level of achievement. ``Site-specific'' means individual training directed to the operations of a specific job site. ``Training hours'' means the number of hours devoted to lecture, learning activities, small group work sessions, demonstration, evaluations, or hands-on experience. Suggested core criteria: 1. Training facility . The training facility should have available sufficient resources, equipment, and site locations to perform didactic and hands-on training when appropriate. Training facilities should have sufficient organization, support staff, and services to conduct training in each of the courses offered. 2. Training Director . Each training program should be under the direction of a training director who is responsible for the program. The Training Director should have a minimum of two years of employee education experience. 3. Instructors . Instructors should be deem competent on the basis of previous documented experience in their area of instruction, successful completion of a ``train-the-trainer'' program specific to the topics they will teach, and an evaluation of instructional competence by the Training Director. Instructors should be required to maintain professional competency by participating in continuing education or professional development programs or by completing successfully an annual refresher course and having an annual review by the Training Director. The annual review by the Training Director should include observation of an instructor's delivery, a review of those observations with the trainer, and an analysis of any instructor or class evaluations completed by the students during the previous year. 4. Course materials . The Training Director should approve all course materials to be used by the training provider. Course materials should be reviewed and updated at least annually. Materials and equipment should be in good working order and maintained properly. All written and audio-visual materials in training curricula should be peer reviewed by technically competent outside reviewers or by a standing advisory committee. Reviews should possess expertise in the following disciplines were applicable: occupational health, industrial hygiene and safety, chemical/environmental engineering, employee education, or emergency response. One or more of the peer reviewers should be a employee experienced in the work activities to which the training is directed. 5. Students . The program for accepting students should include: a. Assurance that the student is or will be involved in work where chemical exposures are likely and that the student possesses the skills necessary to perform the work. b. A policy on the necessary medical clearance. 6. Ratios . Student-instructor ratios should not exceed 30 students per instructor. Hands-on activity requiring the use of personal protective equipment should have the following student-instructor ratios. For Level C or Level D personal protective equipment the ratio should be 10 students per instructor. For Level A or Level B personal protective equipment the ratio should be 5 students per instructor. 7. Proficiency assessment . Proficiency should be evaluated and documented by the use of a written assessment and a skill demonstration selected and developed by the Training Director and training staff. The assessment and demonstration should evaluate the knowledge and individual skills developed in the course of training. The level of minimum achievement necessary for proficiency shall be specified in writing by the Training Director. If a written test is used, there should be a minimum of 50 questions. If a written test is used in combination with a skills demonstration, a minimum of 25 questions should be used. If a skills demonstration is used, the tasks chosen and the means to rate successful completion should be fully documented by the Training Director. The content of the written test or of the skill demonstration shall be relevant to the objectives of the course. The written test and skill demonstration should be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the curriculum and any update should be approved by the Training Director. The proficiency assessment methods, regardless of the approach or combination of approaches used, should be justified, documented and approved by the Training Director. The proficiency of those taking the additional courses for supervisors should be evaluated and documented by using proficiency assessment methods acceptable to the Training Director. These proficiency assessment methods must reflect the additional responsibilities borne by supervisory personnel in hazardous waste operations or emergency response. 8. Course certificate . Written documentation should be provided to each student who satisfactorily completes the training course. The documentation should include: a. Student's name. b. Course title. c. Course date. d. Statement that the student has successfully completed the course. e. Name and address of the training provider. f. An individual identification number for the certificate. g. List of the levels of personal protective equipment used by the student to complete the course. This documentation may include a certificate and an appropriate wallet-sized laminated card with a photograph of the student and the above information. When such course certificate cards are used, the individual identification number for the training certificate should be shown on the card. 9. Recordkeeping . Training providers should maintain records listing the dates courses were presented, the names of the individual course attenders, the names of those students successfully completing each course, and the number of training certificates issued to each successful student. These records should be maintained for a minimum of five years after the date an individual participated in a training program offered by the training provider. These records should be available and provided upon the student's request or as mandated by law. 10. Program quality control . The Training Director should conduct or direct an annual written audit of the training program. Program modifications to address deficiencies, if any, should be documented, approved, and implemented by the training provider. The audit and the program modification documents should be maintained at the training facility. Suggested Program Quality Control Criteria Factors listed here are suggested criteria for determining the quality and appropriateness of employee health and safety training for hazardous waste operations and emergency response.

Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1910.120(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations. States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1910.120. Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers, employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances in the community. a. General considerations . Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1910.120(q)(6). Emergency response organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected. (1) Hazard recognition, including: (A) Nature of hazardous substances present, (B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics. (2) Principles of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk assessment. (3) Safe work practices and general site safety. (4) Engineering controls and hazardous waste operations. (5) Site safety plans and standard operating procedures. (6) Decontamination procedures and practices. (7) Emergency procedures, first aid, and self-rescue. (8) Safe use of field equipment. (9) Storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances. (10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment. (11) Safe sampling techniques. (12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other related laws concerning right-to-know, safety and health, compensations and liability. (13) Medical monitoring requirements.

(i) Safe use engineering controls and equipment on site. (j) Names of personnel and alternates responsible for safety and health. C. Emergency response training. Federal OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.65(q) are directed toward private sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix are directed toward that employee population. However, they also impact indirectly through State OSHA or USEPA regulations some public sector emergency responders. Therefore, the guidelines provided in this portion of the appendix may be applied to both employee populations. States with OSHA state plans must cover their employees with regulations at least as effective as the Federal OSHA standards. Public employees in states without approved state OSHA programs covering hazardous waste operations and emergency response are covered by the U.S. EPA under 40 CFR 311, a regulation virtually identical to 1926.65. Since this is a non-mandatory appendix and therefore not an enforceable standard, OSHA recommends that those employers, employees or volunteers in public sector emergency response organizations outside Federal OSHA jurisdiction consider the following criteria in developing their own training programs. A unified approach to training at the community level between emergency response organizations covered by Federal OSHA and those not covered directly by Federal OSHA can help ensure an effective community response to the release or potential release of hazardous substances in the community. a. General considerations . Emergency response organizations are required to consider the topics listed in 1926.65(q)(6). Emergency response organizations may use some or all of the following topics to supplement those mandatory topics when developing their response training programs. Many of the topics would require an interaction between the response provider and the individuals responsible for the site where the response would be expected. (1) Hazard recognition, including: (A) Nature of hazardous substances present, (B) Practical applications of hazard recognition, including presentations on biology, chemistry, and physics. (2) Principles of toxicology, biological monitoring, and risk assessment. (3) Safe work practices and general site safety. (4) Engineering controls and hazardous waste operations. (5) Site safety plans and standard operating procedures. (6) Decontamination procedures and practices. (7) Emergency procedures, first aid, and self-rescue. (8) Safe use of field equipment. (9) Storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous substances. (10) Use, care, and limitations of personal protective equipment. (11) Safe sampling techniques. (12) Rights and responsibilities of employees under OSHA and other related laws concerning right-to-know, safety and health, compensations and liability. (13) Medical monitoring requirements.

(5) Incident commander . The incident commander is the individual who, at any one time, is responsible for and in control of the response effort. This individual is the person responsible for the direction and coordination of the response effort. An incident commander's position should be occupied by the most senior, appropriately trained individual present at the response site. Yet, as necessary and appropriate by the level of response provided, the position may be occupied by many individuals during a particular response as the need for greater authority, responsibility, or training increases. It is possible for the first responder at the awareness level to assume the duties of incident commander until a more senior and appropriately trained individual arrives at the response site. Therefore, any emergency responder expected to perform as an incident commander should be trained to fulfill the obligations of the position at the level of response they will be providing including the following: (A) Ability to analyze a hazardous substance incident to determine the magnitude of the response problem. (B) Ability to plan and implement an appropriate response plan within the capabilities of available personnel and equipment. (C) Ability to implement a response to favorably change the outcome of the incident in a manner consistent with the local emergency response plan and the organization's standard operating procedures. (D) Ability to evaluate the progress of the emergency response to ensure that the response objectives are being met safely, effectively, and efficiently. (E) Ability to adjust the response plan to the conditions of the response and to notify higher levels of response when required by the changes to the response plan.

Benzidine was found to be present in several wastestreams from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, including wastewaters from both facilities that manufacture these pigments. The Agency believes that benzidine is either a raw material contaminant or a reaction by-product from the process. Large quantities of aniline, typically in excess, are used as a raw material to this process. As a result, this wastestream was found to contain over three percent aniline. The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for aniline is 8E&hyph;5 for the landfill scenario. In addition to benzidine and aniline, the waste was found to contain two other hazardous constituents that are believed to be by-products of the reaction and pose a significant risk at the concentrations detected for the municipal landfill management scenario. Two additional compounds presented in Table II&hyph;9, 1,2- diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, coelute on the mass spectrum (see Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, for a discussion on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for coeluting compounds). Both compounds are likely oxidation products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that either contaminant may be present at all or part of the concentration detected. The Agency conducted the risk assessment using the health-based levels for 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, independently. For disposal in a municipal landfill, the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for these coeluting compounds, based on the toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, is 2E&hyph;5. In addition to assessing the risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of this wastewater treatment sludge, all of the constituents discussed above ( i.e. , aniline, benzidine, and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine/azobenzene) are believed to co-exist in the wastestream. The processes that produce triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are operated continuously all year. As a result, the constituents detected in the wastestream are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined calculated risk of these individual constituents, for the municipal landfill scenario would be 2E&hyph;4 at the high end. However, the risks associated with the current and plausible management practice for this wastestream (blending with non-hazardous fuel for combustion) are insignificant. As discussed in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency believes that the fuel blending will continue. The relatively high organic content of the waste gives the material value as a fuel ingredient and, therefore, generators of this waste have an economic incentive to continue fuel blending. Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list the wastestream as hazardous. If the NPDES program requirements were to change ( i.e. , become more stringent) then those triarylmethane pigment producers that currently do not generate a sludge could be forced to generate a sludge due to their efforts to meet new NPDES requirements. In that case, the plausible management scenario would change, and other practices, such as landfilling, would become possible. The Agency may reopen this listing decision should this occur, and will use the risk levels associated with this management scenario to make a revised listing determination. b. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. Summary The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. As shown in Table II&hyph;10, these wastewaters contain an average aniline concentration of 200 ppm. In addition, the wastewaters contain the same hazardous by-products found in the wastewater treatment sludge. Although this wastestream, if managed in surface impoundments, would meet the criteria set out in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or the environment if released into the environment, the Agency has determined that management in surface impoundments is not plausible for this wastestream. The Agency believes this because 100% of this wastestream is managed in exempt tanks. The Agency has no reason to believe that this management practice will change. Risk associated with treatment in tanks is insignificant and, thus, the Agency is proposing not to list this waste as hazardous. However, for comparison purposes, the Agency has calculated the risks associated with disposal of this wastestream in a surface impoundment. If, based on comments, the Agency determines that it is not reasonable to assume that management in tanks is the correct plausible management scenario, the Agency probably would determine that management in a surface impoundment is the appropriate plausible management scenario. Discussion These wastewaters are generated from filtrations of process intermediates and products, flushing operations, equipment washdowns, floor washings, and process operations. Based on response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, a total of 757,080 metric tons, or 0.4 million gallons per day, of wastewater from the production of triarylmethane (TAM) pigments is generated. Information on generation relevant to this discussion is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. All of the wastewaters generated from TAM pigment production (using aniline as a feedstock) are treated in tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. The data presented in Table II&hyph;10 represent three samples collected from two TAM pigment-manufacturing facilities.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00060", "score": 7.963399887084961}, {"content": "Title: Content: Option A requires air emission controls on all TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers managing hazardous waste with any detectable volatile organic concentration as determined at the point where the waste is generated (i.e., a volatile organic concentration action level of 0 ppmw). Under Option A, tanks use a cover vented to a control device except for tanks handling certain hazardous wastes. Tanks in which the organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank is less than 10.4 kPa (approximately 1.5 psi) may use a cover without additional controls. All surface impoundments use a cover vented to a control device. Containers use cover and submerged fill for loading hazardous wastes into the containers. Option B requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. The control requirements are the same as described for Option A with one exception; surface impoundments used for storage of hazardous waste and surface impoundments used for treatment of hazardous waste by a process not requiring aeration or agitation of the waste require covers only. Option C requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 500 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Option B. Option C is the same control option selected as the basis for the proposed rule. Option D requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 1,500 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B and C. Option E requires air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes having a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated greater than 3,000 ppmw. The air emission control requirements are the same as described for Options B, C, and D. B. Control Option Impacts The EPA estimated nationwide organic emission and cancer risk reductions that would be achieved if air standards were implemented for each of the five control options. The ``baseline'' nationwide organic emissions from TSDF are estimated to be approximately 1 million Mg/yr. The estimated nationwide TSDF organic emissions assuming implementation of the individual control options are 30,000 Mg/yr for Option A, 41,000 Mg/yr for Option B, 48,000 Mg/yr for Option C, 51,000 Mg/yr for Option D, and 90,000 Mg/yr for Option E. To assess the risk of contracting cancer posed by exposure to organic emissions from TSDF, the EPA used two measures of health risk: Annual cancer incidence and maximum individual risk (MIR). The annual cancer incidence parameter represents an estimate of population risk and, as such, measures the aggregate risk to all people in the United States estimated to be living within the vicinity of TSDF. The MIR parameter represents the potential of air emissions from a particular source to cause cancer in the most exposed hypothetical individual under the assumptions used in the risk and exposure assessments. Estimation of these health risk parameters requires the EPA to make several critical assumptions regarding the TSDF plant configurations and operating practices, the composition of wastes managed at these TSDF, the cancer potency of the organics contained in these wastes, the emission of these organics to the atmosphere from TSDF sources, and the exposure of people living near TSDF to these air toxic emissions. The complex interrelationship of the various assumptions prevents the EPA from definitively characterizing the estimated health risk parameter values as being overestimates or underestimates.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941206-0-00148", "score": 7.962800025939941}, {"content": "Title: Content: Eligible Applicants Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.

It is expected that the awards will range from $75,000 to $125,000. Awards are funded for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 2 years. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. Purpose The purpose of the program is to assist public health agencies in conducting site-specific health activities recommended by HARP to assess the public health impact of human exposure to hazardous substances in communities located near hazardous waste sites or releases. A current list of sites in the applicant's State rated as Urgent Public Health Hazard, Public Health Hazard, and Indeterminate Public Health Hazard may be obtained from Wendell Webb, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Public Health Practice Coordination Group, telephone (404) 639&hyph;0566. Program Requirements Applicants must specify the type of award for which they are applying, either grant or cooperative agreement. These two types of Federal assistance are explained below. A. Grants In a grant, the applicant will be required to conduct the proposed study without substantial programmatic involvement from the funding agency. Therefore, the grantee's application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to conduct the study. Applications should include a protocol which will undergo scientific peer review as required by ATSDR. The applicant's protocol should contain consent forms and questionnaires, baseline morbidity and mortality information, procedures for collecting biologic and environmental specimens and for conducting laboratory analysis of the test specimens, statistical and epidemiologic analysis of the study information, and a description of the safeguards for protecting the confidentiality of individuals on whom data are collected. The applicant must include in the application a methodology for ongoing community interaction/involvement. By comparison, the activities of the recipient and the ATSDR relating to a cooperative agreement are different and are described in paragraph B. B. Cooperative Agreements In a cooperative agreement, the funding agency will assist the collaborator in conducting the study. The application should be presented in a manner that demonstrates the applicant's ability to address the health study in a collaborative manner with the funding agency. The cooperative activities of the recipient agency and the funding agency are: 1. Recipient Activities a. The recipient will develop a protocol and conduct the recommended study. This protocol will undergo scientific peer review as required by ATSDR. b. The recipient is required to provide proof by citing a State code or regulation or other State pronouncement under authority of law, that medical information obtained pursuant to the agreement will be protected from disclosure when the consent of the individual to release identifying information is not obtained. c. The recipient will develop a mechanism for ongoing interaction with the affected community. 2. ATSDR Activities a. ATSDR will provide assistance in both the planning and implementation phases of the field work called for under the study protocol. b. ATSDR will provide consultation and assist in monitoring the data and specimen collection. c. ATSDR will participate in the study analysis. d. ATSDR will collaborate in interpreting the study findings. e. ATSDR will conduct technical and peer review.

The list of violations uncovered during Health Department inspections begun a year ago included leaking drums of hazardous waste, inadequate monitoring of ground water contaminants and unauthorized storage of waste. The department also complained about shoddy records that make it unclear \"whether they know where their wastes are so they can manage them properly.\" Meanwhile, nearly 100 agents from the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency spent a second day seizing documents and taking samples of the air, water and soil at the controversial plant northwest of Denver. Governor Not Informed But the Justice Department still refused to tell even Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and the state's Department of Health exactly what prompted the unprecedented probe or what the agents hope to find. Without those specific allegations, the Health Department said it cannot declare with full confidence that there is no threat to public health and safety. Tom Looby, assistant health director, said the Justice Department \"is reviewing\" a request for details. He said the Health Department's preliminary order Wednesday that Rocky Flats comply with state regulations was independent from the federal investigation and that the timing was mere coincidence. The Health Department violations \"raise some serious concerns about the ability of the Department of Energy and Rockwell International Corp. to manage\" the facility, Looby said. The plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear bombs, is owned by the U.S. Department of Energy and is operated by Rockwell. \"No individual instance we discovered is a terribly nasty violation,\" said David Shelton, director of the Health Department's hazardous materials and waste management division. \"But in aggregate, the violations show the facility has a great deal of difficulty in managing hazardous waste. . . . \" At Rockwell headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., a statement released Wednesday said the company \"is confident the Rocky Flats plant . . . has been and is being run safely and in compliance with applicable laws.\" A videotape message from Henson Moore, assistant secretary of energy, was played over closed-circuit televisions to the Colorado facility's 6,000 employees Wednesday. \"He gave us a rah-rah speech to do our jobs professionally, that our future at the plant depends on the kind of job we do in the next 10 days,\" said a chemical operator at the plant who asked not to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his job. Authorities said the search of the plant by federal agents would take about 10 days, but the entire investigation could last six months to a year. The worker, a 10-year employee at Rocky Flats, dismissed the federal investigation as \"all for show . . . to finally say to the state: 'We'll do something about it, we don't know what, and we'll make it real dramatic so the whole state will say Rocky Flats will finally get what they deserve.' \" The worker said employees do not routinely report infractions of plant regulations \"unless it's a major nuclear thing\" because \"you don't rat on your buddy.\" He insisted Rocky Flats is safe, dismissing the investigation as \"unfounded scare tactics . . . to close the plant.\" The Department of Energy said last year that Rocky Flats would be closed within the next 20 years as part of a plan to consolidate the country's seven nuclear weapons facilities. But both federal authorities and plant spokesmen say Rocky Flats is expected to operate as usual while the current federal search warrant is being executed, with temporary closures of some sections as needed for safety reasons. The Justice Department has discussed the investigation only in broad terms, saying it focuses on the storage and disposal of hazardous and mixed hazardous and radioactive waste, unpermitted treatment of waste, falsification of documents and concealing environmental contamination. Three Federal Laws The violations would fall under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which governs hazardous waste disposal, and federal water pollution control and false statement laws. The maximum penalties under hazardous waste and clean water laws are 15 years imprisonment and $250,000 in personal fines plus $1 million in corporate fines for knowingly endangering public welfare. Violating regulations or statutory requirements brings a maximum of two years imprisonment and $50,000 in fines under the waste disposal act and three years in prison and fines of $50,000 per day under the water pollution control law. Officials said the federal search warrant at Rocky Flats did not name any individuals. The Health Department complaint gives Rocky Flats 10 days to respond to the alleged violations. Officials said some of the infractions -- such as the leaky storage drums -- were taken care of immediately when health inspectors spotted them. The Health Department complaint is a civil, not criminal, action, which could eventually result in fines against Rocky Flats if it fails to comply. Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) said legislators were told in a briefing Tuesday that the investigation was spawned 10 months ago by \"whistle blowers.\" However, Colorado's FBI agent-in-charge, Bob Pence, said the joint probe by the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency was begun in May, 1987.

Often, the cost of different management scenarios can be a determinative factor in dictating the plausibility of waste management scenarios. In the absence of other potential cost factors, such as liability, the plausibility that a facility would choose a waste management scenario increases as the expense of that management practice decreases. Conversely, it is more implausible to assume that a firm would chose management activities that impose a higher cost (where cost includes the likelihood of future potential liabilities.) Cost can be a consideration the Agency uses in choosing which management scenario to project as a scenario to analyze for determining potential risk of waste management. These factors are presented as examples; there may be others appropriate to specific industries. In characterizing the risks for a wastestream where more than one disposal scenario is plausible, the Agency will use the results of the risk assessment for the plausible scenario that presents the highest risks. Note that EPA considers the extent to which the plausible management scenario calculated to cause the highest risk is practiced, or could be practiced. Management practices the Agency believes probably would occur infrequently may be less determinative in the final listing determination process. As the probability that generators would use a management practice increases, the greater the weight that set of risk values has in the final listing determination. 2. Risk Levels in Making Listing Decisions As noted earlier, the Agency's listing determination policy utilizes a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach in which risk is a key factor. Risk measurements used include carcinogen risk, non-carcinogen risk as determined by hazard quotient (HQ), and ecological risk. However, risk levels themselves do not necessarily represent the sole basis for a listing. There can be uncertainty in calculated risk values and so other factors are considered in conjuction with risk in making a listing decision. a. Use of Risk Levels in a Listing Decision. EPA's current listing determination procedure (illustrated in Figure 1) uses as an initial cancer-risk ``level of concern'' a calculated risk level of 1 \u00d7 10 ^5 (one in one hundred thousand) and/or HQs (and/or environmental risk quotients [EQs]) of 1 at any one point in time. Note that individual risks can occur at different points in time. For example, a category of wastestream that is both burned in a boiler by one facility but placed in a landfill by another would be projected to cause exposure through both the air and the drinking water pathways. It is likely that risks from each source will occur at different times, since air exposures would probably occur sooner than groundwater exposures. The Agency will take the timing factor into account when analyzing risk. In accordance with EPA policy, risks from individual carcinogens generally are added together. Listing decisions from this risk level of concern generally will be as follows. BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P E:GRAPHICSEP22DE94.000 BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;C (1) Wastestreams for which the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level is 1 \u00d7 10 ^5 or higher generally are considered initial candidates for a list decision. (2) Wastestreams for which these risks are calculated to be 1 \u00d7 10 ^4 or higher, or 1 or higher HQs or EQs for any individual non-carcinogen, or non-carcinogens that elicit adverse effects on the same target organ, generally will be considered to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment and generally will be listed as hazardous waste. Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively assumed to pose sufficient risk to require their listing as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams there can in some cases be factors which could mitigate the high hazard presumption. These additional factors, explained below, also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination. (3) Wastestreams for which the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level is lower than 1 \u00d7 10 ^5 generally are considered initial candidates for a no-list decision. (4) Wastestreams for which these risks are calculated to be 1 \u00d7 10 ^6 or lower, and lower than 1.0 HQs or EQs for any non-carcinogens, generally will be considered not to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment and generally will not be listed as hazardous waste. Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively assumed not to pose sufficient risk as to require their listing as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams, in some cases, there can be factors that could mitigate the low hazard presumption. These also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00025", "score": 7.807600021362305}, {"content": "Title: Content: 3. What type of data would help to either support or refute the predictions made by QSAR? 2. Plausible Mismanagement Scenario The Agency developed baseline risk estimates by selecting plausible mismanagement practices based on information collected in the RCRA Section 3007 survey for current management operations. For wastewaters, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement practice to be the current practice of deep well injection. The Agency has no information or reason to believe that, if not listed, the wastewaters are likely to be managed in a different manner, except if pretreatment of wastewaters is required prior to injection. For sludges and waste solids, the Agency selected the plausible mismanagement to be an unlined landfill. Currently, a portion of the waste goes to a lined Subtitle D landfill. In addition, the Agency has information that a portion of these wastes, while not regulated as hazardous, are managed as hazardous with disposal in Subtitle C landfills. However, the Agency lacks adequate information showing that, if not listed as hazardous, the wastes would continue to be disposed in lined landfills and result in significantly lower estimates of potential risk. The Agency requests comment on this approach to modelling plausible mismanagement practices. 3. Risk Analysis Risk characterization approach. The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments will be expected to address or provide descriptions of: (1) Individual risk to include the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, (2) important subgroups of the population such as highly exposed or highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known, and (3) population risk. In addition to the presentation of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures with an open discussion of uncertainties. Individual risk. Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population, the risk levels of various groups within the population, and the average risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route; (2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating risk for an exposure pathway that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor. Population risk. Descriptors of population risk are intended to convey information about the risk borne by the population or population segment being studied. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the number of cases of a particular health effect that probabilistically could occur within the population during a given time period, the number of persons or percent of the population above a certain risk level or health benchmark (e.g., RfD or RfC), and risk for a particular population segment. Risk assessment. The analysis of risks was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modelling of waste mismanagement scenarios. Specifically, for disposal of solids in unlined landfills, the concentration of the constituents of concern in the landfill leachate first was determined using the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) on selected record samples, or when TCLP data were lacking, by assuming a leachate concentration based on the aqueous solubility of the constituent. It then was assumed that the leachate would be diluted by a factor of 100 (as described in the Toxicity Characteristic Rule 55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990) before reaching the nearest drinking water well. The resulting diluted concentrations can be then compared with the health-based values. In the case of this analysis, a one-in-a-million (10 ^6 ) risk level or hazard quotient of 1 was used. For wastewaters, the situation was more complicated. One facility has been granted a no-migration variance from the land disposal restrictions. The second facility, which consists of several separate plants, has not obtained such a variance. The plants at the second facility currently dispose of process wastewaters by deep well injection. Modelling for specific wastewater streams was based on the possibilities of leakage of injected wastewaters from the injection zone upward to a drinking water aquifer through the abandoned oil and gas wells in the area. Details of this modelling are given in the Risk Modelling Background Document and summarized in the individual wastewater risk assessment to be discussed in the following sections.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940511-1-00084", "score": 7.7895002365112305}, {"content": "Title: Content: By applying the lower and upper ranges of exposure, OSHA estimates that the number of nonsmoking employees exposed to ETS to be 13.9 to 36.1 million employees. C. Nonregulatory Alternatives (1) Introduction The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating occupational safety and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' It is on the basis of this congressional directive that OSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to indoor air pollutants. The discussion below assesses the requisite preconditions for optimal safety in the context of a free market economy, and real world economic factors are compared with the free market paradigm to illustrate the shortcoming of the nonregulatory environment. (2) Market Imperfections Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor markets where employees, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and ultimately by the consumers who pay for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized, private employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the total cost to the firm, the work force, and society of the expected injury or illness. The conditions of perfect competition do not need to be completely satisfied in order for the forces of the market to approximate an efficient outcome. However, some market imperfections can produce sub-optimal results that can be improved upon with regulatory action. In the case of this rulemaking, employees face a significant health risk which is not adequately addressed by current nonregulatory alternatives. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions to provide greater health protection for workers exposed to toxic substances. Although OSHA believes that adequate job safety and health could exist in the private market under perfect conditions, the private market often fails to provide acceptable levels of safety and health in instances where these conditions are not met. It appears that at least two of several conditions traditionally considered essential components of perfect markets are absent from the environment in which employees are exposed to hazards associated with exposure to indoor pollutants: (1) Perfect employee knowledge of risks and (2) perfect employee mobility between jobs. First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that in the absence of immediate or clear-cut danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term effects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatory payments may, in fact, have a disincentive to provide information to employees. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development of chronic disabling disease. Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related or could have other causes_employees and employers may not link disease with such occupational exposure. Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances, many face limited employment options. Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemployment rates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily. In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better paying but more hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay and risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demands of more mobile workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware of job risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not be fully compensated. Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflect accurately the value that workers place on health. In addition to these market imperfections, externalities occur if employers and employees settle for an inefficiently low level of protection from hazardous substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced diseases, including the costs of premature death, chronic illness, and disability. Those individuals who suffer from occupationally related illnesses are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. If private employers do not have to pay the full cost of production, they have no economic incentive to reduce hazards whenever the cost of hazard abatement is greater than the cost of the expected illness. In this way, the private market fails to produce optimal levels of safety.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940405-1-00096", "score": 7.704100131988525}, {"content": "Title: Content: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [Announcement 431] Surveillance of Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Introduction The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a cooperative agreement program to conduct surveillance of hazardous substances emergency events.

Telephone: (202) 219&hyph;8615. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA from time to time investigates workplace incidents which involve not only injuries to workers directly exposed to hazards, but injuries and potential injuries to employees who voluntarily attempt to rescue or assist their fellow workers. OSHA is aware of many instances in which employees have voluntarily rescued coworkers or rendered emergency assistance in the aftermath of workplace accidents, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves. Until recently, there has been no written instruction by OSHA to its field offices providing guidance in such situations. Accordingly, the agency has decided to issue an interpretive rule clarifying its citation policy regarding employers whose employees perform or attempt to perform rescues of individuals in life-threatening danger. It is not OSHA's policy to interfere with or to regulate every decision by a worker to place himself at risk to save another individual. Nor is it OSHA's policy to issue citations to employers whose employees voluntarily undertake acts of heroism to save another individual from imminent harm, where rescue operations are not part of the employee's job responsibilities and the likelihood that a rescue may become necessary is not reasonably foreseeable. At the same time, employers who have employees working in environments where the possibility of life-threatening accidents is reasonably foreseeable are required by various OSHA standards and the general duty clause to take appropriate precautions to assure that the rescuers themselves do not become victims. See, e.g., Pride Oil Well Service, 15 BNA&hyph;OSHC 1808 (Rev. Comm.1992); ARO. Inc., 1 BNA&hyph;OSHC 1453 (Rev. Com. 1973). Accidents requiring rescue efforts are reasonably foreseeable in certain working environments such as, for example, trenches and excavations, hazardous waste operations and emergency response work, or construction work over water. Confined spaces are another occupational setting where rescuers, without proper equipment and precautions, often are killed or injured. ``Worker Deaths in Confined Spaces: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports'', National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, No. 94&hyph;103 (1994). Because the occurrence of accidents which invite rescue attempts is foreseeable in various industrial processes and environments, a variety of OSHA standards include precautions and safeguards for rescue-related operations, including, e.g., the emergency planning and response provisions of the process safety management standard, 29 CFR 1910.119(n), and hazardous waste operations standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(1), (p) and (q); and the standards on confined spaces in general industry, 29 CFR 1910.146, and in grain handling, 1910.272(d), (e), and (g). In construction, specific rescue precautions are prescribed, e.g., for work performed near or over water, and for excavation work, 29 CFR 1926.106, 1926.651(g).

SUMMARY: EPA is proposing regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals engaged in such activities are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged in such activities are certified. This proposed rule would also establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities and require that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified individuals. When promulgated, the rule would fulfil the mandate of section 402 (a)(1) of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally, as part of this proposed rule, EPA has, in accordance with section 404(d) of TSCA, developed a proposed Model State Program. When promulgated, this program may be adopted by any State that seeks to administer and enforce a State program under Title IV of TSCA. DATES: Written comments in response to this proposed rule must be received on or before November 1, 1994. At a later date, the Agency will announce the time and place of an informal hearing where oral comments will be heard.

Authority EPA is issuing this proposed rule under the authority of section 402 and 404 of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (15 U.S.C. 2682 and 2684.). Section 402(a) of TSCA directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities. Section 404(a) of TSCA requires that any State that seeks to administer and enforce the requirements established by the Agency under section 402 or 406 of TSCA must submit to the Administrator of EPA, in such form as the Administrator shall require, a request for authorization of such a program. Section 406 of TSCA requires EPA to publish and from time-to-time revise, a lead hazard information pamphlet and to publish regulations requiring the distribution of such pamphlet. The requirements of section 406 are being developed in a separate rulemaking. II. Objective The objective of this regulation is to address the nation's need for a qualified and properly trained workforce to assist in the elimination of hazards associated with lead-based paint. Providing for this workforce will ensure that individuals and firms will conduct lead-based paint activities in a way that will safeguard the environment and protect human health, specifically, the health of building occupants (especially children under 6 years of age) and the workers themselves. To successfully confront the issues associated with lead-based paint hazards at the national level will require the involvement of many partners working together. In promulgating this regulation, EPA will be establishing the framework required to address lead-based paint hazards. This framework will ultimately provide support for and enhance activities currently conducted by public health officials. In addition to a support system for public health officials, a suitable infrastructure is needed for other mandates of TSCA Title IV. These mandates include the promulgation of regulations for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in real estate transactions, and the development of a pamphlet to educate the public on potential hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities. Activities such as these increase public awareness of the hazards of lead-based paint, resulting in the need for a workable regulatory infrastructure to respond to the public's concerns. The Agency recognizes the nation's public health communities as powerful contributors in support of the program outlined in this proposed regulation. Through the collective efforts of public health communities to address childhood lead poisoning in areas such as blood-lead screening and case management, and EPA, through the identification and control of lead-based paint hazards, the goal of preventing the poisoning of children from lead-based paint will be realized nationwide. III. Background On October 28, 1992, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (``Title X'') became law. The purposes of Title X include: 1. To develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible. 2. To reorient the national approach to the presence of lead-based paint in housing to implement, on a priority basis, a broad program to evaluate and reduce lead-based paint hazards in the Nation's housing stock. 3. To encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 amended TSCA by adding a new Title IV. Several sections of Title X direct EPA to promulgate regulations aimed at fulfilling the purposes of the Title X. These include TSCA section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, which directs EPA to promulgate a final regulation to govern the training and certification of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, the accreditation of training programs and standards for conducting lead-based paint activities; and section 404, Authorized State Programs, which provides that any State may seek to administer and enforce the requirements established by the Agency under sections 402 and 406. This proposed rule addresses both sections 402(a) and 404(d). Rules to address the requirements of other sections of TSCA Title IV (e.g. sections 403 and 406), are being proposed separately. Independently, these other sections of TSCA Title IV will support the overriding objectives of Title X. For example, a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based paint hazards in the home has been proposed under section 406. Section 403 health-based standards will be developed and promulgated to provide the basis for identifying hazardous levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint. Studies to determine whether renovation and remodelling activities may pose a lead-based paint hazard, as well as studies to determine the efficiencies of various abatement technologies are also being conducted under section 402(c)(2). Given the interrelated nature of the various sections of TSCA Title IV, EPA has developed and proposed a subpart A to 40 CFR part 745 which would serve as a reference point for the terms and provisions common to each of the regulations to be promulgated under Title IV. Later in this preamble these other sections of Title IV and their relevance to today's proposal will be discussed in more detail. Before it began the development of this proposed rule, EPA informally met with a broad range of interested parties to solicit information on the subject of lead-based paint activities training, accreditation, certification, and standards. In addition, the Agency received written comments from dozens of individuals, firms, organizations and States, all of whom have provided their own perspective on Title X. Additionally, while the Agency continued to meet informally with interested groups and review written comments, the Society for Occupational and Environmental Health (SOEH) held a series of workshops with experts in the worker protection and training arena as participants. Following the workshops, SOEH drafted and submitted to the Agency its recommendations for effective worker protection during lead-based paint activities. The Agency has included the SOEH document and all other written comments, and written summaries of meetings in the public docket. The Agency is grateful to all who took the time to provide information, ideas, and suggestions. Over the last several months, the Agency has carefully reviewed and considered all of this input. While not all points of view were incorporated in the proposed rule, this proposal reflects many of the thoughts and viewpoints of these interested parties. IV. Scope A. Lead-Based Paint Activities This proposed regulation deals with the broad category of lead-based paint activities. The term lead-based paint activities is defined by section 402(b) of TSCA to mean: (1) In the case of target housing _ risk assessment, inspection, and abatement; and (2) in the case of any public building constructed before 1978, commercial building, bridge, or other structure or superstructure _ identification of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint, deleading, removal of lead from bridges, and demolition. For the purposes of this definition, the term ``deleading'' means activities conducted by a person who offers to eliminate lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards or to plan such activities. Abatement, as defined in section 401 of TSCA, essentially means any set of measures designed to eliminate lead-based paint hazards permanently. The definition of abatement in the proposed rule is intended to include activities performed by those individuals, who by design or intent, perform lead abatement as defined by TSCA Title IV. It should be noted that this proposed regulation would not require any person to abate lead-based paint, or to inspect for the presence of lead-based paint. Rather, it would establish requirements and procedures applicable to individuals and firms responsible for making a determination of the presence of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards and identifying control strategies to address these hazards. If a decision is made to conduct an abatement, this regulation would provide standards and procedures for conducting the abatement. Congress, in Title X, has purposefully excluded renovation and remodeling activities from the regulation's definition of abatement. Section 402(c)(2) of TSCA requires the Agency to conduct a study to assist in determining the extent to which persons engaged in specific renovation and remodeling activities in target housing, pre-1978 public buildings, and commercial buildings are exposed to lead or create lead hazards in the conduct of such activities. Section 402(c)(2) requires that this study be completed by April 28, 1995. Based on the results of this study and other information collected, the regulation being proposed today must be amended by October 28, 1996, to apply only to certain renovation and remodeling activities that - according to the section 402(c)(2) study and in consultation with labor organizations, contractors, and experts in lead health effects create a lead-based paint hazard. As part of today's proposed rule, the Agency is soliciting any available data that might be helpful in defining the risks posed to workers and/or building occupants during typical renovation and remodeling activities. This information will assist the Agency in the required rule revision. EPA recommends that States that are currently developing legislation for a State lead program consider including legislative authority for the future regulation of renovation and remodeling activities within the scope of the revised EPA regulations. Although the scope of this proposed regulation covers abatement activities as a means of controlling lead-based paint hazards, the Agency does not wish to suggest that total abatement is the only option for controlling these hazards. A wide variety of effective hazard control measures can be utilized. In a particular dwelling, it is possible that a variety of control strategies (e.g., encapsulation, enclosure, component replacement) may need to be utilized to address all of the lead-based paint hazards identified by the risk assessor. Complete abatement is not always the best or most appropriate response to address lead-based paint hazards. B. Homeowners Title IV of TSCA does not specifically address whether the regulatory requirements developed for lead abatement contractors under section 402 are also intended to apply to individual homeowners who conduct lead-based paint activities within their own dwelling units. The Agency has decided that its section 402 rules should apply to all individuals and firms conducting lead-based paint activities in target housing and other specifically identified categories of buildings and structures, except persons who perform lead-based paint activities at residences which they own, unless the residence is occupied by a person or persons other than the owner or the owner's immediate family while these activities are being conducted. If the property is occupied by an individual that is not the owner or the owner's immediate family, any lead-based paint activity, conducted at that time, must be conducted by a certified individual. The very title of section 1021 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, indicates that the scope and focus of this section is on training and certification requirements for contractors , not homeowners. Section 1021 of the 1992 Act added a new Title IV to TSCA. The new Title IV includes both section 402 (``Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification'') and 404 (``Authorized State Programs''). Significantly, section 1021 itself is entitled ``Contractor Training and Certification.'' There is no express requirement in the statute that homeowners doing lead-based paint activities in their homes must be trained and certified. Nor is there any such indication in the legislative history. The section 402(a) requirement that all abatements in target housing be performed by certified contractors has been interpreted by EPA to mean that a homeowner who hires a contractor to do abatement in his home must hire a contractor who is certified. EPA does not interpret this requirement to mean that uncertified homeowners cannot do their own abatements. While EPA recognizes it might be possible to draw a different inference from the above-referenced certified contractor language of section 402(a) as it stands alone, the Agency believes that the Congressional focus on regulating contractor activity evidenced by the reference in section 1021's title to ``contractors'' as well as certain other language in sections 402(c)(3) and 406(b) requiring persons who perform renovation of target housing for compensation (e.g. ``contractors'') to provide safety pamphlets to owners and occupants creates enough ambiguity with respect to Congressional intent that such an inference need not be drawn. For example, in section 402(c), as discussed earlier in this preamble, Congress recognized that more needed to be learned about the risks from renovation and remodelling activities before subjecting such activities to regulation. Following the completion, by April 1995, of a study of the risks created by renovation and remodelling activities, Congress has required EPA to revise the section 402(a) regulations to apply them to those renovation and remodeling activities which create lead hazards. In section 402(c), Congress told EPA what factors to consider ``[i]n determining which contractors are engaged in such activities'' and required that, if EPA determines that ``any category of contractor '' does not require certification, EPA shall publish an explanation. Again, because of the fact that the Statute specifically mentions `` contractors '' and not ``homeowners,'' it is EPA's interpretation of section 402(c)(3) that Congress' focus was on the need to regulate contractors doing renovation and remodeling activities, and not homeowners doing renovation and remodeling of their own homes. EPA assumes that in writing section 402(c), Congress did not direct that homeowners ultimately be regulated under section 402(a) because Congress never intended homeowners doing abatements in their own homes to be covered by section 402(a) in the first place. Indeed, homeowners working in their own homes are more likely to be engaged in the sort of activities described in the definition of ``interim controls,'' which activities require neither training nor certification. While EPA recognizes that the universe of potentially regulated entities is broader than just contractors and homeowners doing their own abatements, EPA has decided to exclude only the latter category of individuals from the scope of these regulations. EPA has chosen to draft this exclusion narrowly because it recognizes the potential health and environmental hazards that could result from improperly performed abatements and wants to minimize such hazards. However, EPA invites comment on the scope of this exclusion as drafted and specifically on whether other categories of individuals or groups (e.g. renters abating their own apartments or volunteer organizations that do renovation work) should also be excluded. EPA is, however, concerned about the potential exposures to lead which an untrained and uncertified homeowner may cause to himself/herself and other family members as a result of work done. As a result of this concern, EPA strongly encourages States to consider whether they wish to use their own legal authority to regulate work done by the homeowner. For example, States may wish to consider the inclusion of standards for lead-based paint activities in appropriate building codes. This approach could mirror other State and local regulatory programs already used to control other work done in homes such as electrical and plumbing work. In addition to encouraging States to consider programs with the authority to regulate homeowners, EPA plans an aggressive awareness campaign directed at homeowners. This program will include not only the design and distribution of informational materials, but the Agency also intends to develop seminars to alert homeowners to the potential hazards associated with lead-based paint activities. C. Building Types In defining lead-based paint activities, section 402(b) of TSCA categorized target housing singly, and public buildings, commercial buildings, and superstructures (e.g., bridges and watertowers) together. Lead-based paint activities conducted in target housing are identified in 402(b) as risk assessment, inspection, and abatement. For public buildings, commercial buildings, and superstructures, 402(b) defines lead-based paint activities as: the identification of lead-based paint and materials containing lead-based paint; deleading; removal of lead from bridges; and demolition. The Agency is proposing to group public building and target housing activities together as one category, and to group commercial building and superstructure activities together as a second category. Target housing is defined in the proposed regulation and in section 1004 of Title X to mean ``any housing constructed prior to 1978 except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities) or any 0-bedroom dwelling.'' Public buildings are not defined under Title X. EPA is proposing to define a public building as any building built before 1978, that is generally open to the public or occupied or visited by children. For example schools, daycare centers, museums, airports, hospitals, stores, convention centers, and federal and other government facilities are all considered to be public buildings. It should be noted that all federal facilities, regardless of whether they are target housing, public buildings, commercial building, or steel structures are specifically covered under this regulation, as directed by TSCA section 408. EPA is proposing to define a commercial building as any building used primarily for commercial or industrial activity, which is generally not open to the public, or occupied or visited by children, including but not limited to, warehouses, factories, storage facilities, aircraft hangers, garages, and wholesale distribution facilities. Under TSCA, section 402(b) the only example of a superstructure listed is a bridge, but drawing on the common meaning of superstructure, EPA is proposing to include other structures such as watertowers, aboveground storage tanks, oil refineries, utility and other structures. The Agency's determination to group target housing and public buildings together is based on two factors. One factor is that the potential for lead exposure in a public building setting, such as a museum, school, or daycare center, is similar to the potential for lead exposure to children in target housing, where families and children reside. Consequently, EPA is proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in public buildings that have the same degree of protectiveness as those for target housing. The second factor in EPA's decision to propose separate categories is due to differences in the structural design and building materials that are commonly used in target housing/public buildings and those used in commercial buildings/superstructures. For example, the structural design and building materials (e.g., wallboard, ceiling tiles, flooring materials, wooden doorways, and window frames) found in public buildings are often similar to those found in target housing. Commercial buildings and superstructures, on the other hand, typically are constructed of metal, such as structural steel. Work practices for the conduct of lead-based paint activities also differ for the aforementioned categories. The building materials in commercial buildings and superstructures require work practices for deleading activities that are very different than activities associated with lead abatement in target housing or public buildings. For example, the deleading of a watertower or industrial warehouse calls for sophisticated rigging and scaffolding equipment and the erection of containment structures. These methods are not applicable to the abatement of lead-based paint in target housing or public buildings. Given these differences, as well as information supplied by the professional community on deleading steel structures and commercial buildings, the Agency believes there is little crossover between workers practicing in the target housing/public buildings realm and those in the commercial building/steel structures realm. Rather, evidence suggests that individuals are either working in the abatement of target housing and public buildings, or in the deleading of commercial buildings and steel structures. In drafting this proposal, the Agency considered information provided by several professional groups whose members perform work in commercial buildings and superstructures. Based on this information, it appears that a broader range of tasks are practiced by fewer categories of individuals working these structures. Consequently only two accreditation disciplines (supervisor and worker) have been established for individuals working in commercial buildings and superstructures. Therefore, this proposal would establish the following certification disciplines: inspector technician, inspector/risk assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target housing and public buildings; and supervisor and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. EPA is also proposing standards for lead-based paint activities in three separate categories of facilities. These categories include target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public buildings, covers the identification of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition. The final set of standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings and superstructures. The Agency is requesting comment on its proposed definition of public buildings and its proposal to regulate them in a fashion similar to target housing. Specifically, the Agency is interested in comment on whether the universe of building types covered under the proposed definition of public buildings comprise the appropriate range of building types. Further, the Agency is interested in comment on an alternative strategy that would decrease the number of public building types that should be regulated in a fashion similar to target housing. D. Section 403 As part of the Lead-Based Paint Exposure Reduction Act, sections 402 and 404 represent just two of the many mandates that EPA is working under to address the issue of lead exposure. Section 403 of TSCA is one of these other mandates. That section requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent EPA's determination of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil, and dust that would result in adverse human health effects. EPA expects the findings of this rule will be one of the most widely used tools to assist persons who will make the decisions on whether and how to reduce risk from lead-based paint, soil, and dust. Title IV established the same 18&hyph;month deadline for promulgation of the section 403 rule as for the rules under sections 402 and 404. At this time, the Agency is still developing its proposed regulation under section 403. While the 403 rule, when promulgated, will be important for the lead exposure reduction program, it must be emphasized that it is essentially a source of guidance for the decisionmaker. This is in contrast to today's proposed rule under sections 402 and 404, which is an infrastructure and ``how to'' type of rule. When promulgated, today's proposal will develop an infrastructure of training, certification, and standards for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The 403 rule will identify conditions resulting in adverse human health effects which may be eliminated pursuant to the standards and requirements contained in the 402 and 404 rule. When promulgated, the section 403 rule will be an important part of the federal lead exposure reduction program. However, it should be noted that the absence of the proposed section 403 rule at this time does not, in the Agency's opinion, significantly impair the public's ability to meaningfully comment on today's proposal. This is because the identification at a later date in the section 403 rule levels of lead that would result in adverse human health effects, is not expected to have a significant impact on the development of the standards and requirements of this proposed regulation. For example, the procedures established in proposed \u00a7745.228(b)(4) of the regulatory text for the conduct of dust sampling as a part of a risk assessment in target housing are not expected to change as a function of the level established for lead-contaminated dust under the section 403 rule. Similarly, the number of course hours needed to properly train a risk assessor would probably not change due to the establishment of a particular definition of ``lead-based paint hazard'' under the section 403 regulation. In summary, the Agency believes that the standards and requirements proposed in the 402 and 404 rules can be evaluated independently of the definitions to be proposed in the future under section 403. Recently, the Agency published guidance on residential lead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil. This guidance is intended to be used to prioritize primary prevention activities that address hazards from lead in and around residences. EPA expects that these hazards will be among those that will be identified when regulations are issued under section 403. The levels and conditions described in this guidance should be used by decisionmakers' to identify lead-based paint hazards, sources of lead exposure, and the need for control actions in residential environments where children may be present. V. Accreditation of Training Programs A. Introduction Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations governing lead-based paint activities to ensure, among other items, that training programs for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are accredited. Section 402(a)(2) states that these accreditation regulations must contain specific requirements for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and planners, and other individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements must include, at least: (1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements, (3) minimum training hour requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements, and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. Proposed \u00a7745.225, Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs, describes a Federal accreditation program that EPA believes meets these requirements. Once the final rule is promulgated, \u00a7745.225 may be used by States, as defined by section 3 of TSCA as a model for purposes of establishing their own accreditation and certification programs in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA. The procedures for State program authorization are addressed in subpart Q of the regulatory text. B. Framework for Training Under the proposed \u00a7745.225(a), training programs may be accredited to offer courses for the following disciplines: Inspector technician, inspector/risk assessor, supervisor, planner/project designer, and worker for target housing and public buildings; and supervisor and worker for commercial buildings and superstructures. ``Discipline'' means a specific type or category of lead-based paint activity. For example, an ``inspector technician for target housing and public buildings'' would be a discipline. The course content, as well as the tasks associated with these job disciplines, are based principally on the definition of lead-based paint activities under TSCA, Title IV, as well as numerous comments the Agency received from practitioners in the field regarding the tasks associated with lead-based paint activities. The following represents the categories, and respective roles and responsibilities for each discipline as proposed in this regulation: Target Housing and Public Buildings: Inspector technicians would be responsible for: (1) Conducting an inspection for lead-based paint in target housing and in public buildings; (2) completing an inspection report; and (3) taking post-abatement soil and dust clearance samples. Inspector/risk assessors would be responsible for all of the same activities as the inspector technician, as well as: (1) Conducting a risk assessment and other lead hazard assessment activities (such as screening a residence for lead hazards) in target housing and in public buildings; (2) completing a risk assessment report; (3) interpreting the results of inspections, and assessments; (4) identifying hazard control strategies to reduce or eliminate lead exposures; and (5) conducting post-abatement soil and dust clearance sampling and evaluating the results. Workers would be responsible for: Conducting abatement activities in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the pre-abatement plan. Supervisors would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that abatement activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements; (2) in projects involving the abatement of less than 10 units, developing a written pre-abatement plan and an abatement report for each assigned unit; (3) maintaining accessibility at all times when abatement activities are being conducted; and (4) ensuring completion of all abatement activities according to the standards of this regulation. Planners/project designers would be responsible for: (1) Designing abatement projects for target housing buildings with 10 or more units, and all projects in public buildings; (2) preparation of a pre-abatement plan for all designed projects. Commercial Buildings and Steel Structures: Workers would be responsible for: Conducting deleading activities in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the deleading plan. Supervisors would be responsible for: (1) Ensuring that deleading activities are conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements; (2) developing a written deleading plan and a post-abatement report for each assigned abatement project; (3) maintaining accessibility at all times when deleading activities are being conducted; (4) ensuring completion of all deleading activities according to the standards of this regulation; (5) identifying lead-based paint; and (6) completing all other reports required under this regulation. In the statute, activities associated with the inspection and assessment of lead-based paint are clustered together, and the Agency originally envisioned that it would develop one job discipline to both inspect for the presence of lead-based paint and to evaluate or assess any lead hazards. In comments to the Agency, however, contractors performing work in large buildings (i.e., apartment complexes, schools, etc.) indicated that the costs associated with requirements mandating that individuals conducting inspections also be required to be trained to conduct risk assessments (as defined by the statute) were overly burdensome. Other commenters suggested utilizing individuals with less skill, education and training to simply collect the data needed by a ``risk assessor'' to evaluate lead hazards. Thus, in large settings the work could be done at a significantly lower cost while not compromising the quality of either the inspection or risk assessment. Based on these comments, the Agency is proposing the ``inspector technician'' discipline and the ``inspector/risk assessor'' discipline. The establishment of two distinct disciplines _ one as an entry level position, the ``inspector technician,'' who would only conduct inspections; and another more advanced position, the ``inspector/risk assessor,'' who would conduct risk assessments, but who also could conduct inspections _ also will enable individuals to logically progress in their profession. To foster this progression, the Agency is proposing to structure the inspector technician course so that it may be taken as a distinct course, separate from the inspector/risk assessor course. Upon passage of the inspector technician course, an individual would be able to secure certification as an inspector technician. Once certified as an inspector technician, an individual would be able to gain the work experience necessary to take the inspector/risk assessor course and to become certified as an inspector/risk assessor. On the other hand, individuals that already possess the experience and/or education requirements to become certified as an inspector/risk assessor would take the inspector technician training course and the inspector/risk assessor training course together as one unit. Upon completion of the unit, individuals would become eligible for certification as an inspector/risk assessor. By structuring the two courses in this way, the Agency also has avoided unnecessary duplication in training courses which individuals seeking to advance their careers sometimes encounter when taking additional training for other certifications. The content of the proposed inspector/risk assessor course supplements the inspector technician course and would not repeat any of the material from the inspector technician course. Another example of this approach can be seen in the supervisor and planner/project designer training courses. An individual could become certified as a supervisor for target housing and public buildings or as a planner/project designer for target housing and public buildings. However, to become certified as a planner/project designer, an individual would take the supervisor course and the planner/project designer course as one unit. Individuals seeking certification as a supervisor would only take the supervisor course, but could take the segment on planning/project design at a later date if they chose to pursue certification as a planner/project designer. Once again, the planner/project designer course would supplement the supervisor course and would not repeat any of the material from the supervisor course. The Agency received comments from a number of interested parties in reference to the need to avoid duplicative training. In response, the Agency considered taking a modular approach by specifying a core curriculum that would be common to all the categories of individuals conducting lead-based paint activities. However, EPA's review of the training requirements indicates that the only knowledge and skill elements common to all the categories are: background information on lead, health effects, and regulatory background. Because these elements would only make up one-half day of training, the Agency believes it is not practical to break out these topics as a separate core curriculum. Consequently, the Agency has proposed separate courses for each discipline. However, the Agency invites specific comments on its chosen approach and suggestions for outlining a modular approach that could be practicably implemented. Currently, the regulation requires a minimum amount of classroom time for each course (e.g. the inspector technician course shall last a minimum of 24 hours). Although the Agency feels that the advantages of classroom training (opportunity for student teacher interaction, the ability of the training provider to update or customize the course material delivery at the time of the course) are significant, the Agency also is interested and requests comment on less traditional educational methods. These alternative methods could include the use of videotape or at-home study, for the delivery of the course material. One such alternative would allow individuals to study course materials at home, and then spend one or two days at a training program facility to receive hands-on instruction and to take the course exam. This alternative would help to reduce travel expenses, may lower tuition costs, and would reduce the time that a trainee would have to miss work. The Agency is concerned however that non-classroom oriented instructional methods may not provide training of a quality equivalent to classroom instruction. Comments on the impact of quality resulting from alternative training methods taking into account the requirement for hands-on training, course test, and third party exam, are specifically sought as a part of this proposal. C. Application Process Proposed \u00a7745.225(a) describes the process a training program must follow when applying for accreditation from an approving authority. ``Approving authority'' is defined in this proposed regulation to mean EPA or in the case of a State or Tribal program authorized by EPA under this proposal, the appropriate State agency or Tribal authority; an ``accredited training program'' means a training program that has been accredited by an approving authority to provide training for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The procedures in proposed \u00a7745.225(a) would apply to all training programs seeking accreditation, regardless of when they began offering lead training. After the effective date of \u00a7745.225, only accredited training programs may offer lead-based paint activity training for individuals seeking certification under proposed \u00a7745.226. For a training program to be accredited, the program would have to submit an application and all of the documents and information listed in proposed \u00a7745.225(a)(2) to the approving authority. These documents would be used by the approving authority to determine if the training program meets the minimum requirements for accreditation of training programs listed in proposed \u00a7745.225(b). Training programs also would be required to maintain copies of all documents submitted with their application. Documents to be submitted as a part of the application would include a written statement signed by the training program manager that clearly demonstrates that the training program meets the requirements outlined in \u00a7745.225(b). The training manager would be responsible for ensuring that the training program complies with all requirements in proposed \u00a7745.225(b). The training manager must also certify that all of the program's principal instructor(s) and work practice instructor(s) meet the specified experience requirements and ensure satisfactory performance of the program instructors. Copies of the program's instructor/student manuals and the course agenda for each course must also be submitted with the application for accreditation. However, if the training program chooses to utilize EPA-developed model course materials, they would not be required to submit these materials, but only to maintain them. This exclusion is not intended to favor the use of EPA-developed materials, but to minimize the documentation that a training program must submit, and thus to minimize the paperwork burden generated by the application process. Once the training program's application for accreditation is submitted, the approving authority would have 180 days to approve or disapprove the application. The approving authority may, at its discretion, work with training programs to address inadequacies in the request for accreditation. If a training program's application is disapproved, the program may reapply at any time. If a training program's application is approved, a certificate of accreditation would be sent to the applicant. A training program may offer basic full length training courses and refresher training courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required to seek accreditation for each discipline. However, a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation to teach both the full length basic training course and the refresher training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply for accreditation to teach a refresher training course are discussed in unit V.F. of this preamble. D. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Training Programs For a training program to obtain accreditation for any of the courses, the program would have to demonstrate it meets the requirements detailed in proposed \u00a7745.225(b). The proposed requirements have been developed to ensure that all accredited training programs are offering similar high quality training courses, regardless of where the training programs are located. The training program would have to employ a qualified training manager, principal instructor(s), and work practice instructor(s) and would have the necessary facilities to teach both the lecture and hands-on portion of the course(s) for which the program would be seeking accreditation. Proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) lists the education and experience requirements that the Agency believes training managers, principal instructors, and work practice instructors would have to possess to ensure that training is conducted properly. Documents that would serve as a proof of these educational requirements are identified in proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(5). The Agency invites specific comment on the educational and work experience requirements it is proposing for training program managers and course instructors. The training manager is responsible for the overall quality of the training program from the qualifications of the instructors to the adequacy of the training facility. They are responsible for certifying, in the program application, that the program meets all of the accreditation requirements of this regulation, and for maintaining the program at that level. The principal instructor is responsible for the organization, delivery and oversight of all course materials. In this capacity the principal instructor has the flexibility to bring in experts (e.g. doctors or lawyers) to teach selected portions of the training course (e.g., health effects of lead or regulatory requirements). These experts, termed ``guest instructors,'' might not be professional trainers or practitioners in the lead-based paint activities arena, but must maintain specialized knowledge of a particular course topic. As a part of the educational requirements for training managers, and principal and work practice instructors, the Agency has proposed a 40&hyph;hour train-the-trainer course. The Agency chose 40 hours based on comments it has received from a number of interested parties. On the other hand, several parties have expressed concern to the Agency that 40 hours is an extensive period of time for a train-the-trainer course. Comments on this issue are invited, as well as the submission of supplemental information on the utility of a 40&hyph;hour course. Proposed \u00a7745.225(c) of the regulatory text lists the minimum curriculum requirements for each course. The minimum requirements are a list of topics that would be covered in each of the courses, as well as the specified skill areas where hands-on training would occur. There would be minimum curriculum requirements for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, supervisors, planner/project designers, and workers in target housing and public buildings; and supervisors and workers in commercial buildings and superstructures. The training programs would also provide instruction in the standards in proposed \u00a7745.228 for conducting lead-based paint activities. The course topics that must include a hands-on exercise are noted in the proposed rule with an asterisk. Each training program's course would have to meet or exceed the appropriate minimum total training hour and hands-on training requirements as stated in proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(7) of the regulatory text. The hands-on training hours are included in the total number of training hours. The total training hours and hands-on training hour requirements were developed by the Agency based on its experience in developing other training programs for asbestos, pesticides, and radon. In defining the total training hour requirements, the Agency also considered information it has received from the EPA-sponsored Regional Lead Training Centers, private training providers, and other university-based training providers, labor organizations, and other interested parties. The Agency is requesting that individuals who have data that would support alternative minimum training hour requirements submit that information during the comment period for consideration. To ensure trainee competency and proficiency, the accredited training program would have to administer a course test at the end of the course and conduct a hands-on skills assessment. The hands-on skills assessment would be an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hands-on training which should test the ability of the trainees to demonstrate satisfactory performance of all the specified work practices and procedures described in proposed \u00a7745.225(c). Both the hands-on assessment and the course test would have to be successfully completed to pass the course. To ensure the quality of the training programs, programs would have to develop, implement, and maintain a quality control plan and submit the plan to the approving authority for consideration. The quality control plan should be developed so as to maintain and improve the quality of the training program over time. The plan would address procedures for periodic revision of training materials and the course test to reflect innovations in the field, and procedures to periodically review instructor competency. An example of why the provisions for quality control and periodic revision of course materials are important is seen in the inspector/risk assessor course. The procedures outlined in proposed \u00a7745.228(b) and (e) of the regulatory text are critical for the conduct of risk assessments in target housing and public buildings. However, risk assessment, or determining the nature or severity of a lead-based paint hazard is an evolving field where technologies are advancing at rapid pace. The skills needed for assessing lead-based paint hazards would be addressed in the inspector/risk assessor course, so provisions for quality control and the periodic revision of course materials to include state-of-the-art advances are of the utmost importance to ensure professional competence. E. Course Test Proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(8) outlines the requirements for the course test that would be administered by training programs at the completion of each course. The course test would be representative of the topics taught in the course. Although the Agency expects most training providers to develop and administer a written course test, EPA is requesting comment on the need to make special provisions for individuals who cannot read English, or who have a low reading comprehension. For example, training providers may want to develop a course test in a foreign language, or to administer the test orally. Regardless of how it is administered, training participants would be required to pass the course test by answering correctly at least 70 percent of the test questions. Upon successfully passing the course test and the hands-on assessment, individuals would receive a course completion certificate. Passage of the course test and hands-on assessment would demonstrate that the trainee has been properly trained. F. Minimum Requirements for the Accreditation of Refresher Training Programs Proposed \u00a7745.225(d) outlines the minimum requirements that would be required for the accreditation of refresher training programs. These requirements would ensure that all accredited training programs would offer similar high quality refresher training courses. Refresher training would address the following topics: An overview of key safety practices; an update on current laws and regulations (Federal, State, and local); and an update on new technologies. The course would be a minimum of 7 training hours and would include a course test to be administered at the end of the course. The minimum course requirements for a refresher training course would serve to update an individual's knowledge and skills so they can effectively and safely continue to practice in the field. In addition to its application, a training program seeking accreditation to teach a refresher course(s) would submit to the approving authority the materials to be used for the course. This information would be submitted for each discipline for which the program will be seeking accreditation. The approving authority would have 45 days to approve or disapprove the request for accreditation and to issue a certificate of accreditation. The approving authority may, at its discretion, work with training programs to address inadequacies identified in the request for accreditation. If a training program's application is disapproved, the program would be able to reapply at any time. A training program may offer refresher training courses in as many disciplines as it chooses, but would be required to seek accreditation for each discipline. However, a training program cannot apply for accreditation to teach a refresher course unless it is accredited to teach the full length basic course. A training program may apply for accreditation to teach both refresher training courses and full length basic training courses simultaneously. Procedures to apply for accreditation to teach a full length basic training course are discussed in paragraph C of this Unit in the preamble. G. Re-accreditation of Training Programs To ensure that accredited training programs continue to offer high quality training, the Agency has proposed requirements at \u00a7745.225(e) for the re-accreditation of training programs. An accredited training program would have to be re-accredited every 3 years by the approving authority. To qualify for this re-accreditation, an audit of the training program by the approving authority may be performed at the approving authority's discretion. The application for re-accreditation shall include a list of courses for which the training program is applying to teach and a description of any changes or updates to the training facility or equipment. In addition to the application, the training program manager would sign a statement certifying that: (1) The course materials meet the applicable curricula requirements in proposed \u00a7745.225(c); (2) the training manager, principal instructors, and work practice instructors meet the qualifications in proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3); (3) the training program complies at all times with all requirements in proposed \u00a7745.225(b); (4) the quality control program meets the requirements described in proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(11); and (5) that the recordkeeping requirements in proposed \u00a7745.225(h) are being followed. The training program would submit an application for re-accreditation at least 180 days prior to expiration of its existing accreditation. If a training program does not submit its application for re-accreditation in time, EPA would not be able to guarantee that the application would be processed before the applicant's accreditation expires. H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Accredited Training Programs Proposed \u00a7745.225(f) contains the procedures that the approving authority would follow to suspend, revoke, or modify a training program's accreditation. The approving authority may, generally after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a training program's accreditation if a training program or its training manager, or other supervisor has committed any of the acts identified in proposed \u00a7745.225(f). I. Procedures for Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Training Program Accreditation Proposed \u00a7745.225(g) of the regulatory text describes the procedures that the approving authority would follow if it decides to suspend, revoke, or modify the accreditation of a training program. These include procedures for notifying the program; for conducting the hearing, if requested; and for immediate action to suspend the accreditation of any program. J. Training Program Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Proposed \u00a7745.225(h) of the regulatory text outlines the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for accredited training programs. The recordkeeping requirements would ensure that the approving authority could obtain the information necessary to audit programs and ensure that approved training programs are in compliance with all applicable standards. The training program would maintain, and make available to the approving authority, if requested, all documents submitted to the approving authority as listed in proposed \u00a7745.225(a)(ii). In addition the training program would maintain all documents specified in proposed \u00a7745.225(b)(5) that demonstrate the qualifications of the training manager, principal instructors, and work practice instructors. Student files also would be maintained and would contain at a minimum, the results of the student's hands-on skills assessment and course test, and a copy of their course completion certificate. The training program would retain these records for a minimum of 3 years and 6 months at the location and address specified on the training program accreditation application. Training programs would notify the approving authority 30 days prior to relocating its business or transferring the records. K. Training and Other Regulatory Requirements Applicable to Lead-Based Paint Abatement Professionals Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) In addition to the training and recordkeeping requirements of this proposed rule, there are other regulations that may apply to individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. Some lead-based paint activities may result in the generation of hazardous waste as defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). For convenience, this paragraph includes references to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for applicable RCRA hazardous waste generator requirements (see 40 CFR part 262), as well as references to training and recordkeeping requirements. References to training and recordkeeping requirements are specified as needed in the following discussion. 1. Training requirements . Individuals involved in projects that generate more than 100 kilograms/month of hazardous waste must be instructed in hazardous waste determination and management procedures relevant to their job descriptions. There are also RCRA training requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16 which are applicable to both large quantity generators of hazardous waste (more than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) and operators of the RCRA treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. Small quantity generators (more than 100 kilograms/month but less than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous waste are generated) must comply with the training requirements in 40 CFR 262.34(d). Individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities must be familiar with the requirements cited in 40 CFR 265.16(b), (c), and (d)(1) through (d)(4) and follow them when handling lead-based paint abatement waste. 2. Maintaining training records . RCRA requires that training records cited in 40 CFR 265.16(d)(1) through (d)(4) be maintained by hazardous waste generators to show that a generator of hazardous waste who generates greater than 1,000 kilograms/month of hazardous waste (see 40 CFR 261.3 and 261.10 through 35) has completed the RCRA training requirements. The abatement workers' RCRA training records must be maintained on-site where abatement work will be performed. VI. Certification of Individuals and Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities A. Introduction Section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of TSCA requires EPA to promulgate regulations to ensure, among other items, that contractors engaged in lead-based paint activities are certified. EPA interprets this requirement to apply to individuals, as well as firms, engaged in lead-based paint activities. The term ``certified contractor,'' as defined in section 1004 of Title X, includes (1) a contractor, inspector or supervisor who has completed a training program certified by EPA and who has met any other requirements for certification established by EPA or who has been certified by any State through a program which has been found by EPA to be at least as protective as the Federal certification program; and (2) workers and designers who have fully met training requirements established by EPA or an approved State program. Accordingly, EPA has determined that an individual performing lead-based paint activities as an inspector, supervisor, worker or designer is subject to regulations as a ``certified contractor'' pursuant to section 402. Although ``risk assessor'' was not expressly listed in the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, the function of a risk assessor _ to prepare a risk assessment _ is defined as a lead-based paint activity under TSCA Title IV, section 402(b). Consequently the Agency is proposing to define a risk assessor as a ``contractor'' in the same way that inspectors and supervisors are defined as contractors. At the same time the Agency recognizes that the term ``contractor'' may also be used to describe a firm or a company, rather than an individual. Consequently, the Agency is proposing regulations governing the activities of firms, as well as individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. Proposed \u00a7745.226(f) of the regulatory text identifies the requirements firms would need to meet to obtain certification. Under these requirements a firm engaged in lead-based paint activities would submit to the approving authority a letter certifying that the firm will only employ certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities and that the firm will adhere to the standards and recordkeeping requirements in proposed \u00a7745.228. To ensure that individuals are adequately trained and certified the Agency has developed two distinct training and certification programs. One of the programs has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities as workers and project planners/designers. The other program has been designed for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities as inspectors, supervisors and risk assessors. These certification programs are discussed in detail in units VI.B. and C. of this preamble. Based on comments received during the development of this proposed rule, the Agency is proposing the use of a national certification exam to be included as a part of the certification process for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. The national exam is included in the certification requirements described in \u00a7745.226(b) for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. The Agency believes that the administration of a certification exam would significantly contribute to the Agency's efforts to ensure that individuals are adequately trained and would encourage a nationally consistent approach to the development of a trained and certified workforce. Options for the development of a national exam and the purpose of the exam are discussed in more detail later in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble. Proposed \u00a7745.226 of the regulatory text has also been developed as a model for States to use when establishing their own certification programs in the context of applying for authorization under section 404 of Title IV of TSCA. Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any specific sequence. For example, there will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability of historical information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has been made. Under such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct of a prior inspection. Only certified individuals may conduct the lead-based paint activities defined in this proposed regulation. If a homeowner decides to have an inspection (as defined by this proposed regulation) conducted, the individual providing the inspection service must be certified. However, any lead related work that does not meet the definition of a lead-based paint activity, as identified in section 402(b)(1) and (2) and as defined by this regulation, need not be conducted by a certified individual. For instance, during a kitchen remodelling project a homeowner may decide to have the paint on only one wall in the kitchen tested for lead, by a non-certified individual or firm because such limited testing is not an ``inspection'' as that term is defined by the regulation. However, no individual or firm may perform or even offer to perform any lead-based activity, e.g. inspection, risk assessment, or abatement, as defined in this part, unless certified according to the procedures found at proposed \u00a7745.226. B. Inspector Technician, Inspector/Risk Assessor, or Supervisor Certification Individuals wishing to become certified by the approving authority as an inspector technician, an inspector/risk assessor, or a supervisor would have to: (1) Successfully complete the appropriate training course offered by an accredited training program and secure a course completion certificate; (2) meet the appropriate experience and/or education requirements and; (3) pass the certification examination recognized by the approving authority. To be eligible to take the certification examination, an individual would first have to present the required training course completion certificate and documentation of the appropriate education/experience prerequisites to an official of the examination administering body. Documents that would be recognized as proof of these prerequisites are listed in proposed \u00a7745.226(b). Experience and/or education requirements are proposed in the regulatory text for inspector/risk assessors for target housing and public buildings, supervisors for target housing and public buildings, and supervisors for commercial buildings and superstructures. There are no experience and/or education requirements proposed for inspector technicians because the EPA believes that this would present an unnecessary barrier to entry into this field. Many interested parties commented that the work experience and educational qualifications of inspector/risk assessors and supervisors should be substitutable. Therefore, the Agency, in proposing education/experience requirements, took into account its experience in developing training programs in the past (e.g., asbestos) and comments provided by a number of interested parties, such as the Regional Lead Training Centers, labor organizations, advocacy organizations, and trade organizations. Based on information received, the experience and education requirements for inspector/risk assessors and supervisors were developed by the Agency in an effort to allow individuals to substitute qualifying experience for education and visa versa. These requirements were developed to avoid excluding individuals whose experience might warrant qualification to become certified but who would not qualify on the basis of the education requirements alone. Proposed \u00a7745.226(b)(1) of the regulatorytext describes the education/experience requirements for inspector/risk assessors and supervisors. The Agency specifically requests comment on the education and/or experience requirements it is proposing for inspector/risk assessors and supervisors, and its decision not to propose any education and/or experience requirements for inspector technicians. It also is seeking comment on the administration of a national certification examination as discussed in units VI.D. and E. of this preamble. C. Worker and Planner/Project Designer Certification Individuals wishing to become certified as workers in target housing and public buildings or commercial buildings and superstructures or planner/project designers in target housing and public buildings would have to successfully complete and receive a course completion certificate in the appropriate discipline from an accredited training program. There are no experience and/or education prerequisites for workers or planner/project designers, nor would these job disciplines be required to take a national certification examination. This decision is based on EPA's understanding of the definition of ``certified contractor'' in section 1004 of Title X, which only requires training as a precondition to certification for workers and planner/project designers. The training course completion certificate issued to a worker or planner/project designer would serve as an interim training certificate for 6 months. Within 6 months the individual would submit a valid copy of their course completion certificate to the approving authority. The approving authority would then issue a final certification to each worker and project designer. This certification would be valid for 3 years. An individual would have to be re-certified by the approving authority before the certification expires. Training programs may wish to assist trainees in notifying the approving authority of their eligibility for certification. D. Certification Examination Proposed \u00a7745.226(b) of the regulatory text describes the certification requirements for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. Under these requirements, an individual would successfully complete the appropriate training course and secure the course completion certificate, and meet the appropriate education/experience requirements. After obtaining a course completion certificate and meeting these requirements, an individual would be ready to take the certification examination. The certification examination is a key component of the Agency's certification program, especially for inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors. While there would be a required test at the end of each training course, the certification examination would serve as a neutral or third party examination of the applicant's proficiency in the appropriate training discipline. A neutral or third party would administer the examination in such a way that the validity and security of the examination are maintained. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual who will be certified under this program would have a common level of knowledge and understanding in their particular discipline. It is the Agency's belief that administration of a neutral or third party examination would encourage States to enter into reciprocal certification arrangements with other States nationwide. The examination itself would not be developed as part of this proposed regulation, but would be developed separately under the auspices of EPA, according to guidelines discussed in paragraph E of this Unit in the preamble. It is anticipated that the approving authority may not always be able to offer the certification examination immediately after an individual has received their course completion certificate. To allow individuals to begin work, the course completion certificate would also serve as an interim certification until evidence of successfully passing the next available certification examination is provided. This interim certification would be valid for up to 6 months. If an individual did not pass the certification examination and receive their certificate within this 6&hyph;month period, the individual would have to retake the appropriate course before reapplying for certification from the approving authority. After passing the certification examination and meeting the education/experience prerequisites, an individual would be issued a certificate by the approving authority. This certification would be valid for 3 years. There would be separate certification examinations offered for each discipline. EPA is examining various options for the development and administration of the certification examination. One option is for EPA or a State to work with a competent independent organization to develop and/or administer the certification examinations based on the guidelines discussed below. A second option is to have authorized State programs develop and administer their own certification examinations according to the Certification Examination Guidelines. A third option is for EPA to develop and/or administer the certification examinations. Comment is invited on these options and on the feasibility of an independent organization administering the examination. The goal of the certification examination process is to give each State the flexibility it desires in fashioning its certification program, while at the same time ensuring a consistent national level of competence in the lead-based paint activities workforce. E. Certification Examination Criterion The following are criterion that, although not a part of this proposed rule, EPA expects will be followed when developing the certification examination: 1. Subject matter experts (SMEs) will be consulted throughout the development and early evaluation process. 2. This consultation will be done using oral interviews and written questionnaires devised by the SMEs in concert with testing development professionals. A job or task analysis will be performed for each discipline. This analysis will be used in the development of the initial test questions and the overall development of the topical format of the examinations, including the amount or percentage of questions for each topic covered on a particular examination. 3. A readability analysis of the test questions will be performed. Based on this evaluation, changes will be made as necessary in the construction of the test questions. 4. Complete psychometric evaluation techniques will be utilized in the initial construction of the tests. 5. A cut score workshop will be conducted to review each question in the item bank (or test bank). The SME's shall be used to evaluate each question. They would establish a level of difficulty for each question, as well as the percentage of each topic to be covered on the test. Based on their knowledge of the industry, the SMEs will provide an estimate of the number of candidates who would successfully complete each question. Once these items have been established, an appropriate, industry accepted procedure will be used to set a minimum passing (or ``cut'') score for each examination. 6. Continuous psychometric evaluation of the test questions will be used. The test questions will be periodically revised and updated through the collection of statistics regarding the performance of candidates on each question. EPA recognizes that States may wish to impose additional testing requirements on candidates. This practice is acceptable as long as the test questions used by a State do not duplicate the topics covered in the standardized certification examination, but rather are specific to State laws, regulations, and work practice requirements. F. Certification Based on Prior Training EPA is aware that when the regulation becomes effective, there will be many individuals who have, over the past several years, already received training and have been working in the lead-based paint abatement field. While many of these individuals may not believe that any additional training will be necessary, the Agency has a responsibility to ensure that individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities are properly trained. The Agency does not, however, wish to unnecessarily burden individuals, some of whom already have years of experience in this field. Recognizing this situation, the Agency has proposed at \u00a7745.226(d) a procedure for certifying some of these individuals under a reduced set of requirements. Anyone who has received lead-based paint activities training between October 1, 1990, and the effective date of the rule may be eligible for certification under these proposed procedures. To become eligible for certification based on prior training, all individuals would have to show proof of training received after October 1, 1990, and that such training included a curricula similar to the requirements in \u00a7745.225(c). Inspector/risk assessors, and supervisors would also have to document that they meet the education and/or experience requirements listed in proposed \u00a7745.226(b)(1). These individuals would also have to successfully complete a refresher training course and pass the national certification examination for the appropriate discipline. Workers and planner/project designers seeking certification under these procedures would have to successfully complete a refresher training course. In considering grandfathering, the Agency invites comment on what criteria should be used to compare prior training with the training described in proposed \u00a7745.225(c). The Agency believes that some evaluation of the adequacy of previous training will be necessary to ensure that individuals are properly trained. The Agency has chosen the date of October 1, 1990, as the proposed cutoff for prior training because this is the date the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) ``Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement of Lead-Based Paint in Public and Indian Housing'' were issued. These guidelines were the most comprehensive and accurate information on lead-based paint inspection and abatement issued up to that time. EPA believes that after October 1, 1990, the HUD guidelines were widely distributed to training programs and that many individuals received training based on these guidelines. The Agency requests specific comment on using the HUD Guidelines as a rationale and the October 1, 1990 date as the cutoff point for allowing certification based on prior training. As of July 1994, 3,245 copies of the guidelines and 231 copies of EPA's lead inspector training course, based substantially on the HUD Guidelines, have been sold. Additionally, as of September 1993, 306 copies of EPA's model lead abatement training course for supervisors and contractors, also substantially based on the HUD guidelines, had been sold. All of these materials were sold to the general public through the HUD contractor-operated distribution center, HUD User. Since the establishment of EPA-supported Regional Lead Training Centers (RLTC) in March 1992, the Centers have trained approximately 2,000 individuals in the Supervisor/Contractor Course (Ref. 8) and approximately 2,200 individuals have received training in the RLTC's lead inspector training course (Ref. 9). The RLTCs use EPA's model courses as the basis for their training classes. Again, EPA's model courses draw substantially from the HUD Guidelines. Under the proposed rules, individuals would have up to 6 months after the effective date of proposed \u00a7745.225 to apply for certification under these prior training procedures. After that date, all individuals wishing to obtain certification would do so under the process outlined in proposed \u00a7745.226(b) and (c) of the regulatory text. The Agency recognizes that 6 months after \u00a7745.225 becomes effective may not seem like an adequate amount of time to apply for certification under the reduced set of requirements detailed in proposed \u00a7745.226(d). However, when it is considered that proposed \u00a7745.225 does not become effective until 2 years and 6 months after the rule (in its entirety) is issued or ``effective,'' the Agency believes that individuals will have plenty of time to prepare to apply for certification under the procedures in \u00a7745.226(d). The Agency requests comment on the procedures it is proposing for a prior certification. G. Re-certification The Agency is aware that the lead-based paint activities field is evolving quickly in both inspection and abatement technology. Given this, under the proposed rule, refresher training would be required every 3 years. This requirement would be enforced by mandating that all certified individuals be recertified every 3 years. The Agency has chosen 3 years as the amount of time for re-certification for several reasons. EPA believes re-certification of individuals every 1 or 2 years would be too burdensome. But, it also believes that waiting longer than 3 years would not allow individuals to receive timely updates on innovations and technological advances in the lead inspection and abatement field or on new regulatory requirements. To become re-certified, an individual would successfully complete an accredited 1&hyph;day refresher training course specific to the discipline in which the individual seeks to be recertified through an accredited training program; pass the refresher course test, and submit a refresher course completion certificate to the approving authority. H. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Individuals Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities Pursuant to section 402(a) of TSCA, the approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify an individual's certification if an individual has committed any one of the acts listed in \u00a7745.226(g) of the proposed regulatory text. In addition, the approving authority would be able to suspend, revoke, or modify the certification of individuals who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15 or section 409 of TSCA. Furthermore, any individual who either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means, or (2) obtained certification from a training program that is not accredited to offer training is not considered certified for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It would be considered a violation of TSCA, as well as any other applicable provision of law, for any such individual to conduct any lead-based paint activities requiring certification. I. Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities Proposed \u00a7745.226(f) of the regulatory text outlines procedures for the certification of firms. All firms acting as contractors or conducting lead-based paint activities would have to be certified by the approving authority. To become certified, a firm would submit a letter to the approving authority certifying that the firm will only employ certified employees to conduct lead-based paint activities and that the firm will follow the standards and recordkeeping requirements in proposed \u00a7745.228. The Agency believes the certification of firms is necessary to ensure the use of a certified workforce and compliance with recordkeeping requirements. A certified firm would present the approving authority with a more manageable point of contact for administration and enforcement, as opposed to the Agency attempting to monitor the activities of every worker involved in lead-based paint activities. Additionally, the provisions for the identification of qualified firms would provide a source of information for the public to identify firms qualified to conduct lead-based paint activities in target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures. Additionally, the required certification mechanism would also provide the Agency with a mechanism for notifying contractors of new technologies and regulatory requirements in an effective and timely manner. A certified firm would follow the recordkeeping standards outlined in \u00a7745.228 of the proposed regulatory text. J. Suspension, Revocation, and Modification of Certification of Firms Engaged in Lead-Based Paint Activities The approving authority would be able to, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend, revoke, or modify a firm's certificate if a firm has committed any of the acts listed in \u00a7745.226(h) of the proposed regulatory text. In addition, the approving authority may suspend, revoke, or modify the certification of firms that have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or a criminal conviction for engaging in a prohibited act under section 15 or section 409 of TSCA. Furthermore any firm which either: (1) Obtained certification through fraudulent representation or means, or (2) fails to obtain a certificate from the approving Authority is not certified for purposes of TSCA Title IV. It shall be considered a violation of TSCA as well as any other applicable provision of law, for any such firm to conduct any lead-based paint activities requiring certification. K. Procedures for Suspension, Revocation, or Modification of Certification of Individuals or Firms Proposed \u00a7745.226(h) outlines the procedures to be followed if the approving authority decides to suspend, revoke or modify the certification of any individual or firm. These include procedures for the notification of the individual or firm; the conduct of the hearing, if requested; and the procedures for immediate action to suspend the certification of any individual or firm. VII. Standards for Conducting Lead-Based Paint Activities A. Introduction Section 402(b) of TSCA requires EPA to develop training and certification requirements for individuals and contractors engaged in lead-based paint activities. The statute also states that such regulations shall contain standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability, effectiveness, and safety. In this proposed rule, EPA has divided the standards for lead-based paint activities into three separate categories with lead identification and control disciplines specified for each category. These categories include target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and superstructures. In target housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public buildings, covers the identification of lead-based paint and lead-containing materials, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition. The final set of standards are for identification, deleading, and demolition in commercial buildings and superstructures. Although this proposed rule specifies certification requirements as well as standards for all individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, it does not contain a requirement that particular activities be undertaken in any specific sequence. There will be no requirement to conduct an inspection if, due to the availability of historical information, lead-based paint is presumed to exist and a decision to abate without an inspection has been made. Under such circumstances, the abatement may proceed using certified individuals without the conduct of a prior inspection. B. Background Documents The statutory timeframe for developing final standards for conducting lead-based paint activities under section 402(a) did not allow sufficient time to conduct extensive new studies and develop entirely new standards for the broad range of lead-based paint activities as defined in this proposed rule. However, the Agency was able to draw on a body of existing information and research in the development of these standards. In addition, during the development of this proposal, the Agency received written input from a broad range of individuals and groups who are currently working in the fields that conduct lead-based paint activities. One example of such resource material is the Interim HUD Lead-Based Paint Guidelines. The Guidelines, published in 1990, is a comprehensive document that covers all aspects of lead-based paint inspection and abatement activities. The Guidelines provided an invaluable starting point for the development of EPA's inspection, risk assessment, and abatement standards. The Guidelines are the only nationally recognized blueprint for conducting safe and effective abatement in target housing. While State and regional requirements exist for methodologies for some lead-based paint activities, no other set of guidelines has been used as extensively as the HUD Guidelines. Section 1017 of Title X requires that HUD issue new guidelines for risk assessment, inspection, interim controls, and abatement. These guidelines will be entitled Guidelines for the Evaluation and Reduction of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing . Leading experts in the field of lead-based paint inspection, risk assessment, and abatement have been consulted by HUD in developing these new guidelines, including lead-based paint abatement trainers and abatement professionals, as well as government officials from the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP), EPA and HUD. Since the development of the revised guidelines paralleled the development of this proposed rule, the Agency was able to consult with HUD throughout the rule development process in an attempt to achieve consistency between the two documents. The Agency will, when it is available, include a copy of the new HUD guidelines in the public docket for this proposed rule. C. Inspection for Target Housing The objective of an inspection is to determine, and then report, the existence of lead-based paint in residential dwellings through a surface-by-surface investigation. The data collection and reporting standards specified in \u00a7745.228(a) must be followed when conducting an inspection. Because the data collection and reporting standards are crucial to the accuracy of an inspection, an inspection may only be conducted by an individual certified as either an inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor. An inspection is, by definition, intended to provide a comprehensive inventory of all lead-based paint in a dwelling unit. Consistent with this definition, the inspection report will provide a detailed evaluation of the presence of lead in all paint within the unit. EPA is proposing to define a unit as a room, or connected group of rooms, used or intended to be used by a single tenant or owner. Section 745.228(a)(2)(ii) of the proposed regulatory text states that component surfaces with distinct painting histories in every unit must be tested. This effectively means that every unique component within a room that has a painted surface that has been deemed to have such a painting history by the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor, would have to be tested. The requirement that every unique painted surface be tested is consistent with the Title X definition of an inspection involving a ``surface-by-surface investigation.'' An inspection is intended to provide detailed information on the presence of lead in all paint in a dwelling unit, and the procedures in this proposed standard are intended to provide a framework to obtain this information. The inspection standards reflect the Agency's preliminary decision not to provide detailed instruction on how to perform specific lead-based paint identification tasks, for instance, taking a paint chip sample or operating an XRF instrument, but instead to assure that analysis information is obtained and maintained as part of the recordkeeping requirements. Because the actual methods and techniques used to determine the presence of lead-based paint (the test methods) are constantly evolving, and improvements in technology are expected to continue, the standards contained in this proposed rule do not specify the technology to be utilized for analysis, but do require documented methodologies which incorporate adequate quality control procedures. Examples of analytical technologies capable of lead-based paint testing include field portable XRF and, laboratory analysis of paint chip samples by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP). EPA does not intend, in this regulation, to specify in detail the procedures for the analysis of paint for lead content. The new HUD guidelines, provide comprehensive guidance on both XRF sampling, and laboratory analytical methods, and the procedures in the guidelines should be followed when conducting lead-based paint testing. The Agency is considering the need for promulgating detailed regulatory requirements for lead-based paint testing and requests comment on the need for such an enforceable testing regulation. The proposed standards do require that any environmental laboratory analysis to determine the lead content in paint, dust, and soil, be done by only those laboratories recognized by the Agency as being capable of performing these activities. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is widely used as a field inspection devise. The accumulated experience in use of XRF instruments has provided anecdotal evidence that they are subject to unexplained variances in performance. To date, there has been little comprehensive evaluation of the performance of XRFs under actual field conditions. Because of the questions raised concerning XRFs performance, EPA is conducting a field study of lead-based paint measurement technology. Results of this study will be used to shape lead-based paint testing guidelines which will be reflected in the new HUD guidelines and disseminated as guidance. While methodologies for determining the presence of lead-based paint may vary, the inspection standards would require that the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor prepare an inspection report that would detail the findings of their inspection and the methods used during the inspection. The inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor would have to adhere to the reporting requirements listed in proposed \u00a7745.228(a)(6) of the regulatory text. Accurate completion of the report would be the enforceable component of the inspection standards. The inspection report would serve as a guide for the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor to ensure that all of the necessary information will be obtained during an inspection. An example of an inspection report can be found in the HUD guidelines. An inspection report would have to be completed for each unit inspected. Upon completion of the testing, an inspection report would be written and would include all information required in \u00a7745.228(a)(6) of the proposed regulatory text. The inspection report would be retained by the owner of the residence or building and the certified firm that conducted the inspection for a period of 3 years. Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 requires that by October 1994, the Agency and HUD develop a regulation for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in target housing which will be offered for sale or lease. The inspection report would be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the section 1018 regulation. D. Risk Assessment for Target Housing The Federal government's commonly held definition of risk assessment defines the health effects of exposure to hazardous materials to individuals or populations by conducting a hazard identification, a dose-response assessment, an exposure assessment, and a risk characterization ( Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process, National Academy Press ) (Ref. 1). This form of risk assessment focuses on a quantitative analysis of risk to human health and does not recommend options for the management of the risk. Risk assessment as defined by TSCA Title IV, differs from this traditional concept in that the inspector/risk assessor is relied upon to not only identify lead-based paint hazards, but to also recommend options for the management of these hazards. Section 401(16) of TSCA provides that the objective of a risk assessment is to determine, and then report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings through an on-site investigation. This definition is based on the risk assessment protocols developed by HUD and the Housing Authority Risk Retention Group (HUD/HARRG) as mandated by amendments to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;242). Under the proposed rule, a risk assessment, including the risk assessment report, may only be conducted by an individual certified as an inspector/risk assessor. However, an inspector technician may, assist a certified inspector/risk assessor by taking paint, soil, and dust samples. The Agency views the role of the inspector/risk assessor as pivotal in reducing risks associated with lead-based paint. The certified inspector/risk assessor will be a trained specialist equipped with the requisite professional credentials needed to evaluate risks associated with lead-based paint. The Agency envisions that a certified inspector/risk assessor would be qualified to make a competent, and rational assessment of the location and severity of lead-based paint hazards. The procedures outlined in proposed \u00a7745.228(b) of the regulatory text provide a framework for the collection of risk assessment data. These procedures were developed on the premise that the background and required training of a professional inspector/risk assessor would enable the inspector/risk assessor to identify risks associated with lead-based paint hazards and to develop options for actions to eliminate hazards. The required training would, through the accreditation process outlined in this regulation, include the best scientific information available on characterizing hazardous levels of lead in paint, soil, and dust. As stated earlier in this preamble, the Agency is currently developing criteria pursuant to section 403 of TSCA for the identification of lead hazards in soil, dust, and paint to facilitate the risk assessment decision making process. When promulgated, the determinations made under the section 403 regulation, and associated guidance, will be widely disseminated by the Agency, and will be a required element of the training course curricula under this regulation. The standards in this regulation are intended to apply to individual residential dwelling units, whether in multi-unit residential dwelling or in single-family housing. The procedures for determining which units are to be assessed within a multiunit dwelling are not included in these standards. This decision should be made by the building owner or housing authority in consultation with the inspector/risk assessor. The first step of a risk assessment is to have the risk assessor survey the unit or dwelling to evaluate its overall condition. In buildings built after 1960 in relatively good condition where the probability of finding lead-based paint hazards is low, a comprehensive risk assessment may be unnecessary. To avoid the cost of conducting a comprehensive risk assessment, an owner of these dwellings may wish to have the risk assessor conduct a lead hazard screen before initiating the complete risk assessment. According to the HUD guidelines, such a screen employs more limited sampling and more sensitive hazard identification criteria. In general a screen involves determining overall paint condition in a unit, taking limited dust samples from floors and exterior window sills, and soil samples from bare soil. A detailed discussion of how to conduct a screen and the criteria used to evaluate the results of a screen can be found in the HUD guidelines. If a unit fails this screen, EPA recommends that a risk assessment, as described in proposed \u00a7745.228(b)(2) through (b)(9) of the regulatory text, be conducted. Failure of the screen indicates that lead hazards may be present and that a more thorough risk assessment is warranted to definitively identify the lead hazards within the unit. At this point the risk assessor would review any background information as described in proposed \u00a7745.228(b)(2). This data will contain useful information regarding the physical characteristics of the unit and residential use patterns within the unit. This information includes the age of the building or if there are children under age 6 living in the unit, as well as information on any known lead-related health problems of any occupant of the dwelling unit. Further, the risk assessor would obtain any other available information that would characterize occupant use patterns that may generate or contribute to lead-based paint hazards. Examples of this information could include family hobbies that involve lead, the location of a commonly used entryway or commonly opened windows. The inspector/risk assessor should also obtain, if available, any previous test results or inspections regarding lead-based paint or other assessments for lead-related hazards. This information may prove valuable in determining the presence of lead-based paint without having to re-sample areas of the unit. However, the inspector/risk assessor must evaluate the quality and the reliability of any previous test results. Past inspections may not conform to current standards of care, possibly resulting in an incorrect determination of the location of lead-based paint. The next step in a risk assessment is to conduct a closer visual inspection of the condition of the painted surfaces within the unit. Any paint found to be deteriorated should be tested by an inspector technician or the inspector/risk assessor according to the procedures found in the inspection portion of the proposed standards. The inspector/risk assessor should also test any surfaces that they determine may be a source of lead dust or lead-based chips. These include friction and impact surfaces such as door and window frames, or painted surfaces accessible to children such as window sills or stair treads. Dust samples should be collected within each selected unit according in parts of the living area where children are most likely to come into contact with dust. These areas include bedrooms, family rooms, and kitchens. In general, any area that children frequent in the dwelling should be evaluated for lead-contaminated dust. The HUD guidelines as well as the currently available EPA model inspector course provide detailed guidance and instruction in the collection of dust samples in residential dwellings. Finally, randomly selected soil samples should be collected by an inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor and analyzed in order to adequately characterize the lead concentrations in exterior play areas, areas containing bare soil, and along the dripline or foundation area of a unit. All dust, soil, and where appropriate, paint samples should be sent to a laboratory that is fully recognized by EPA as being capable of performing these activities. As with an inspection, the data collected as part of a risk assessment would be documented in an assessment report. Proposed \u00a7745.228(b)(8) of the regulatory text describes all items required to be included in the risk assessment report. Pursuant to section 401(16) of TSCA, a risk assessment may include ``other activity as may be appropriate.'' Based on this language, the Agency is proposing that the risk assessment report should, as a final step, identify lead hazard control strategies to address all identified lead-based paint hazards. A justification for each hazard control strategy identified must also be provided. The inspector/risk assessor should also prioritize each of the hazard control actions based on the immediacy of the hazard, and recommend a schedule to the building owner for addressing hazards. Clearly the most hazardous conditions (e.g. badly deteriorated lead-based paint) within a unit should be addressed as soon as possible, and before other control actions are taken. The risk assessment report is to be maintained by the owner of the residence or building, as well as the certified individual or firm that conducted the assessment for at least three years. This information would also be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation developed under section 1018 of Title X. E. Abatement for Target Housing Abatement is defined by section 401(1) of TSCA as ``any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards.'' The term, as defined, includes the removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust, the permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead-painted surfaces or fixtures, and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil. In addition, it includes all preparation, cleanup, disposal, and post-abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. By definition, abatement is limited to those activities that are designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards. Abatement does not include renovation and remodeling, or landscaping activities, whose primary intent is not to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards, but is instead to repair, restore, or remodel a given structure or dwelling, even though these activities may incidently result in a reduction in lead-based paint hazards. For the purposes of this regulation, the Agency will presume abatement to occur in the following circumstances: (1) Projects for which there is a written contract stating that an individual or firm will be conducting activities on or in a dwelling unit that will permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards; (2) Projects involving the permanent elimination of lead-based paint or lead-contaminated soil conducted by firms or individuals certified in accordance with this regulation; or (3) Projects involving the permanent elimination of a lead-based paint hazard or lead-contaminated soil conducted by firms or individuals who, through their company name, promotional literature, or otherwise, advertise or hold themselves out to be lead abatement professionals. The definition of abatement includes the phrase ``permanent containment or encapsulation.'' Encapsulation is defined as a process that makes lead-based paint inaccessible, by providing a barrier between the lead-based paint and the environment. This barrier is formed using a liquid applied coating or an adhesively bonded material. The primary means of attachment for an encapsulant is bonding of the product to the surface either by itself or through the use of an adhesive. The Agency recognizes the fact that all encapsulant's will degrade over time, so therefore, no encapsulant is truly permanent. Nevertheless, the Agency would consider an encapsulant to be ``permanent'' within the meaning of TSCA Title IV if the encapsulant is periodically monitored and maintained over the lifetime of the surface. The Agency is soliciting comment on the proposed requirement for the periodic monitoring of encapsulants. The permanent containment of lead-based paint would be achieved through the use of a mechanical enclosure system. The enclosure should be a rigid, durable barrier that is mechanically attached to the building component, with all edges and seams sealed with caulk or other sealant to provide a dust-tight system. As defined in this proposal, an abatement would have to be conducted by persons certified by the appropriate approving authority as a worker or supervisor. Every abatement project would require a supervisor assigned to it who has been certified by the appropriate approving authority. The supervisor, if not on-site, would have to be available by phone and able to physically be present at the work-site within 2 hours. This supervisor, as well as the certified firm they work for, would be responsible for ensuring that all abatement activities in target housing are completed according to the standards outlined in this proposed rule. Regarding project designer/planners, the Agency is including in proposed \u00a7745.228(c)(7) of the regulatory text, a requirement that they prepare a written pre-abatement plan for projects involving the abatement of 10 or more units, since the size of these operations may require a level of expertise not required in single-family, or smaller multi-unit projects. The Agency is requesting comment on the proposed requirement that a project designer/planner must be utilized to design abatement projects for units numbering 10 or more. The Agency has also considered this size distinction in development of its Interim Final Regulations to amend the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act's (AHERA) Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan to include public buildings. A pre-abatement plan is to be completed by the supervisor or project designer/planner as appropriate for the size of the work project. This plan would follow the standards for worker, environmental and occupant protection as outlined in this proposed rule. Because there may be a potential conflict of interest between those who conduct the inspection/risk assessment and those who actually do the abatement, it is recommended that the plan contain a statement that the persons or firm engaged in the inspection and/or risk assessment of a unit should not perform lead abatement activities in that same unit. This type of conflict may arise if inspector/risk assessors are in a position to receive a financial benefit by recommending that an abatement be conducted. To protect the health of building occupants, the rule as proposed would require that an occupancy protection plan be developed by the supervisor or planner/project designer. This plan should address what measures would be taken during the abatement to protect the building occupants, and what method of verification would be utilized to document this protection. In development of the plan, certain factors should be taken into consideration, for example, the length of abatement, remaining access to facilities and exits, and total area involved. In plans which require the relocation of occupants, samples would be collected, analyzed, and clearance levels met according to proposed \u00a7745.228(c)(9) before re-occupancy. An abatement project typically involves one or more of the following techniques: Building component replacement, the use of physical enclosure systems, or on-site or off-site paint removal from building components. It is the responsibility of the abatement supervisor, with possible input from the risk assessor, to determine the most appropriate course of action to eliminate identified lead hazards. Section 745.228(c)(6) of the proposed rule would require that the supervisor of an abatement job submit a pre-abatement notification to EPA or the approving authority, for their information, prior to the commencement of the abatement. In the case of an authorized State program, States may develop their own notification procedures as part of the State program. This requirement has been included to assist with targeting enforcement efforts. The Agency wants to protect against lead abatement related risks to workers, the environment, and any individuals who may remain in a unit during abatement. The Agency believes that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) May 4, 1994 Interim Final Rule, Lead Exposure in Construction, will adequately protect all workers engaged in lead-based paint abatement. The Agency is currently working closely with OSHA to ensure that workers employed by State and local governments, and therefore not covered by the OSHA regulation, will be covered under this proposed regulation in States without OSHA-approved State plans. In its interim rule, OSHA reduced the permissible exposure limit (PEL) from 200 m g/m 3 as an 8&hyph;hour time weighted average (TWA) to an 8&hyph;hour TWA of 50 m g/m 3 . The OSHA interim rule also includes a list of three categories of tasks that are commonly known to produce exposures above the PEL. The performance of the tasks within these categories automatically triggers basic protective provisions that mandate the use of particular types of respiratory protection unless air monitoring is conducted to determine that protection is not required. Although not currently part of this proposed regulation, the Agency is considering prohibiting certain work practices, due to the potential risk of lead contamination posed by these practices to workers and/or the environment. The following work practices are being considered for prohibition during the abatement of lead-based paint in target housing: i. Open flame burning of painted surfaces. ii. Dry scraping or sanding of painted surfaces. iii. The use of heat guns on painted surfaces for abatement without proper protection. These practices have been singled out because of the potential risk of exposure to lead-contaminated dust and toxic fumes. The Agency is seeking comments and/or data related to exposure to lead-contaminated dust and fumes from these or other abatement work practices. Following the completion of an abatement, post-abatement soil and dust clearance testing would have to be conducted by a certified inspector technician or an inspector/risk assessor according to the procedures in proposed \u00a7745.228(c)(9) for dust sampling, and proposed \u00a7745.086(c)(10) for soil sampling. Exterior dust and soil clearance levels would also have to be evaluated after the lead-based paint abatement of exterior walls. The inspector/risk assessor would evaluate the results of the clearance testing to determine if the clearance levels have been met. It is also recommended that there be no economic relationship between the inspector technician or inspector/risk assessor and persons engaged in abatement due to conflict-of-interest concerns. The Agency is interested in comments on the burden of requiring that the clearance determination being made by the inspector/risk assessor, as opposed to the abatement supervisor. The inspector/risk assessor should compare the residual lead dust level (as determined by the laboratory analysis) from each dust sample with the clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, window sills, window wells, and exterior surfaces, as established in the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Controls of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing. The Agency may in the future establish clearance levels pursuant to section 403 of TSCA, and if so, then these levels will be applicable. If a unit fails clearance testing, the unit will be recleaned followed by repeating clearance procedures. In addition, the hazard control strategy may need to be reexamined and appropriately adjusted or improved if clearance levels continually fail to meet prescribed levels. The potential for soil contamination, following exterior lead-based paint abatement activities, is also a concern of the Agency. The proposed approach to dealing with this problem is the comparison of pre- and post-abatement soil lead levels to determine what soil lead level should be achieved for clearance following an abatement. The testing protocol for soil in proposed \u00a7745.228(c)(10) includes the sampling of soil from the dripline and foundation areas as well as any children's play areas. To determine if post-abatement soil lead levels (using the above-mentioned sampling methods) have increased at a statically significant level, the Agency is proposing that a statistical analysis, such as a paired student T-test be used. If the soil lead levels increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then the soil must be remediated back to the pre-abatement lead level, or the soil must be abated following the standards in proposed \u00a7745.228(j). If there is no significant increase at the 95 percent confidence limit, then no remediation or abatement is necessary. Reports and recordkeeping play an essential role in tracking and monitoring the effectiveness and safety of lead-based paint hazard abatement in target housing. The certified supervisor is responsible for completing the abatement report as described in proposed \u00a7745.228(c)(12). Records would be maintained by the building owner and the persons conducting the abatement activity for at least 3 years. These records will be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements promulgated under section 1018 of Title X. The proposed soil abatement procedures in \u00a7745.228(j) of the regulatory text would require the removal of soil to a depth determined by the inspector/risk assessor and replacement of contaminated soil with non-contaminated soil. If contaminated soil is to be replaced with non-contaminated soil, the inspector/risk assessor will determine the source of soil that is to be used as a replacement. Since most soil has naturally occurring background levels of lead, replacement soil should contain levels that are not hazardous to human health or the environment. The Agency feels that the inspector/risk assessor has the experience necessary to chose an appropriate source of replacement soil. As an alternative to removal and possible replacement, the contaminated soil shall be permanently covered. Examples of a permanent covering include pavement or concrete. Grass or other landscaping material are not considered permanent covering. A written abatement report would also be prepared by the supervisor or planner/project designer, (depending on the size of the project) that provides a written description of the abatement and presents the results of the clearance testing. The abatement report would also be subject to the disclosure and recordkeeping requirements of the regulation developed under section 1018 of Title X. F. Management of Waste From Target Housing Lead Abatement Activity The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) establishes a comprehensive Federal program to regulate the handling of solid wastes under 42 U.S.C. sections 6901&hyph;6992k. RCRA Subtitle C creates a cradle-to-grave regulatory structure for the treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6921&hyph;6939b). RCRA Subtitle D governs the disposal of nonhazardous solid waste (42 U.S.C. sections 6941&hyph;6969a). The RCRA regulatory structure requires generators to determine whether their solid wastes are hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA Subtitle C. EPA has promulgated a rule under RCRA which sets forth criteria for determining whether certain solid wastes or debris are hazardous wastes. One of the characteristics of hazardous wastes is toxicity. To determine if a solid waste is a toxicity characteristic hazardous waste, it should be tested for its toxicity characteristic pursuant to 40 CFR 261.24. The Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in the leachate from the test protocol. When abating lead paint, different types of solid waste are generated which may be subject to RCRA hazardous waste regulations. EPA is concerned that the application of RCRA hazardous waste regulations to these wastes may unnecessarily hamper lead abatement. The Agency wishes to minimize potential regulatory impediments thus facilitating lead paint abatement in residences where children and other individuals may be at risk. EPA is currently evaluating options for modifying RCRA regulations so that lead abatement proceeds expeditiously while ensuring safe and effective management and disposal of abatement wastes. Under a separate rulemaking, EPA plans to issue a proposal addressing lead abatement wastes. G. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Public Buildings Sections 745.228 (a)(1) through (a)(7)(i) of the regulatory text proposes standards that would be used for the identification of lead-based paint in public buildings. Because children make up a significant number of the occupants in target housing and public buildings, which include day-care centers, schools, museums, and churches, these standards are the same as those proposed for target housing. A second reason for utilizing the same standards is the similarity of building and structural components in target housing and public buildings. Although many public buildings contain structural steel components, such as steel frames, these are covered for fire protection and cosmetic reasons with materials that are similar to those used in target housing. Given the similarity of materials presenting exposure risks to occupants, EPA believes that persons seeking to identify lead-based paint in public buildings can use the same inspection methods (such as XRF analysis) as those used in target housing. Under proposed \u00a7745.228 (d)(2), all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint would have to be maintained by the owner of the public building tested for a period of not less than 3 years. H. Risk Assessment for Public Buildings In addition to the structural similarities between public buildings and target housing, a high probability exists in certain public buildings (e.g., day care centers and schools), as in target housing, that children will be present and potentially exposed to lead-based paint hazards. Although, TSCA Title IV does not expressly require EPA to establish a risk assessment standard for public buildings, the Agency has decided for public health reasons to propose such a standard in this regulation. The Agency believes that regulating the conduct of a risk assessment in public buildings is implied in the definition of ``deleading'' in section 402(b), which includes planning of lead elimination activities. The Agency believes that without a proper risk assessment, there is no assurance that effective abatements can be conducted in public buildings. The objective of a risk assessment is to determine the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards and identify appropriate hazard reduction steps. Given the structural similarities between target housing and public buildings, this proposed regulation provides similar protocols to those required for conducting risk assessments in target housing. The Agency is specifically requesting comment on this proposed approach. Under proposed \u00a7745.228(e)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not less than 3 years. I. Abatement in Public Buildings The proposed standards in \u00a7745.228(c)(1) through (c)(9)(iv)(D) and (c)(11) through (c)(16) of the regulatory text would also be applicable to abatement in public buildings as defined by this proposed rule. Section 402(b) of TSCA identifies abatement-like activities associated with public buildings using the term ``deleading.'' Because both terms are defined in Title IV in terms of the ``elimination'' of lead-based paint hazards, for purposes of this proposed regulation, the Agency is treating the two terms, ``abatement'' and ``deleading,'' as if they were synonymous. The Agency believes that abatement activities in public buildings and methods of measuring protection for their workers, occupants, and the environment should be similar to those for target housing. Under proposed \u00a7745.228(f)(2), records would have to be maintained by the building owner and persons conducting the abatement and all information collected must be maintained by the owner of the building tested for a period of not less than 3 years. Management of waste from lead-based paint abatement activities in public buildings, including schools and day-care centers, is another area of concern to EPA. Wastes generated from lead-based paint activities (e.g., abatement and deleading) are currently, depending upon the results of the TC analysis, covered by RCRA hazardous waste regulations. As discussed in unit VIII.F. of this preamble, EPA is evaluating options for modifying existing RCRA regulations to eliminate potential impediments to lead abatement, while ensuring safe and effective management and disposal of such wastes. J. Demolition in Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures Under \u00a7745.228(g)(1), the certified supervisor would be required to collect any historical information on the uses of lead-based paint in a building or superstructure that would be demolished. The proposed standards for demolition are applicable only when the deleading of components prior to destruction of the facility occurs. If deleading is conducted as a part of the demolition activity, the standards under \u00a7745.228(i)(1) through (7) are applicable. Additionally, the conduct of lead-based paint activities would require a hazardous waste determination pursuant to 40 CFR 262.11 prior to demolition. All demolition waste would be treated in accordance with RCRA. K. Identification of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures The proposed standards in \u00a7745.228(h)(1) through (h)(4) of the regulatory text describe the standards for the identification of lead-based paint on steel superstructures and commercial buildings. Based on information received from professional organizations that are involved in steel structure deleading activities, EPA believes: (1) That maintenance and painting records are available more often in a commercial setting than in target housing or public buildings; (2) that processes for lead identification in commercial buildings would be more similar to those used in superstructures than to those used in target housing because unenclosed metal components are a primary architectural feature of commercial buildings such as warehouses; and (3) the purpose of identifying lead is inherently different in commercial and superstructure settings from that in target housing settings. Unlike target housing, the purpose of identifying lead hazards in commercial and superstructure settings is not to remove the lead-based paint because it may pose a hazard to occupants. Instead, the purpose is to identify a potential hazard to workers doing building or structural maintenance, and the environment. Paint (lead paint included) removed from components in commercial buildings and superstructures, is generally removed as part of routine maintenance on those components. The supervisor should determine if lead-based paint exists prior to starting work to minimize exposures to workers. Given the toxicity of lead, sampling to determine the presence of lead-based paint is commonly practiced prior to maintenance work on superstructures and in commercial settings. These identification practices include obtaining relevant, available historical information on the use of lead-based paint for a structure or building. Previous project specifications or inspection reports may provide the necessary information. If the use of lead-based paint cannot be conclusively ruled-out, limited sampling would be conducted by a certified supervisor according to proposed \u00a7745.228(h)(2). Since the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ban on the use of lead-based paint on bridges in 1980, many States have required the use of lead substitutes for primary coatings on bridges. Given this requirement, the frequency with which bridges are repainted raises some fundamental questions about recordkeeping requirements. The Agency is proposing that all information collected from the identification of lead-based paint on steel structures such as bridges, would be maintained by the owner of the structure tested until such a time that the structure, or portion of the structure is to be repainted. This proposed requirement is based on the variable frequency with which steel structures are generally repainted and maintained. The Agency is requesting comment on this requirement to maintain records. L. Deleading of Lead-Based Paint in Commercial Buildings and Superstructures The proposed standards for deleading of commercial buildings and superstructures are found in \u00a7745.228(i)(1) through (i)(8) of the regulatory text. Given the similarities between superstructures and commercial buildings described earlier, the Agency believes that deleading activities and methods of ensuring the protection of workers, occupants and/or individuals within the vicinity, and the environment should also be similar to those used for superstructures. A deleading plan would have to be completed by a certified supervisor prior to initiating deleading activities. This plan would address worker protection, as well as environmental protection issues. The Agency is concerned about the risk to workers and the environment due to deleading activities in commercial buildings and steel structures. As with all other abatement and deleading activities, the Agency is relying on the May 4, 1994 Interim Final OSHA rule, Lead Exposure in Construction. For a more complete discussion of these standards see the OSHA requirements at 29 CFR part 1926. The Agency is also considering prohibiting open flame burning of painted surfaces; the dry scraping or sanding of painted surfaces; and the use of heat guns on painted surfaces for deleading on superstructures and commercial buildings because of the potential risk of lead contamination to workers and/or the environment posed by these practices. The Agency is interested in comments on whether it should prohibit these practices. Waste generated when abating commercial buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations and should be handled accordingly. Recordkeeping requirements for deleading in commercial buildings or on superstructures with lead-based paint are proposed in \u00a7745.228(i)(6). The report described in \u00a7745.228(i)(6) shall be maintained by the owner or oversight agency until such a time that the structure, or portion of the structure is to be repainted. The removal of lead-based paint in commercial buildings and superstructures, could potentially affect water quality through two routes. The first route is by non-point source contamination, e.g., lead-contaminated dust that is deposited as a result of deleading activities is transported overland to waterbodies through stormwater runoff. The second route is by point source discharge, e.g., a direct deposition of lead-based paint or dust to a waterbody, or from channelized stormwater runoff. Non-point source contamination may be controlled through compliance with RCRA (40 CFR 3004(d) and 268.35(a)), which includes settled dust and debris from deleading activities. RCRA 40 CFR 268.35(a) prohibits the land disposal of waste which exceed the toxic characteristic regulatory limit for lead. In addition, guidance issued by EPA pursuant to the Coastal Zone Act Re-authorization Amendments (CZARA) section 6217(g) identifies a management measure for the operation and maintenance of roads, highways, and bridges in coastal States to incorporate requirements for pollution prevention procedures to reduce pollutant loadings to surface waters. Removal of lead-containing materials from steel bridges has resulted in inadvertent discharges of lead compounds that exceeded State water quality criteria, and showed the potential for long-term environmental impacts based on sediment sampling (``Long Term Environmental Evaluation of Paint Residue and Blast Cleaning Abrasives from the Middle River Bridge Repainting Project,'' California State Department of Transportation, 1982). Existing federal regulations on steel structural projects are being applied on a site-specific basis. However, differences between States' water quality standards and subsequent implementation of those standards indicates a need for a consistent water quality policy with respect to discharges of lead into waterways during removal of lead-containing materials from steel structures. This is of particular importance due to the number of contractors who work in multiple State jurisdictions, as well as the occurrence of bridge structures which span interstate waters. Under the Clean Water Act's (CWA) National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program and interpretive case law, paint removal devices used on bridges/superstructures, such as wet and dry abrasive blasters, high pressure waterjet blasters, and sponge-jet blasters, may constitute point sources. Therefore, the CWA mandates that NPDES permit applications must be submitted to either EPA or States approved to administer the NPDES program prior to any discharge [40 CFR 122.21(c)]. Of course, if there is no discharge or potential discharge to waters of the U.S., no NPDES permit is required. Individual sources are required to obtain permits, but EPA believes that general permits may be an appropriate mechanism to cover bridge stripping and painting discharges. According to 40 CFR 122.28 (a)(2)(ii), the sources covered in a general permit must involve the same types of operations, discharge the same types of wastes, require the same operating conditions, require similar monitoring, and be more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual permits. General permits reduce the administrative burden on both the permitting agency and the permittee. EPA requests comment on the best technologies available to avoid or eliminate releases of lead to the air, land, or water, and studies showing the amounts of releases that occur with those technologies. EPA can then suggest operating conditions or discharge limits which may be appropriate for general permits. M. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Based Paint Wastes from Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures Waste generated by the lead-based paint abatement contractors when removing lead paint from public and commercial buildings and superstructures may be subject to RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste regulations. The Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory limit for lead is 5 parts per million in a leachate derived by utilizing the Toxic Characteristic Leaching Protocol (TCLP). The lead-based paint waste generator must determine if the waste generated is hazardous by either testing a representative sample of the waste in accordance with 40 CFR part 261 subpart C, or an equivalent method approved pursuant to 40 CFR 260.21, or by applying knowledge of the hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or process used. If the representative test sample exceeds the TC regulatory limit, the waste must be managed as a RCRA hazardous waste, and the contractor would be a hazardous waste generator and must, therefore, comply with 40 CFR part 262 requirements. In addition, the training requirements for generators of lead-based paint waste as discussed in this preamble are applicable. EPA has different requirements for generators of different quantities of hazardous waste. For example, the regulations conditionally exempt small quantity generators of 100 kg or less hazardous waste per calendar month, but it is very unlikely that waste generated during the deleading or abatement work on larger buildings and superstructures would generate less than 100 kg. Therefore, many of these contractors would be classified as ordinary generators and therefore would be subject to 40 CFR parts 262 through 266, 268, and 270 requirements. If the lead-based paint waste is determined to be a hazardous waste and is captured, it could be managed on-site, most likely through storage or treatment. This can be technically more challenging and may require a hazardous waste treatment permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 270. One notable exception is the generator. Under this exception, a generator may treat lead-contaminated waste or lead-contaminated debris in containers or tanks in compliance with part 265, subparts I and J, and within the accumulation time limit of 90 days as specified in 40 CFR 262.34 (see 51 FR 10168, March 24, 1986). On August 18, 1992, EPA promulgated the Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR) for hazardous debris (57 FR 37194). In that rulemaking, hazardous debris is defined as solid waste with particle size 60 mm or larger. Therefore, paint chips, paint dust, and sludge's would not be considered hazardous debris. As part of that rulemaking, the Agency promulgated standards for a new hazardous waste management unit known as a containment building (40 CFR parts 264 and 265, Subpart DD), which may also be used to treat waste at the generator facility without a permit, provided the waste is not held longer than 90 days. If hazardous debris is captured, hazardous debris treatment technologies that may be used include abrasive blasting, grinding or planing, vibratory finishing, high pressure steam, or water spraying to meet the performance standard referred to as the ``clean debris surface.'' Other treatment technologies include macroencapsulation or sealing (surfacial treatment) or microencapsulation (solidifying with portland cement or lime). Microencapsulation could be done in tanks or containers. Hazardous debris is subject to compliance under the LDR treatment standards. Many States are currently authorized to implement LDR requirements pertaining to lead-based paint activities under the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. N. Applicability of RCRA to Lead-Contaminated Soil Near Public and Commercial Buildings and Superstructures It is possible that, when performing lead-based paint activities (e.g., HEPA vacuum removal or sand blasting of lead paint) on public and commercial buildings, lead paint chips or lead dust hazardous under the TCLP would be released and would either fall on the soil underneath or blown down wind before reaching the ground. This constitutes ``illegal disposal'' of characteristic hazardous waste and is prohibited under RCRA sections 3004 and 3008. Therefore, individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities must take appropriate precautions to contain lead dust releases during sand blasting or when conducting activities that could potentially release significant quantities of paint dust leading to its deposition on the soil near public and commercial buildings or superstructures. If the lead-based paint that is being removed exhibits the characteristic of toxicity for lead when conducting the abatement or deleading, it would be necessary to take steps to prevent deposition on land by capturing lead-contaminated dust and debris. If the abatement of deleading work resulting in land contamination is done without a RCRA TSD permit, then this deposition would be inferred as ``illegal disposal.'' When conducting lead-based paint activities, therefore, it would be necessary to take steps to minimize ``illegal disposal'' by capturing lead paint dust. There are two issues of concern for the Agency with regard to the enforcement of RCRA provisions for illegal disposal. These issues involve the possible impacts on worker protection and how compliance can be achieved given existing abatement and deleading technologies. Comments are requested on achievable methods to protect both the environment and workers in light of existing abatement and deleading technology. VIII. State Programs A. Introduction This unit is comprised of two parts: (1) Procedures for States and Indian Tribes to follow in order to obtain authorization from EPA to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program, and (2) a model program that will serve as an archetype for these State and Tribal programs. Section 404(a) of Title IV of TSCA provides that any State which seeks to administer and enforce the standards, regulations, or other requirements established under section 402 or 406 may submit an application to the Administrator for approval of such program. Section 404(b) states that the Administrator may approve such an application only after finding that the State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program established according to the mandate of section 402 or 406 of TSCA and that it provides adequate enforcement. The procedures for submitting a State application are found in proposed \u00a7745.325 of the regulatory text and are discussed in more detail below. Section 404(d), directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which seeks to administer and enforce such a program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an authorized State program be at least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program seeking authorization, would resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program, and further, that the regulations found at proposed \u00a7\u00a7745.225 through 745.237 would serve as an appropriate model for such a State program. Therefore, the Agency is at this time proposing these regulations as the model program for the regulations developed under section 402(a) of TSCA. The regulations for section 406 of TSCA can be found at 40 CFR 745 subpart E. Proposed \u00a7745.225 of the regulatory text contains procedures for the accreditation of training programs for lead-based paint activities. Proposed \u00a7745.226 would establish procedures for the certification of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities, and proposed \u00a7745.228 would establish standards for conducting these activities. B. Submission of State Application Any State which seeks to administer and enforce the requirements of this proposed regulation or the regulation developed under section 406 of TSCA would have to submit an application to the Administrator according to the procedures contained in proposed \u00a7745.325. No other political subdivision (e.g. cities, towns, counties, etc.) other than States, as defined by section 3 of TSCA, and Indian Tribes, are eligible for authorization under this program. Following notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, EPA would approve a State application within 180 days, if EPA finds that the State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program, and it provides adequate enforcement. Before developing an application for authorization, a State would publicly disseminate a notice of intent to seek such authorization and provide an opportunity for public hearing. A State application would contain a copy of the regulations and/or legislation establishing the State program, the name of the State agency that will administer and enforce the program, as well as information on the resources that the State intends to devote to the program, and an assurance that the State has or will have the legal authority necessary to carry out the program. Pursuant to section 404(a) of TSCA, at the time of submitting such an application, the State may also certify to the Administrator that the State program meets the requirements of section 404(b)(1) and 404(b)(2) of TSCA. If this certification, or certificate of compliance, is contained in a State's application, the State program shall be deemed to be authorized by EPA, until such time as the Administrator withdraws the authorization. This certification would take the form of a letter from the Governor or Attorney General to the Administrator, and would include detailed written justification for concluding that the State's program is at least as protective as the Federal program. If the application does not contain such certification, the State program would be considered authorized only after the Administrator approves the State application. EPA invites States to submit their authorization applications at any time after the effective date of the rule. 1. EPA approval . Within 180 days following submission of the application, the Administrator would approve or disapprove the application. In the case of a State that provides a certificate of compliance, the program would be immediately deemed approved. In the case of a State application which does not contain a certification of compliance, the Administrator would approve a State program only if, after notice and after opportunity for public hearing, the Administrator finds that: i. The State program is at least as protective of human health and the environment as the Federal program contained in \u00a7\u00a7745.225 through 745.237 of the proposed regulatory text, or in subpart E ``Residential Property Renovation,'' has been proposed in the Federal Register separately from this regulation. ii. The State program provides adequate enforcement. The Agency would notify the State in writing of the Administrator's decision. Upon authorization of a State program it would be unlawful, for any person to violate or fail or refuse to comply with any requirements of such program. The decision criteria above give the Agency reasonably broad latitude in approving or disapproving State programs. Specifically, EPA interprets the standard ``. . .at least as protective as. . .'' to mean that a State program need not be identical to, or administered and enforced in a manner identical to, the Federal program. The Agency expects to receive applications for State programs that will differ in some respects from the Federal program. The Agency will make every attempt to accommodate these differences while following the statutory requirement of ensuring that every State program be at least as protective as the Federal program. Upon notification of authorization, the designated State agency within that State would be considered the approving authority for purposes of training program accreditation, certification of individuals, and enforcement of this program. If a State does not have a State program authorized under this section and in effect by the date which is 2 years after promulgation of this proposed regulation, the Administrator would, by such date, establish the Federal program under subpart Q, or subpart E, as appropriate. The Agency has received a number of comments from State representatives presenting concerns related to their potential inability to introduce legislation and promulgate regulations for an entire training, certification, and accreditation program that would cover target housing, public and commercial buildings, and superstructures within the TSCA Title IV timelines. The Agency understands these concerns and is committed to devising a program that would promote State adoption of the program. If a State does not have an approved program within 2 years, the Agency would be required to establish a Federal program in that State. However, it was the intent of Congress, and is the policy of the Agency to encourage States to administer and enforce this program at the State level. The Agency is seeking comment on how to best achieve this goal within the 2&hyph;year time frame mandated by TSCA while ensuring that all lead-based paint activities will be adequately regulated. Additionally, the Agency has received comment that there may be a need for Federal enforcement programs to be in place even before State programs are enacted and authorized. It has been noted to the Agency that there may be the potential for egregious or widespread releases of lead-containing materials by ``unregulated'' abatement actions during the interim before State programs become effective. The Agency is confident that such situations can be effectively addressed through the application of a combination of existing Federal, State and local statutes and regulations. However, the Agency seeks comment on whether some or all of the requirements of the Federal program should be made immediately effective following promulgation of the final rule, pending authorization of State programs. 2. Withdrawal of authorization . As required by section 404(c) of TSCA, if a State is not administering and enforcing its authorized program in compliance with the standards, regulations, and other requirements of Title IV of TSCA, including section 404(b)(1) and (b)(2), the Agency would so notify the State and, if corrective action is not completed within a reasonable time, not to exceed 180 days, the Administrator would withdraw authorization of such program and establish a Federal program pursuant to Title IV of TSCA. Procedures for withdrawal of authorization can be found at proposed \u00a7745.325(h) of the regulatory text. C. Model State Program Section 404(d) of TSCA, directs the Agency to promulgate a model State program which may be adopted by any State which seeks to administer and enforce a lead-based paint activities program. Given that section 404(a) requires that an authorized State program be at least as protective as the Federal program, the Agency expects that a State program seeking authorization, would resemble, in significant respects, the Federal program. Therefore, the entire Federal program for lead-based paint activities found at proposed \u00a7\u00a7745.225 through 745.237 is being proposed as the Model State Program. Section 745.225 of the proposed regulatory text contains procedures and minimum requirements for the accreditation of lead-based paint activities training programs for workers, supervisors, inspectors and planners, and other individuals involved in lead-based paint activities. These requirements include: (1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training providers, (2) minimum training curriculum requirements, (3) minimum training hour requirements, (4) minimum hands-on training requirements, (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements, and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. Proposed \u00a7745.226 contains procedures and requirements for the certification of individuals engaged in the following activities: target housing and public building inspector technicians, inspector/risk assessors, supervisors, planner/project designers, and workers; and commercial building and superstructure supervisors and workers. These procedures include specific training and, when appropriate, experience/education prerequisites that individuals seeking certification would have. Additionally, this section specifies requirements for the certification of firms involved in inspection and abatement activities. Proposed \u00a7745.228 contains standards for conducting these activities. The standards for lead-based paint activities are divided into three separate categories: target housing, public buildings, and commercial buildings and steel structures. In target housing, the standards cover inspection, risk assessment, and lead abatement. The second set of standards, for public buildings, cover the inspection, risk assessment, abatement, and demolition. The final set of standards are for industrial settings. These include activities such as identification, deleading, and demolition for commercial buildings and superstructures. The Agency hopes that this model will be especially useful to the many States that do not currently have an existing lead-based paint activities program. The Agency believes that adoption of this program would effectively reduce the risks of lead-based paint activities. However, the State program need not duplicate the Federal program in order to receive authorization from EPA. A State may choose to develop its own program, and it would be authorized if it is as protective as the Federal program. 1. Major program elements When developing a lead-based paint activities program, a State may choose to use the Federal program as a specific model or it may develop its own program. For States that choose not to use the Federal program as a specific model, the Agency has identified several major program elements below that a State program must have if it seeks to receive authorization from the Agency to administer and enforce the program. To administer and enforce such a program successfully, a State must develop the appropriate infrastructure. A State program must establish a State agency or agencies, or designate an existing State agency or agencies to implement, administer, and enforce the State program. Given the scope of the program, it is likely that more than one State agency would be involved in the implementation and enforcement of this program. States are required to identify one State agency or organization within a State (the primary agency) that would serve to coordinate the activities of these agencies. States are also encouraged to, whenever possible, utilize existing State and local certification and accreditation programs and procedures. The State program would require the certification of individuals and firms engaged in lead-based paint activities. The program would establish training requirements for individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities. The training component of a State's program would require that training be provided by an accredited training program. Proposed \u00a7745.226 details the certification program developed by the Agency which may be adopted by a State, or it may be used as a model for States developing their own certification program. The State program would contain regulations or procedures for the accreditation of training programs. The regulations or procedures would contain the following: (1) Minimum requirements for the accreditation of training programs; (2) minimum training curriculum requirements; (3) minimum training hour requirements; (4) minimum hands-on training requirements; (5) minimum trainee competency and proficiency requirements; and (6) minimum requirements for training program quality control. The State accreditation program would contain the minimum requirements of the accreditation program found at proposed \u00a7745.225 of the regulatory text. The State agency would establish standards for performing lead-based paint activities, taking into account reliability, effectiveness, and safety. The Federal program at proposed \u00a7745.228 would establish specific standards for performing these activities which a State program may choose to adopt. A State may also develop its own standards for some or all of these activities, as long as they are judged by EPA to be at least as protective as the Federal standards. For instance, at proposed \u00a7745.228(b), the Agency has developed procedures for conducting a risk assessment in target housing. The goal of a risk assessment is to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings. Proposed \u00a7745.228(b) specifically describes a method of conducting such an assessment, and a State may choose to adopt this standard. A State may also develop its own procedures that achieve the same goal. This is the case for all of the standards in this regulation. In general, the Agency has developed specific standards that States may choose to adopt, or they may utilize their own standards, as long as they are at least as protective as the EPA standards. The State agency or agencies would provide for the enforcement of the State certification and accreditation program, and establish suitable sanctions for those who fail to comply with the program requirements. This element of a State's program is essential because one of the Agency's two decision criteria for approval of State programs is the adequacy of the State's enforcement program. Before promulgation of the final regulation, the Agency anticipates developing a compliance and inspection strategy that would facilitate State implementation and provide guidance in determining that the State programs provide adequate enforcement. The State agency or agencies must have the authority to charge certification and accreditation fees. Section 402(a)(3) of TSCA states that: The Administrator (or the State in the case of an authorized State program) shall impose a fee on: (1) persons operating training programs accredited under this title; and (2) lead-based paint activities contractors certified in accordance with [section 402(a)] paragraph (1). The fees shall be established at such a level as is necessary to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the standards and regulations under this section [section 402] which are applicable to such programs and contractors. The fee shall not be imposed on any State, local government, or nonprofit training program. The Administrator (or the State in the case of an authorized State program) may waive the fee for lead-based paint activities contractors under subparagraph A) for the purposes of training their own employees. EPA will determine what fees it will impose pursuant to section 402 (a)(3) before the Agency begins to enforce and administer the Federal program in any State. 2. Reciprocity. EPA strongly encourages each State to establish reciprocal arrangements with other States with authorized State programs. Such arrangements might address cooperation in certification determinations, the review and accreditation of training programs, candidate testing and examination administration, curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, or the exchange of information and data. The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative activity and attainment of a more professional workforce as States are able to refine and improve the effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States. There are several elements of the EPA training and accreditation program at proposed \u00a7\u00a7745.225 through 745.226 that are intended to facilitate interstate reciprocity. The first, and most critical, is the certification examination. The examination would serve to ensure that each individual who is certified under this program has a minimum level of knowledge in his or her particular discipline. At the same time, the certification examination development procedures would allow a State the flexibility to either adopt a ``standardized'' examination, or develop its own examination according to ``standardized'' guidelines. As an additional element to facilitate interstate reciprocity, the Agency has proposed relatively specific minimum curriculum requirements. A third element is the inclusion of a refresher training course in the Federal program. Successful completion of a State accredited refresher course may serve as an ideal requirement for individuals seeking a reciprocal certification in another State. D. Indian Lands This proposal also addresses implementation of sections 402 and/or 406 of TSCA on Indian lands. For the most part, implementation of section 402 and 404 would be primarily a State responsibility. EPA would enforce a Federal program only if it does not approve a State program or if it finds that a State program is inadequate. While Congress did not specifically address implementation of Title IV on Indian lands, EPA has determined that proper lead abatement is as important for Indian Tribes as for anyone else. Accordingly, EPA has decided to treat Indian Tribes as if they were States for the purpose of administering and enforcing lead programs under sections 402 and 404. 1. Authority . States generally are precluded from enforcing their civil regulatory programs on Indian Reservations, absent an explicit Congressional authorization or State-Tribal agreement to do so. California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians , 480 U.S. 202, 216 and n.18 (1987). Furthermore, Congress has not created an explicit role for Tribes or the appropriate Indian Governing Body to implement Title IV, as it has done under most other major environmental statutes amended since 1986 (Safe Drinking Water Act, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, Clear Air Act). The term Indian Governing Body is used throughout this proposal to mean the governing body of the Tribe, band or group of Indians subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. and recognized by the U.S. as possessing powers of self government. There exist three principal options for effectively ensuring comprehensive implementation of Title IV on Indian Reservations: (1) Allow Tribes to apply for approval of section 402 or 406 programs in the same manner as States under this proposal; (2) make determinations on a case-by-case basis whether the State has adequate authority to ensure compliance with section 402 or 406 on Indian Reservations; and (3) make a blanket determination that States lack the authority to implement their programs on Indian Reservations and that EPA would enforce sections 402 or 406 directly on Indian Reservations in light of this determination. EPA believes that the preferred approach would be to use a combination of options 1 and 2. Under this approach a State may propose, as part of its program approval application, to ensure section 402 or 406 compliance on Indian Reservations. The State would have to demonstrate adequate authority to ensure compliance with section 402 or 406 on the Indian Reservations. The burden the State would meet to demonstrate its authority to regulate on Indian Reservations is a high one, however. This type of demonstration of State authority over Indian Reservations is allowed, for instance, under regulations for the Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program of the Safe Drinking Water Act as well as several other EPA programs. 40 CFR 125.24(b). See e.g., 45 FR 33378 (1980); 53 FR 43080 (1988). In the alternative, an Indian Governing Body could apply for authorization to run a section 402 or 406 program in the same manner as a State pursuant to the procedures specified in this proposal. Where it does not do so, EPA would enforce section 402 or 406 directly. Allowing for Tribal assumption of the section 402 or 406 program is consistent with EPA's Indian Policy and existing practice for other environmental programs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under TSCA to allow Tribes to apply for and receive authorization to run Title IV programs. EPA's interpretation of TSCA is governed by the principles of Chevron. USA v. NRDC , 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Where Congress has not explicitly stated its intent in adopting a statutory provision, the Agency charged with implementing that statute may adopt any interpretation which, in the Agency's expert judgment, is reasonable in light of the goals and purposes of the statute as a whole. Id . at 844. EPA believes that Interpreting TSCA to allow Tribes to apply for program authorization satisfies the Chevron test. While some tribes may entirely develop their own lead programs, other tribes may look to existing programs as a starting point. Today's action does not require tribes to develop lead programs wholly from scratch. For example, a tribe could negotiate a cooperative agreement with an adjoining State to jointly plan and administer lead programs that are appropriately tailored to individual reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such an agreement would be subject to the review and approval of EPA. Another possible option includes incorporating standards from an adjacent State as the tribe's own, with appropriate revisions that adapt the State standards to reservation conditions and tribal policies. Such adaptations would build on State experience and expertise and might represent quicker and less costly ways to establish tribal programs than developing tribal programs independently. This technique of utilizing small-scaled adaptations of State programs would allow tribes to build experience and expertise that could later be used to revise existing programs, if appropriate. Smaller tribes may also wish to form consortiums or create inter-tribal agencies as ways to develop the necessary expertise to administer lead programs in a cost-effective way. Aside from any formal arrangements between tribes and States, EPA notes that the objective of this proposed rule is to provide for the safe, effective, and reliable abatement of lead-based paint hazards. Therefore, EPA encourages all affected sovereigns to work cooperatively in informal capacities to protect the public health and welfare from the serious health and welfare effects associated with lead-based paint hazards. Consistent with EPA's interpretation of the application of Title IV to Indian lands, the proposed regulations would permit the Agency to make grants to Indian Governing Bodies and States to implement authorized Section 402 and 406 programs. EPA specifically invites comment on its interpretation of the implementation of section 402 or 406 of TSCA on Indian lands. E. Effective Dates State programs may seek authorization of their programs pursuant to subpart Q effective date of promulgation of the final rule. Subpart L of part 745 shall apply in any State that does not have an authorized program under subpart Q, effective 2 years after promulgation of the final rule. In such States: (1) Training providers shall not provide, or claim to provide training for certification without accreditation from the Agency pursuant to \u00a7745.225 after 2 years and 180 days after promulgation of the final rule; (2) No person shall engage in lead-based paint activities without certification from the Agency, pursuant to \u00a7745.226 after 3 years after promulgation of the final rule; and (3) All lead-based paint activities shall be performed pursuant to the standards contained in \u00a7745.228 after promulgation of the final rule. These dates should allow training providers sufficient time to receive accreditation, and for individuals to then receive training from an accredited training program and obtain certification. The Agency felt that because the standards in this regulation are being taught in the training courses, the standards should only be enforced after individuals have received training and obtain certification. Upon promulgation, the Agency will assess the number of programs that it must administer. If the demand for accreditation and certification is expected to greatly exceed the Agency's capability to approve training providers and certify individuals, the enforcement deadlines may be revised following appropriate public notice. The timelines for implementation of the various requirements of this regulation should serve as a model for State program development, and States are encouraged to adopt these intervals. F. Regulatory Assessment 1. Introduction . EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) in conjunction with this proposed rule. Ideally, when conducting an RIA, a benefit-cost analysis which measures all marginal benefits and costs of the regulation should be performed. Although it was possible to estimate the incremental costs, it was not possible to estimate incremental benefits. Data limitations prevented a complete estimate of incremental benefits: The absence of the necessary dose-response functions precluded the estimation of certain benefit categories (e.g., adult residential benefits and ecological benefits), and knowledge of certain impacts (e.g., blood-lead levels with and without training) did not allow for the estimation of the incremental benefits associated with this proposed rule. Therefore, an alternative approach was employed whereby total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) of the regulation abatements were estimated to provide a perspective on the magnitude of the benefits against which to assess the possibility of net benefits. The major findings contained in the RIA are presented in this brief summary, organized into five sections appearing below: Cost of Regulatory Action; Benefits of Regulatory Action; Benefit-Cost Analysis; Uncertainties and Sensitivity Analysis; and Impacts of the Proposed Rule. The complete document, ``Title X Sections 402 and 404 Regulatory Impact Analysis,'' is available for inspection in the public docket. Title X, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, amended TSCA by adding Title IV. The purposes of Title X included a desire to develop a national strategy to build the infrastructure necessary to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in all housing as expeditiously as possible. Further, the Title X sought to encourage effective action to prevent childhood lead poisoning by establishing a workable framework for lead-based paint hazard evaluation and reduction and by ending the current confusion over reasonable standards of care. Section 402, Lead-Based Paint Activities Training and Certification, is only one of the initiatives under TSCA Title IV aimed at fulfilling these goals. EPA is currently developing or has developed other portions of this overall lead hazard reduction program. For example, a required information dissemination program to inform the public of lead-based paint hazards in the home during renovation has been proposed under section 406. A regulation developed under section 1018 of Title X will soon be proposed and would require the distribution of this pamphlet at the time of real estate transfer, would require the disclosure of any known lead-based paint hazards and would allow the purchaser of real estate a 10&hyph;day period to conduct a risk assessment of the property. Benefits of these actions flow from providing information describing lead hazards to home owners renovating homes, home buyers, and renters. Costs of these actions include preparing and disseminating information. Section 403 of TSCA requires that the Agency shall ``. . .promulgate regulations which shall identify. . .lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil.'' The section 403 regulations will represent EPA's determination of those conditions that cause exposure to lead in paint, residential soil and dust that would result in adverse human health effects. Benefits and costs accrue from the abatement of the identified lead-based hazards, and lead-contaminated dust and soil. Although each of these initiatives have positive and negative impacts associated with them, the following narrative focuses on those impacts resulting from the implementation of sections 402 and 404. 2. Cost of regulatory action. The total estimated incremental costs associated with this proposed rule are presented in Table 1. Cost estimates are presented for two different abatement scenarios to present a range of possible costs: (1) Assuming abatement occurs whenever X-ray Florescence (XRF) Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 1 (XRF ; 1) and 500 parts per million (ppm) or more lead in soil (Scenario 1); and (2) assuming abatement occurs whenever X-ray Florescence Analysis indicates a lead in paint level of greater than 6 (XRF ; 6) for paint and 2,000 ppm or more lead in soil (Scenario 2). Lead-based paint activities take place in target housing, as well as in public buildings constructed before 1978, commercial buildings, and steel structures. Maintenance of steel structures such as bridges, water tanks, and electrical towers may also involve activities affected by the proposed rules. Estimates of the costs of performing lead-based paint activities pursuant to the proposed standards were based on a number of factors, including the number of lead-related inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities and the unit costs associated with such activities. The incremental costs estimated to be incurred in association with the proposed rule have been grouped into three categories: (a) Costs resulting from the imposition of the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities; (b) costs resulting from the training and certifying of individuals engaged in lead-based paint activities; and (c) costs of establishing and operating State or Federal programs to administer and enforce the standards, regulations, or other requirements established under this proposed rule. For each of these three categories of costs, total incremental costs were estimated separately for the first year following promulgation (1994), and the present value for a 50&hyph;year stream of costs discounted at 3 percent. (A 50&hyph;year stream was used because it was thought to provide a reasonable estimate of the average life of a home, and a period beyond which discounted costs would have little impact on total costs). Under Scenario 1, total first-year incremental costs were estimated to be approximately $1.4 billion, while total incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over 50 years, were estimated to be $10.6 billion. Under Scenario 2, total first year incremental costs were estimated at $.8 billion and total incremental costs, discounted at 3 percent over 50 years, were estimated at $6.2 billion. As may be discerned from Table 1, by comparing cost estimates for the two scenarios presented, total costs decrease as abatement cut-offs increase (paint and soil lead concentrations), since fewer structures and less soil would be abated. As demonstrated in the accompanying RIA, the standards for conducting lead-based paint activities are the main source of costs, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the total incremental costs under both scenarios, due largely to identification and inspection requirements and soil abatement. Under Scenario 1, the incremental cost of public building identification is the greatest expenditure, accounting for 27 percent of the total incremental costs in the first year of implementation and approximately 23 percent of the $10.6 billion total incremental cost. Under Scenario 2, public building identification is again the greatest expenditure accounting for 47 percent of total incremental costs in the first year of implementation and approximately 39 percent of the $6.2 billion total incremental cost discounted over 50 years. The public building identification costs associated with the nonresidential sector are high due to the assumed high level of activity in this sector during the first 3 years of rule implementation. Training costs were estimated to be approximately 17 percent of total discounted costs for each of the scenarios. Factors affecting the potential magnitude of training costs are frequency and duration of training, as well as the number of potential trainees and associated productivity losses. With regard to State program costs, EPA found the one-time start-up costs to be the dominant factor. Owing to such start-up costs, total first-year costs were estimated to be much larger than costs for any subsequent year. In developing its total cost estimates for State programs, EPA assumed all States would establish such programs. While nothing in Title IV requires States to seek authorization, the costs of EPA administration and enforcement were judged to be comparable to State costs; thus, for the purposes of this analysis, this assumption is believed to provide a reasonable representation of costs attributable to section 404. 3. Benefits of regulatory action. To most accurately estimate the benefits associated with this proposed rule, all private and social advantages of the proposed rule's requirements would need to be identified and quantified. In particular, the incremental risk reduction brought about by conducting lead-based paint activities using trained and certified individuals and complying with the standards would need to be measured and valued as incremental benefits. Such risk reduction would be the result of reduced lead exposure to residents of target housing; to occupants of and visitors to public and commercial buildings; to risk assessors, inspectors, and abatement workers; to individuals in close proximity to lead-related activities; and to the environment. The total measured benefits (i.e., benefits that have been identified and quantified) associated with complete residential abatement, include intelligence effects on infants and children, reductions in neonatal mortality due to decreased exposure to pregnant residents, and benefits to workers of avoidance of the very high blood lead levels associated with occupational exposure. (EPA also considered benefits resulting from reduced exposure to adult residents. The results of these preliminary calculations are included in the sensitivity analysis below.) Total measured benefits estimated in this manner overstate actual benefits associated with the incremental improvement imparted by the training, certification, and standards outlined in the proposal. EPA believes, however, that these total measured benefit estimates when compared to the incremental cost are sufficient to provide the basis for an informed decision. EPA requests comment, in light of the data limitations, on the value of this approach in evaluating the potential effectiveness of this regulation. Further, the Agency requests the submission of any available data that would facilitate the development of incremental benefit values for the requirements of this regulation as well as incremental benefits and costs of alternative regulatory requirements. The results of this approach are presented in Table 2. The estimated discounted total measured benefits over 50 years range from a low of $11.8 billion (abatement Scenario 2) up to $21.6 billion (abatement Scenario 1). The largest category of benefits accrue in association with children's intelligence effects, with an expected 50&hyph;year benefit of $11 billion to $19 billion, depending on the abatement scenario. Benefits realized in association with reductions in neonatal mortality were estimated to range between $.8 billion and $2.6 billion, while benefits to workers were estimated at $2.1 to $5.1 million, over 50 years. In addition, benefits to non-residential abatement workers were estimated at $34 to $49 million. 4. Benefit-cost analysis. As shown in Table 3, total measured benefits are approximately double the incremental costs_the estimated incremental costs of the regulation under Scenario 2, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, is estimated to be $6.2 billion, and the estimated total measured benefits of the regulation, discounted at 3 percent and summed over 50 years, are $11.8 billion. Given that the incremental costs associated with the nonresidential sector amount to nearly 58 percent of all costs attributable to the rule and that the data limitations so severely restrict the benefit estimations for the nonresidential sector, the base case analysis also compares total measured benefits and incremental costs on a per residential abatement basis to gain additional insight to the impacts of the proposed regulation. In an effort to minimize the impact of the above limitations on the assessment of net benefits, an additional comparison was made between benchmark total measured benefits and incremental costs for a single residential abatement. As shown in Table 4, if only a small portion of estimated total measured benefits, say 15 to 20 percent are attributable to the proposed rule, it is possible for the incremental benefits to equal or exceed the incremental costs for paint abatement activities in the residential housing sector. A similar comparison is not possible for the nonresidential sector because data limitations preclude benefit estimates for this sector. This is not to imply that the benefits resulting from nonresidential abatements are insignificant. All the benefit categories believed to result from public and commercial and steel structure deleading are identified in Table 3. Available information regarding the scope of activity (and presented in the uncertainties section below) would suggest that substantial benefits are likely to exist in the form of other worker benefits, benefits to nearby residents, and ecological benefits. The estimate of the benefits would increase if all the omitted health and ecological effects were included. Even when restricted to the limited coverage of the effects of lead paint exposure that are included in this analysis, it is possible that the measured benefits associated with sections 402 and 404 will exceed the costs of the regulations. The measured benefits of complete abatements are more than six times the incremental costs for Abatement Scenario 2. Thus if the sections 402 and 404 rules increase the measured benefits of residential abatements (using current industrial practices) by as little as 18 percent, the benefits would exceed the costs of the regulation. A benefits analysis that included the significant omitted benefit categories would indicate that an even smaller percentage increase in the benefits of current abatement practices would be sufficient to cover the costs of the regulation. 5. Uncertainties and sensitivity analysis uncertainties . The development of the estimated costs for this proposed rule relied on three steps: The determination of ``common'' practices, a comparison of these practices to the requirements of the rule, and an estimation of the cost of the additional or incremental activities. While there is a general uncertainty about all the estimates, this approach may have resulted in an overestimate of the costs. In the case of the number of samples to be tested, the analysis included costs for the full number of tests required under the regulation. Inspectors are already taking some samples, although some may not take as many as the regulations will require. Lacking information on the typical number of samples tested, the analysis included the costs for all the tests. Likewise, interviews with industry representatives indicated that very few soil abatements were currently taking place. Therefore, the analysis estimated the rate of soil abatements under the regulation based on estimates of household radon abatement. Since radon abatements are less expensive than soil abatements, this assumption may have resulted in an overestimate of the number of soil abatements and thus an overestimate of both benefits and costs. Both these issues are examined by the sensitivity analysis below. The development of the benefit estimates was also limited by numerous factors. It was not possible to include several potentially major sources of health benefits at this time. Some of the major omitted benefits include: \u2022All benefits to adult residents. \u2022All benefits to building occupants. \u2022All benefits to workers with blood lead levels below 50 m g/dL. \u2022All benefits to residents near steel structure deleadings. \u2022All ecological benefits. All of the benefits in three of the five major categories, and part of the benefits to workers, result from changes affecting abatements and deleading of public and commercial buildings and steel structures. As a result, the underestimation of benefits has its greatest effect on the evaluation of the proposed rule's affect on nonresidential lead-based paint activities. The magnitude of some of these omitted benefits can be approximated by examining the extent of the likely exposure and the nature of the resulting adverse effects. In the case of benefits to occupants of public and commercial buildings, the potentially exposed population is very large. Over one-third of public buildings built before 1980 (approximately 900,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. In addition, about 27 percent of commercial buildings (approximately 415,000 buildings) have lead-based paint at an XRF reading of 1 or greater. An equal percentage (nearly 150,000) of industrial buildings also have lead-based paint at that level. Currently, these buildings result in over one-half million deleadings per year. While the length of time of exposure for each individual building occupant may be short, the number of exposed individuals is great, resulting in potentially substantial population risks from improperly performed abatements. In addition, inadequate inspection and/or risk assessments could result in much longer-term exposures if lead risks are not identified and abated. Since the deleading of steel structures mainly occurs out-of-doors, there is a significant potential of exposure to the surrounding environment if deleading is not conducted properly. Currently, there are approximately 725,000 highway and railroad bridges, 30,000 water tanks, 75,000 petroleum and liquefied natural gas tanks, and 133,000 electrical transmission towers with lead-based paint that need repainting, and about 128,000 underground storage tanks with lead-based coatings that need removal and demolition. While this analysis has not estimated the number of people living in proximity to these structures, the large number of structures combined with the fact that many are located in urban areas means that substantial numbers of people and large areas of ecosystems could be exposed to lead. In addition to adverse human health effects, lead can impose substantial adverse effects on ecosystems. Although lead occurs naturally in the environment, it plays no known beneficial role in biological processes. In fact, lead is a natural toxicant that affects a broad spectrum of species and persists in the environment. Elevated ambient lead levels that are bioavailable can seriously disrupt population and ecosystem dynamics. As a result, lead is considered a particularly hazardous ecotoxicant. While deleading of steel structures is likely to have the greatest impact on ecosystems, improperly performed abatements in other nonresidential and residential buildings can also introduce lead into the general environment. In addition to omitting benefits to occupants of nonresidential buildings, benefits to residents near steel structures, and ecological benefits, the estimates presented in the RIA may underestimate benefits because of the assumption made concerning which residential units will be abated. The analysis assumes that all the housing stock with XRF and/or soil-lead levels greater than the scenario levels are eligible candidates for abatement, and that housing units receiving abatements are twice as likely to have young children and newborns as the housing stock in general. This second assumption captures the increased concern about lead hazards and children, and the increased benefits that would accrue to households with young children. The increased concern will likely result in increased abatement rates among housing units with children. However, there are no data currently available on which to base an estimate of this increased likelihood of abatement, and the estimate used may be low. A low estimate will result in an underestimate of the average residential unit benefits. (Likewise, a high estimate will result in an overestimate of the average residential unit benefits.) In addition, if the likelihood of abatement increases with the level of lead present in the home, which is very likely, the average per unit benefits of residential abatement will increase correspondingly. Data limitations have prevented the estimation of the relevant abatement demand and cost functions which are necessary for accurately estimating the aggregate benefits and costs of the proposed rule. Adoption of the rule will impact variables that affect both the demand and supply functions. For instance, in theory, the increase in abatement costs resulting from training, accreditation, and standards required by section 402 will be reflected in an upward shift of the supply function, increasing prices and resulting in a decreased demand. However, it is reasonable to expect countervailing forces to exist. If people perceive that abatements performed by trained and certified contractors are a better quality service than currently available, the demand for the improved abatements may increase. In addition to demand shifts as a result of section 402, informational sections of Title IV and Title X such as sections 405, 406, and 1018, respectively, will likely stimulate demand for abatements further. These actions provide information and education to consumers about the inherent dangers of lead. The net effect of these countervailing forces is difficult to predict with the limited information available. Data limitations have also prevented an assessment of how the quantity of lead-based paint activities may change with alternative regulatory options. Therefore, EPA has been unable to estimate the effect of more (or less) precriptive approaches relative to the proposal on the quantity of lead-based paint activities. The Agency solicits comments and suggestions about data sources or methods that may help in assessing the incremental benefits and costs of alternative approaches. In order to deal with this issue, it is assumed that the demand for deleading in Massachusetts can provide a proxy for estimating national demand after the regulation is in place. This is deemed appropriate since the training, accreditation, and performance requirements (thus costs) for the established Massachusetts' program are similar to that of the proposed rule. To the extent that residential abatements are mandatory in Massachusetts when elevated-blood-lead (EBL) children are identified, the adoption of Massachusetts' abatement rates will result in an overestimation of the number of national residential abatements. However, it is felt that overestimation will be minimal for the following two reasons: information from the Massachusetts' Department of Health indicates that only 10 to 20 percent of the residential abatements are a result of the presence of EBL children, and because it is likely that other States will also adopt a mandatory abatement provision for EBL children. EPA knows of no other State programs that may provide additional insights to the expected impacts on demand resulting from the implementation of the proposed rule and, therefore, solicits public comment on the existence of State programs and relevant information germane to this issue. 6. Sensitivity analysis . Six sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Two sets affecting only the costs are alternative costs of standards, resulting from alternative estimates of unit costs or alternative assumptions of the number of events; and, alternative training costs, resulting from alternative definitions of training requirements. There are two sets of sensitivity analyses that affect the benefits while leaving the costs unchanged. These two analyses explore alternative levels of benefits to adult residents of units abated and alternative value of a statistical life. And finally, there are two sets of analyses that affect both the costs and the benefits. These use an alternative discount rate, and assume alternative levels of abatement activity. The impacts of these variables on the estimated costs and benefits are presented in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. The greatest affects on the estimated benefits and costs are associated with the assumptions concerning choice of discount rate and the rate at which soil abatements will occur. Since the benefits resulting from the proposed regulation will not occur simultaneously with the costs, it is necessary to compare streams of costs with the resulting streams of benefits. This is done by discounting future costs and benefits and summing the discounted values. Two alternative approaches were investigated: using 7 percent in place of 3 percent to reflect an alternative social rate of time preference, and using a two-stage procedure that allows for the use of two different discount rates: marginal rate of return on capital (7 percent) for annualizing the capital costs; and a social rate of time preference (3 percent) for discounting the stream of annualized costs and benefits. The distinction between these two approaches rests with whether the source of funds for lead-based paint activities are displacing investment or consumption. Simply discounting the stream of costs by 7 percent decreases the total 50&hyph;year cost estimate by 27 percent. At the same time, increasing the discount rate to 7 percent substantially decreases the estimated benefits more than the cost, because many of the benefits will occur further in the future. There are potentially two separate effects of changing the discount rate. First, the benefits per abatement decrease for all the quantified benefit categories except for workers benefits and the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefits decreases for all the benefit categories (including workers). The combination of these two effects decreases the present value of the 50&hyph;year benefit stream by 87 percent. Consequently, the choice of discount rate affects benefits to a much greater extent than it does costs. The results of the two-stage discounting procedure are very sensitive to the amortization period (the length of time capital is diverted from investments). Given the uncertainties about the appropriate amortization period, 50&hyph;year discounted costs were not calculated. However, as demonstrated in the literature the two-stage results will fall between the single discount rates of 3 and 7 percent used in these analyses. One of the most important elements used in estimating the benefits is the willingness to pay to avoid a unit reduction in the risk of death, also referred to as the value of a statistical life. The value of a statistical life directly enters the calculations of the benefits of the avoided neonatal mortality, adult resident hypertension related benefits (when included), and worker benefits. The results presented in base case are calculated using a value of $5.3 million per statistical life. The standard deviation of these values is $3.8 million. A useful range of alternative values for sensitivity analysis is mean value minus one standard deviation, and the mean value plus one standard deviation. The range of alternative values of a statistical life is therefore $1.8 million to $9.1 million. Use of this range will have a significant effect on neonatal mortality benefits. However, the alternative values do not alter the overall benefit estimates greatly; the present value of benefits per abatement and of total benefits (over 50 years, discounted at 3 percent) changes by plus or minus 5 percent. The primary analysis relies on Massachusetts and OSHA data to estimate most of the levels of abatement activity, in terms of the number of inspections, and abatements/deleading, under the proposed regulation. The Massachusetts and OSHA data provide little information regarding the number of soil abatements. For estimates of rates of soil abatement, therefore, the analysis relies on information on rates of radon abatement. The primary analysis assumes a similar response rate to the presence of lead in soil as to the presence of radon in soil. In other words, 20 percent of the soil inspections that determine the presence of lead result in a soil abatement. The sensitivity analysis assumes two alternative abatement rates (84 and 10 percent) which reflect likely response rate extremes. For target housing, the lead paint abatement rate was 84 percent. If individuals respond to the presence of lead in the soil similarly to interior lead paint, then the soil abatement rate also will be 84 percent. The 10 percent alternative is examined because based on the radon abatement experience, the 20 percent abatement rate used in the primary analysis may be too high. Changing the level of soil abatement activities will affect training, standards, and state costs at an 84 percent abatement rate, the total cost of the regulation will increase by 26 percent, with standards costs increasing 32 percent. Using a 10 percent abatement rate the total costs will decrease by only 4.5 percent. Changing the level of soil abatement activities also changes the estimated benefits. The per-abatement benefits do not change from performing an interior-only, soil-only, or combined paint and soil abatement. However, the average per-abatement benefits change when the number of soil (and paint and soil combined) abatements change. At an 84 percent abatement rate, the total measured benefits will increase 30 percent; and using a 10 percent abatement rate will result in a 5 percent decrease in total measured benefits. 7. Impacts of the proposed rule. In assessing impacts of the proposed rule, EPA focussed on the potential of the rule to affect international trade and to impact technological innovation. The distributional consequences of regulation (environmental equity) were also investigated. (Small business impacts, assessed pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, were also assessed. The results of this analysis are presented in unit X. of this preamble.) With regard to international trade impacts, EPA examined the affected industries to determine whether the extent of foreign trade merited a detailed examination of potential impacts. Since the industries directly affected by this proposed rule are service industries, marketable goods would not be produced for trade. The reduction in lead-based paint hazards expected is achieved through the identification and abatement of lead-based paint structures in the United States and, therefore, will have no implications for international trade. Thus, EPA concludes that there is no appreciable international trade in these services. In assessing the proposed rule's potential impacts on innovative activity, EPA believes that certain requirements are likely to encourage innovation, while others may be a hinderance. For example, an area where innovation might be encouraged is in the case of testing to determine the presence of lead. The standards require that the presence of lead be determined by a test that produces discrete measures. While this proposed rule does not prescribe or prohibit any particular practice, it does require that certain results be achieved. Thus, in setting criteria for new approaches in this case, the proposed rule does not eliminate the potential for innovation by requiring the use of any particular method, such as XRF. The key factor in EPA's investigation into the distributional impacts of the proposed rule was the distribution of lead-based paint in the nation's housing stock. Lead-based paint is more common in older, low-cost housing units in the Northeast and Midwest. Because such housing units tend to be occupied by households at or below the poverty level, including a disproportionate share of African-Americans, these subpopulations are exposed to relatively more risks than other subpopulations. While these sub-populations would be likely to receive a greater portion of the overall risk reduction benefits of the rule, the fact that most abatements are voluntary suggests that wealthier households will be more likely to proceed with abatements. Unfortunately, data are not available to permit estimates to be made of the demand for abatement given differing household income levels; thus, the distribution of benefits and costs across geographic and demographic lines were not estimated.

Enforcement Section 409 of TSCA makes it unlawful to fail or refuse to comply with any provision of a rule promulgated under Title IV of TSCA. Therefore, failure to comply with any provisions of the final rule would be a violation of TSCA. In addition, section 15 of TSCA makes it unlawful for any person to fail or refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by section 11 of TSCA. Violators may be subject to both civil and criminal liability. Under the penalty provision of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section 15 or 409 is subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each violation. Each day a violation continues may constitute a separate violation. Knowing or willful violations of any provision of the final rule could lead to the imposition of criminal fines of up to $25,000 and imprisonment for up to 1 year for each violation. In addition, other remedies are available to EPA under sections 7 and 17 of TSCA, such as seeking an injunction to restrain violations of the rule and seizing any imminently hazardous chemical substance. Section 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates various provisions of TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as well as companies or Federal facilities. In particular, EPA may proceed against individuals who report false or misleading information or cause it to be reported. H. Business Confidentiality Pursuant to section 14 of TSCA, a person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any public comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a public comment for which a claim of confidentiality has been made must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim information in comments confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, EPA will make the information public without further notice to that person by placing the comments in the public docket for this rulemaking. I. Hearing Procedures EPA will hold an informal hearing at a time and place announced at a later date in the Federal Register . Any informal hearing will be conducted in accordance with EPA's ``Procedures for Conducting Rulemaking Under Section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act'' (40 CFR part 750). Persons or organizations desiring to participate in the informal hearing must file a written request to participate. The written request to participate must be sent to the Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The written request to participate must include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. Organizations are requested to bring with them, to the extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each of the areas to be addressed. J. Official Rulemaking Record EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;62128). A public version of the record, without any information claimed as confidential business information, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located at EPA headquarters, in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. 20460. The rulemaking record contains information considered by EPA in developing this proposed rule. The record includes: (1) All Federal Register notices, (2) relevant support documents, (3) reports, (4) memoranda and letters, and (5) hearing transcripts responses to comments, and other documents related to this rulemaking. The following is a list of documents which the Agency relied upon while developing this proposed regulation and can be found in the docket. Other documents, not listed here, such as those submitted with written comments from interested parties, are contained in the TSCA Docket office as well. The drafts of proposed rules submitted by the Administrator to the Office of Management and Budget for any interagency review process prior to proposal of the rule will also be contained in the public docket.

Executive Order 12866 Under E.O. 12866, (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines ``a significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it will have an annual effect on the economy of over $100 million annually. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations, have been documented in the public record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act (1). Introduction . The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) requires regulators to analyze impacts on small entities. EPA conducted such an analysis, including it as part of the RIA. Based on this analysis of available data, EPA preliminarily concludes that the proposed rule should not place undue burden on small business. The analysis is summarized below. (2). Impacts on Small Businesses. EPA assessed potential impacts, both absolute and relative burden, on small abatement firms in the construction industry. To examine the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small abatement establishments, compliance costs as a percentage of operating costs were estimated for both small and large firms and then compared to determine if small firms are more adversely impacted than large firms. The compliance costs consist of two components: (1) Licensing and training costs for workers and supervisors, as well as licensing costs for firms, and (2) incremental costs of performance standards for abatement procedures. These two components coincide with the two decision points faced by firms interested in performing lead-based paint abatement work (including soil abatement). In order to be a ``player'' in this industry, a firm must be licensed and its employees must be trained and certified. It is likely that a firm will incur these expenses in anticipation of work, based on its assessment of the future demand for such services, its competition, and the price it will be able to charge. Therefore, the firm may incur the costs with no opportunity to recoup them, thus decreasing its profits. The second set of costs, those resulting from performance standards, are of a different nature. The firms that do lead abatement work also perform similar work in settings that do not involve lead and are not affected by the proposed rule. These costs occur at the second decision point. They will be incurred by a firm only if it chooses to undertake a given lead-based paint job. In each case, the firm can determine the impact of the performance standards on its sales and profit levels. If the impact will be undesirable (e.g., decrease profit levels), the firm can decline the work. In this voluntary setting, the performance standards will not have an impact on the profits of small businesses. Likewise, owners of property will incur the performance standards costs only if abatements are in their benefit. A comparison of incremental training and licensing costs to the estimated operating costs for an average small firm, for each SIC group involved with lead abatement, is shown in Table 7 below. These SIC groups cover abatements in residential, public, commercial, and industrial buildings, as well as steel structure abatement and deleading. Assuming that none of the training and licensing costs are shifted forward in the form of higher prices, the ratio of compliance costs to operating costs for small establishments range between 1.2 and 3.2 percent. Cost ratios are similarly estimated for large establishments in Table 8 below. For large firms, the ratios tend to be slightly lower, ranging from1.0 to 2.3 percent. For both large and small establishments, the largest cost ratio occurs for SIC 1721, painting contractors. However, for these firms, a large non-lead paint market is available. In all cases, compliance costs equal a small percentage of operating costs. While this shifting of costs will alleviate the burden on abatement and deleading firms, the incremental costs of the regulations may affect residential and commercial building owners. Consistent with the arguments presented above, under this proposed rule abatement is a voluntary action. As such, a landlord is unlikely to undertake an abatement unless he or she is able to pass the cost on to his or her tenants or otherwise recoup the costs in terms of higher property values. EPA is concerned about the possibility that landlords of marginally profitable property, under the threat of civil suits may chose the alternative of abandoning the property rather than incur the cost of abatement. EPA solicits comments providing data or methods any such effects on the removal target housing from the market. An alternative indicator which demonstrates potential impacts on small abatement firms focuses on profitability. EPA subtracted estimated establishment compliance costs from average profits per establishment to determine post-compliance profits. This calculation was also performed separately for small and large establishments for the same SIC codes identified above assuming Scenario 1 (See Tables 9 and 10 below). The estimated average adjusted profits for small establishments in two of the nine affected industry sectors become negative. One of these sectors, Miscellaneous Trade Contractors, was assumed as the most likely to perform a high frequency of very costly soil abatement projects; thus, compliance costs exceeded profits by more than a factor of 10. For 3 other sectors, compliance costs represented more than 50 percent of abatement establishment profits. For large firms, the results of this calculation indicated the typical large firm to remain profitable in all sectors. Thus, based on the profitability indicator size of deleading firms entering the abatement industry may be impacted by this proposed rule. These calculations on profits assume all costs were absorbed by affected firms. This is more reasonable in the short run than in the long run. EPA does not have the necessary information to ascertain the cost pass through rate and resulting impacts on individual firms in the short run. Also, the analysis was constrained to use SIC data that are from a set of firms that may be different from firms complying with this proposed rule and, therefore, the financial information may not be representative of potential abatement firms. EPA solicits comments on available data to estimate these impacts. The two indicators presented above were selected to present the likely bounds of the impacts associated with the proposed rule. The actual impact will likely lie somewhere between these extremes. The comparison of impacts on small and large training providers was not performed for two reasons. Except for the RLTCs, most training providers are small, so there would be no differential effect based on size of the firm. In addition, it is likely that the training providers will pass the additional costs on to their trainees. Since the changes will be required by Federal regulations, they will apply to all training providers. Second, there will be heightened concern about lead-based paint hazards and thus a greater willingness to pay for trained personnel who will presumably provide higher quality services. In fact, these regulations are likely to create a market for training services and thus will be beneficial to small businesses.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Information Collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA (ICR No. 15 USC 2682 and 15 USC 2688) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, (2136) EPA, 401 M st., SW Washington DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. This collection of information has an estimated reporting burden averaging 2.67 hours per response while the estimated recordkeeping burden was estimated to be 0.32 hours per response. These estimates include time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather and maintain the data needed, and complete the collection information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch, (2136) EPA 401 M St., S.W., Washington, DC 20460, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. This regulation includes a number of reporting and record keeping requirements, which are designed to help EPA verify compliance with the rule after it is promulgated. This analysis identifies the reporting and record keeping requirements specified in the proposed rule and estimates the burden and cost that these requirements will impose. This regulation will add to the reporting and recordkeeping burden for three entities: states, training providers, and lead inspection and abatement firms. Where applicable, burden numbers were based on those developed for the Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP)(U.S. EPA, 1993b). In all other cases, burden numbers were estimated. Reporting burdens presented are classified into two groups: initial and annual. The burden associated with the start-up efforts of states, training providers, and lead inspection and abatement firms are referred to as the initial burden. For the purpose of this analysis, all of these efforts are assumed to be completed during 1994, the first year of the rule. The burden associated with reporting requirements that will be required on an annual basis are referred to as the annual burden and are presented based on the projected activity level for 1994. Initial and annual estimates are combined to project the burden and costs that will be imposed during the first year of the rule, while the annual costs alone serve as an estimate of the burden level expected during the second year (and subsequent years) of the rule. The first and second year burden estimates for all entities subject to reporting requirements under this rule, were estimated to two abatement scenarios of XRF ; 1, soil-lead ; 500 ppm, and for XRF ; 6, soil-lead ; 2,000 ppm. With regard to the first abatement scenario, during the initial year of the rule the burden is projected to be 11.4 million hours and $228.8 million. Assuming all entities seeking accreditation and certification are in place during the first year of the rule, the burden estimate associatedwith the second year (and all subsequent years) is projected to be 10.8 million hours and $217.6 million. At XRF ; 6, soil-lead ; 2000 ppm, the total burden for the initial year is estimated to be 6.2 million hours and $126.1 million. For the second year, and subsequent years, the total burden is 6.1 million hours and $120.9 million. The majority of the burden, for both abatement scenarios, falls on lead abatement firms and is driven by the reporting requirements associated with on-site lead-based paint activities. Because this burden is driven by the number of lead-based paint projects, it is expected to decline substantially in subsequent years. The total annual recordkeeping costs for the XRF ; 1 and soil-lead ; 500 ppm represent the worst-case scenario due to the number of events that occur. Total annual costs are estimated to be approximately $1.3 million.

(v) In each area within an individual unit, the inspector/risk assessor shall compare the residual lead dust level (as determined by the laboratory analysis) from each dust sample with the clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, window sills, window wells, and exterior surfaces, as established in the HUD Guidelines for the Evaluation and Controls of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing, unless superseded by any clearance levels that the Agency may establish pursuant to section 403 of TSCA. If any of the area's residual dust levels exceed these clearance levels, the area shall be cleaned again and retested until the clearance levels are met. If the dust levels continue to exceed the clearance levels, alternate hazard control strategies should be considered for use. Until all applicable clearance levels for lead in dust are met, the area shall not be cleared for re-occupancy. (vi) Once all residual lead levels for an area meet or fall below the clearance levels for lead in dust, and there is no deteriorated paint or visible dust present, the area shall be cleared for re-occupancy by the certified inspector/risk assessor. (10) The following procedures for determining whether soil clearance lead levels have been met shall be performed by a certified inspector/technician or inspector/risk assessor: (i) Composite soil samples consisting of at least four subsamples shall be taken after all exterior abatement work from the dripline or next to the foundation below any exterior surface abated. (ii) Samples shall be sent for analysis to a laboratory recognized by EPA as being capable of performing these activities. (iii) A statistical analysis, such as, but not limited to, a paired student T-test shall be used to determine if the post-abatement soil lead level had increased at a statistically significant level (significant at the 95 percent confidence limit) from the pre-abatement soil lead level following exterior abatement activities. (iv) If soil lead levels do not show a statistically significant increase in lead concentrations based on a statistical analysis at the 95 percent confidence limit after abatement, no remediation is required. (v) If the soil lead levels do show a statistically significant increase, above any applicable Federal or State standard for lead in residential soil, based on the statistical analysis at the 95 percent confidence limit, the measured level of lead in the soil shall be remediated back to the pre-abatement level or abatement of the soil shall be conducted according to the standards in paragraph (j) of this section.

Assessment of Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Alternatives Introduction The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources *&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating occupational safety and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard `` *&blank;*&blank;* that most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity *&blank;*&blank;*'' On the basis of this congressional directive, OSHA has responded to the Court of Appeals by issuing a final revision to the asbestos standard, the intent of which is to further reduce the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to asbestos. This chapter reviews regulatory and non-regulatory alternatives that OSHA considered and found to be inadequate for full remediation of the occupational hazards of asbestos. Private Markets and Occupational Health Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor markets where workers, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and, ultimately, by the consumers who pay higher prices for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized, private employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the cost of the expected injury or illness. The resultant level of safety and health is considered ``efficient'' in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the costs of hazard prevention and of injury or illness. Perfectly competitive labor markets, however, do not exist for many industrial markets. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions to provide greater worker protection against exposures to toxic substances. Evidence indicates that market forces have not been effective in reducing excessive occupational exposure to asbestos, thereby contributing to the development of diseases related to it. In spite of the hazards associated with asbestos, the social costs of production have not been internalized, in part because of market imperfections and the existence of externalities. Consequently, the amount of protection that the private market will offer to workers differs from the socially desired level, for the following reasons. First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that, in the absence of immediate or clear-cut danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term effects of exposure. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might still find informed decision making a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development of disease. Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related or could have other causes_employees and employers may not link disease with exposure. Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to asbestos, many face limited employment options. Non-transferability of occupational skills and high regional unemployment rates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily. A worker employed in resurfacing automobile brakes, for example, could find it difficult to apply occupational skills to a new job in searching for a safer workplace. In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better paying but more hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay and risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. In addition to the market imperfections, externalities result in employers and employees settling for an inefficiently low level of protection from toxic substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced diseases, including the costs of premature death, excess sickness, and disability. Individuals who suffer from occupationally related illness are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. These combined factors of labor market imperfections and the existence of externalities prevent the market from delivering an optimal supply of healthful working conditions in industries where asbestos hazards exist. Tort Liability and Asbestos Litigation Greater reliance on the use of liability under tort law is one of the examples of a non-regulatory alternative identified and set forth by the Office of Management and Budget guidelines for implementing Executive Orders 12866 and 12291. Prosser [Prosser, 1971] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages,'' although he says that ``a really satisfactory definition has yet to be found.'' If the tort system effectively applied, it would allow a worker whose health has been adversely affected by occupational exposure to asbestos to sue and recover damages from the employer. Furthermore, the tort system would shift the liability of direct costs of occupational disease from the worker to the firm under certain specific circumstances. The tort system has had limited success in shifting the cost of occupational disease. The limitations of the system are discussed in the following paragraphs. Asbestos product liability litigation as a means of reducing worker exposure to asbestos has proven effective in some areas, but cumbersome to resolve. The difficulties are inherent in the litigation process as it relates to asbestos products and in the nature of the diseases associated with asbestos. With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viable alternative in dealings between employees and their employers. All states have legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusive or principal remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus, tort law can only be applied to third-party suppliers of a hazardous substance. It is often difficult, however, to demonstrate cause, which is a necessary prerequisite for the successful application of tort liability against these suppliers.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940810-0-00148", "score": 7.511199951171875}, {"content": "Title: Content: September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition OPPOSITION EXPECTED TO WASTE SITE NEAR SCHOOL; POLLUTION: THE STATE AND THE EPA PROPOSE TO ISSUE PERMITS TO BUILD A PLANT TO TREAT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LESS THAN A BLOCK FROM HOMES AND HUNTINGTON PARK HIGH. A proposal to build a plant to treat hazardous waste less than a block from homes and Huntington Park High School is expected to draw strong opposition during a public hearing Tuesday night at the school. The state Department of Health Services and the Environmental Protection Agency are proposing to issue permits to Chem-Clear Inc. that would allow the firm to treat daily up to 120,000 gallons of hazardous industrial waste. After the hearing, state and federal officials will decide whether to issue the permit or to require that changes be made in the operation of the proposed plant. The plant would be built in an abandoned factory at Slauson and Boyle avenues in heavily industrial Vernon. The site is on Huntington Park's northern border, a stone's throw from the school and homes. Residents, students, state legislators and even the Los Angeles Board of Education have opposed the plant since the proposal came under public scrutiny about two years ago. Industrial wastes, including hexavalent chromium, acids and other hazardous chemicals from Los Angeles area factories, would be hauled to the facility by tanker on freeways and city streets. Water would be separated from the materials and disposed of by sewer. Sludge containing hazardous metals and other materials would be hauled to a landfill in Utah. Huntington Park High health teacher Richard Loya is one of the plan's most vocal foes. He has taught his students about the potential dangers of the facility. \"As a teacher, I have to be concerned about the safety of my kids, and this is adding extra risk,\" Loya said. \"Do we need that added risk in this area, especially right across the street from the school?\" But a spokesman for Chem-Clear, which is owned by a subsidiary of Union Pacific Railroad, said the plant would enable area factories to dispose of their waste safely, rather than store it in leaky barrels or dumping the waste illegally. \"There's a need for a facility like this, to get this stuff, deal with it and get it out of the community,\" Chem-Clear spokesman Xavier Hermosillo said. A study by a private firm assessing the health risks the plant would pose has been completed since the last public hearing was held in July, 1988. The study, sure to be the focus of Tuesday night's hearing, indicates that plant emissions would not pose a substantial risk. The plant would not incinerate wastes but would emit minute amounts of hazardous chemicals during processing. Depending on the waste treated, those emissions could include tiny amounts of such chemicals as benzene, a carcinogen. The study indicated that such emissions would cause, at most, fewer than one additional case of cancer per million people -- well within the range considered acceptable by state health officials. \"We don't feel that anyone would be at risk from breathing the air,\" said Florence Pearson, senior hazardous materials specialist for the state Department of Health Services. But the study indicated that a spill at the facility or by a truck hauling hazardous waste could cause injuries. One scenario cited by the study would be a spill from a 25,000-gallon drum containing waste that is 18% hydrochloric acid, the maximum concentration of hydrochloric acid that would be allowed in waste processed at the facility. Dikes would contain the spill but vapors would escape into the air. Such a spill is an extremely unlikely, worst-case scenario, the study said. \"Any individual located in the immediate vicinity of or directly downwind and close to the accident site would be likely to suffer serious adverse health effects,\" the study said. Those effects could include burns to the nose, throat, lungs and skin, and even death. In such a spill, vapors could reach the school, the study said. But Pearson, the state specialist on hazardous materials, said: \"There are a tremendous number of safeguards that are built into the process that would prevent this from happening.\" Up to 8,000 gallons of flammable waste would be stored at the site in a special room designed to keep a fire from spreading, the report said. The study cited many variables and did not predict what sort of health risks would result from toxic smoke produced from such a fire. Hermosillo, the Chem-Clear spokesman, said the firm has made some concessions because of public concern. For example, Chem-Clear dropped plans to treat cyanide waste, although the proposed permit would allow cyanide waste to be stored at the facility before being transported to the Utah landfill. But those concessions have not yet won over foes such as Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), who are concerned about the proliferation of such plants in populated areas. \"I'm still not convinced that it's not going to pose some danger to the existing school that's right across the street,\" she said. The hearing begins at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Huntington Park High Auditorium, 6020 Miles Ave., Huntington Park.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA091690-0090", "score": 7.502999782562256}, {"content": "Title: Content: CSO [\"Draft Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security\"] When the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources begin developing a draft \"Concept of Russian Federation Environmental Security\" in February 1992 it recruited the assistance of more than 50 scientists and specialists from the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and the science sections of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Russian Ministry of Health and other ministries.

Conditions Essential for the Implementation of Environmental Security Strategy * * * Introduction This Concept reflects the official views of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (Minprirody Rossii) on current principles, methods and mechanisms for environmental protection and efficient use of natural resources, which are an inalienable part of state policy with regard to our country's economic and social development. The current scale of environmental changes is creating a real threat to the public's life and health. The necessity of compensating for losses due to major accidents and natural disasters will require that economic resources be shifted away from performing strategic tasks in connection with the formation of a new economic structure toward fruitless attempts to maintain the economy in its current state. The greatest environmental threat is due to chemical factors, protection against which should be regarded as a priority objective. A faulty method of neutralizing emissions and discharges now predominates -- i.e. their dispersion and dilution to \"safe\" levels, levels that were established without consideration for the possibility of secondary concentration of eco-toxins at points in the environment, or their transformation into more toxic compounds. Particularly dangerous are the super-toxins, pollution by which is increasingly rapidly. There is a tremendous environmental threat from radioactive contamination, and one that is rapidly increasing in proportion to the accumulation of radioactive waste from spent atomic reactors from nuclear power plants, submarines, nuclear-powered surface ships, etc. There is a great danger of changes in the biological balance, particularly the correlation between pathogenic and saprophytic microorganisms and undesirable mutations in them. The speed with which the intensity of the adverse effects of external factors is increasing has surpassed limits on the speed of living systems' capability of biological adaptation to their environment. Destabilization of the environment is directly linked to a decline in public health. Russia ranks fifty-first in the world in terms of average life span, and its infant mortality rate is high. If these negative trends are not halted, then by the middle of the 21st century scarcity of food, water and oxygen, coupled with the genetic burden, will significantly accelerate the degeneration of populations and their gradual extinction. The basis for the creation of an environmental security policy is the creation of an adequate organizational, legal and sociopolitical economic mechanism for the management of natural resource use that is based on modern quantitative data regarding the possibility of counteracting anthropogenic and naturally-occurring biosphere destruction. In order to solve these urgent problems it is essential to formulate a general Concept of Russian Environmental Security and develop a methodology for its implementation. 1. General Principles 1.1. Fundamental Concepts and Definitions The environmental threat is the probability of destruction of the human habitat and the plants and animals connected with it as a result of uncontrolled economic development, outdated technologies and anthropogenic accidents and disasters which result in disruption of living systems' adaptation to the conditions under which they exist. Environmental security is the process of providing protection for the vitally important interests of the individual, society, nature and the state against actual or potential threats created by human or natural influence on the environment. An environmental security system is the aggregate of legislative, technical, medical and biological measures aimed at supporting the balance between the biosphere and both anthropogenic and natural external burdens. The subjects of environmental security are the individual, society, the biosphere and the state. The objects of environmental security are the vitally important interests of the subjects of security -- rights, the individual's physical and intellectual needs, natural resources and the natural environment -- as the physical foundation of state and social development. An environmental security policy is purposeful action by the state, public organizations and legal and physical persons to ensure environmental security. Environmental risk is the probability of unfavorable effects on the environment as the results of any anthropogenic changes in natural sites or factors. Maximum permissible environmental burden is the maximum level of effects by anthropogenic factors at which the functional integrity of ecosystems is maintained. An environmental emergency zone is a section of territory where as a result of commercial or other activities there occur persistent negative changes in the environment, resulting in disruption of public health or disruption of the balance among natural ecosystems, in particular damage to the genetic stock of plants and animals. An environmental disaster area is a section of territory where as a result of commercial or other activities and/or natural disasters irreversible changes have occurred in the environment, resulting in a rise in the rate of diseases and mortality among the population and destruction of biocenoses. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not simply the absence of the incidence of disease or disability (World Health Organization). 1.2. Specific Economic and Social Features of Russia's Development From the standpoint of environmental security one must delineate the following specific economic and social features of Russia's development: -- extensive development of the economy coupled with single-purpose use of natural resources, huge volumes of raw materials extraction and sales, the absence of a system for processing household and industrial wastes, and development of new agricultural land and abandonment of previous agricultural areas; -- a distorted economic structure with a prevalence of natural resource-intensive types of production that create a constant and excessive overload on ecosystems; -- a militarized economy; -- unreliable technical systems and inadequate training of personnel at enterprises with heightened environmental risk; -- outdated and ineffective environmental protection equipment at the final stages of technological processes; -- biological hazard -- danger to human beings, produce and natural ecosystems as a result of activity by living organisms; -- increasing urban population and an increasing supply of goods and services in the state-owned and private sectors of the economy, resulting in greater consumption of natural resources; -- natural and anthropogenic accidents, disasters and catastrophes; -- transportation-related effects; -- a distorted system for assessing environmental benefit and environmental losses, resulting in unprofitable natural resource use; -- a lack of institutions and experience with environmental regulation of commercial activities; -- a lack of a well-designed national system for environmental education and training and cultivation of an environmental world view; -- a lack of unity in the state's administration of environmental security. 1.3. Laws, Principles and Regulations Pertaining to Biosphere Function Laws \"Internal dynamic balance\": the matter, energy, information and quality of individual natural systems and their hierarchy are interconnected to such an extent that any change in one of those indices causes accompanying functional-structural qualitative and quantitative changes, maintaining the total amount of matter and energy and the informational and dynamic qualities of systems and their hierarchies. \"All or nothing\" (Kh. Boumech [sp?]): weak influences may not cause reciprocal reactions in natural systems until such time as they accumulate and result in the development of a turbulent, dynamic process. \"The minimum\" (Yu. Libikh): opportunities for life are delimited by environmental factors, the number and quality of which is close to the required minimum for an organism or an ecosystem, and further reduction thereof will result in the death of the organism or destruction of the ecosystem. \"Evolutionary and environmental irreversibility\": an ecosystem that has lost part of its elements cannot return to its original state. \"The irreplaceability of the biosphere\" (V. G. Gorshkov): reduction of the natural biota in an amount exceeding a threshold level deprives the environment of stability that cannot be restored through the use of treatment facilities or a transition to no-waste production. Principles The Le Shatelier-Braun Principle: in the event of an external influence that brings a system out of stable balance, the balance shifts in the direction in which the external influence becomes weaker. Remoteness of events: a phenomenon that is distant in time or space appears less significant. In the field of natural resource use this principle is especially frequently the basis for incorrect practical measures. Sudden intensification of pathogenicity: unexpected intensification of pathogenicity occurs upon mutation of a disease-producing organism, upon introduction of a new disease-producing organism into an ecosystem which has no mechanisms to regulate its numbers, or upon a very sharp change in the ecosystem's environment. Reasonable sufficiency and acceptability of risk: expansion of any human activities should not result in socioeconomic or environmental disasters. Rules Mutual adaptation (K. Mebius and G. F. Morozov): species in a biocenosis are adapted to each other to such an extent that their community constitutes an internally contradictory yet unified and interconnected systemic whole. Integral resource: competition between economic sectors with regard to the use of specific natural systems is inevitable, and they harm each other more in proportion to how significantly they change their jointly exploited environmental component or the entire ecosystem. Measures of natural system transformation: in the course of utilizing natural systems there are certain bounds that must not be overstepped if those systems are to maintain their self-supporting capacity (self-organization and self-regulation). Correspondence between environmental conditions and an organism's genetic predisposition: a species of an organism can exist only so long as the natural environment surrounding it is in line with that species' genetic adaptation capacity relative to the environment's variations and changes. Chain reactions from \"strict\" management of nature: \"strict\" and, as a rule, technical management of natural processes is fraught with the possibility of chain reactions, a significant portion of which will prove environmentally, socially and economically unacceptable. 1.4. Fundamental Principles of Ensuring Environmental Security The fundamental principles of ensuring environmental security consist of the following: -- social and economic development of society in the course of which people are ensured an improving quality of life coupled with a reduction in or stabilization of negative effects on the natural environment, and in which the laws of development for the biosphere and natural climate zones are observed; -- compliance with permissible levels of effects on the natural environment and on human beings as established by the state and the components of the Federation; -- non-depleting natural resource use in which the resource supply satisfies the interests of current and future generations equally; -- the obligation to compensate for damage done to the health of human beings and nature, and mutual responsibility of territorial administrative units for the state of the environment and cross-border transfer of pollutants; -- timely identification and restoration of disrupted territories (or bodies of water), ecosystems and natural complexes; -- preservation of biological diversity; -- the applicability of international law and compliance with bilateral and multilateral treaties regulating natural resource use and quality of life. 1.5. Goals of the Concept of Environmental Security The goals of this Concept are: -- development of conceptual foundations for an overall strategy in the field of environmental protection and efficient use of natural resources for the purpose of our country's sustainable economic and social development; -- definition of achievable mid-range and long-range goals and tasks in the field of environmental protection; -- definition of the structure and tasks of and mutual relations between components of the system for Russia's ensuring environmental security; -- identification of specific goals and tasks involved in the planning of policy and programs that must be adopted and carried out by the Government and regional administrative bodies. 2. Environmental Problems and Trends The current state of the environment attests to the fact that environmental problems are due to two basic factors: wasteful natural resource use, which reduces the biosphere's productivity, and pollution, which threatens all living things and in particular human health and well-being. It would be appropriate to consider critical environmental problems within the framework of the following sections: the atmosphere, inland surface and underground waters and seas, soil protection and land use, forests, wilderness and genetic resources, wastes and toxic chemicals, social factors, energy, industry and transportation. 2.1. The Atmosphere The principle pollutants in the air and precipitation are sulfur oxides, nitrogen, carbon, airborne organic substances, suspended particles, bonded heavy metals and organic compounds. These all have an adverse cumulative effect on human health, animals and plants. Also alarming are pollutants such as chlorofluorocarbons, halogens, and nitrogen and carbon oxides, which alter the distribution and concentration of ozone, affect the thermal balance and change climate. Environmental problems connected with the cross-border transfer of atmospheric pollutants over great distances are acute. 2.2. Inland Waters and Seas The priority environmental problems in the field of water protection are: -- diversion of water from a number of river basins and underground sources in excess of environmentally permissible levels; -- depletion of small rivers; -- large water losses as a result of water system disrepair and imperfect technological processes; -- discharge of polluted waste water into bodies of water; -- cross-border water pollution. The greatest contribution to surface water pollution comes from enterprises in the ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemical, petrochemical, oil, gas, coal, timber and paper industries, as well as agricultural enterprises and municipal services enterprises. Russia's sea basins are beings polluted by petroleum products, phenols, copper, zinc and chrome compounds and chloro-organic pesticides, with a trend toward increasing levels of pollution. 2.3. Soil Protection and Land Use The following types of pollution and soil degradation are most widespread in various regions: -- planar and channel erosion; -- gully erosion; -- accumulation or depletion of specific chemical elements; -- rise or fall in underground water level; -- salination; -- solonetzization; -- loss of organic substances and humus; -- loss of nutritive elements and increasing soil acidity; -- accumulation of toxic substances; etc. Large-scale use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides has resulted in contamination of surface waters and alteration of aquatic ecosystems. As a result of erosion processes, the spread of excessively wet, salinated or swampy land, and overgrowth by forests and shrubs there has been a decrease in the extent of arable land. Soils for a distance of several tens of kilometers around cities and industrial centers are contaminated by petroleum products, heavy metals and toxic organic substances. Large sections of land have been removed from agricultural use by development of oil, gas and coal fields, iron ore deposits and other minerals. The mining industry is one of the largest sources of environmental degradation and pollution. 2.4. Forests Degradation of forests results from gaseous air pollutants, precipitation of acidic components and heavy metals, changes in climatic conditions, etc. As a result of intensive commercial activity and losses due to forest fires, stands of mature timber are declining in evergreen forests in the European part of Russia. Forests are protected against fires on just 65 percent of Russia's total forest area. Deforestation creates environmental problems such as rapid sedimentation of bodies of water, soil erosion, reduction in water supply, etc. 2.5. Biological Diversity The present state of the environment permits one to define the principal negative phenomena in the environmental life cycle as: -- decreasing biological diversity; -- smaller populations of a number of species; -- accelerated aging of populations; -- disappearance of individual species from biocenoses; -- impoverishment of flora and fauna, particularly in areas with a high concentration of industry and population. 2.6. Wastes Russia currently has more than 50 billion metric tons of wastes stored on an area of 250,000 hectares. A significant portion of this waste is classified as toxic substances of industrial origin. Russia lacks appropriate environmental standards for enterprises with regard to the neutralization and storage of toxic industrial waste. Approximately four billion curies of radioactive waste have accumulated in special containers, uncovered pools, other bodies of water and near-surface burial sites. Each year more than 130 million metric tons of solid household waste is created and transported to dumps and landfills. Industrial and household wastes place a major burden on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and present a serious threat to the health of human beings and the environment. 2.7. Energy, Industry and Transportation Approximately 25 percent of all substances that pollute the air in Russia enter the environment as a result of the combustion of fuel in power-producing, heating and industrial boilers. The degree of environmental pollution in areas where heavy industry is concentrated is horrifying. Motor vehicle exhaust fumes pollute the air with hydrocarbons, lead and oxides of sulfur, nitrogen and carbon, and also contribute to acid rain. 2.8. Social Factors The social environment may be envisioned as being comprised of subsystems such as demography, economics, education, social structure and culture, as well as dependent factors -- stresses on human beings. In this period of economic transition to a market economy the following events have become critical: -- loss of our country's intellectual potential due to emigration by scientists and specialists; -- changes in nutrition; -- a decline in the birthrate; -- lack of access to medical care among certain segments of the population; -- vocational reorientation; -- inaccessibility of recreational sites due to their high cost; -- a state of heightened personal and social stress. 3. A System of Long-Range Goals The following may be defined as strategic goals: -- creation of an environment favorable to human health; -- assurance of rational, non-depleting natural resource use, biosphere balance, preservation of the genetic stock as well as species and landscape diversity, and balance between the processes of reproduction and utilization of renewable natural resources. 3.1.

Long-Range Goals Development and implementation of a national program to bring about resource conservation through comprehensive utilization of raw materials, thorough processing of industrial and consumer wastes, and replacement of current technologies with ones that conserve resources Guarantees of a dynamic balance between environmental quality, efficient use of natural resources and our country's sustainable socioeconomic development Development of environmental requirements, standards and indices; a marked reduction in emissions of sulfur, nitrogen and carbon oxides and various other specific pollutants from all sources, with consideration for critical ecosystem burdens as defined at the international level Reduction of atmospheric emissions which result in depletion of the ozone layer and affect the thermal balance Preservation of biological and genetic resources and species and landscape diversity Preservation and improvement of the quality of surface and underground water, and prevention of pollution of seas and the coastal marine environment Realization of environmentally-based natural resource utilization Correlation of the national environmental security system with international standards and regulations in the field of environmental protection and efficient natural resource use Guarantees of an environmentally-based quality of human life 4. The Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) 4.1. Goals and Tasks The components required for compliance with environmental security requirements are guarantees of chemical, radiation, biological and industrial safety throughout Russia. Involved in the implementation of measures designed to achieve, maintain and monitor compliance with environmental security requirements are various Russia ministries, agencies, institutions and organizations. A real effect from such measures can be achieved only if they are applied in a comprehensive manner, which in turn will require the application of a clearly-defined mechanism for organizational management of all participants in this process. A Russian Environmental Security System (RosSEB) [Rossiyskaya sistema ekologicheskoy bezopasnosti) will have to be established to provide that mechanism. RosSEB's principal tasks will be: -- organizational management of the process of achieving target indices of environmental security throughout all of Russia and in its individual territorial administrative units; -- organization and implementation of monitoring of compliance with environmental security requirements; -- interaction with other state systems working to support the life of society and the public, in particular with the Russian Council on Emergency Situations; -- prevention and elimination of the environmental effects of industrial and natural accidents and disasters; -- prevention of the emergence of environmental problem and disaster zones or environmental emergencies, as well as participation in the organization of efforts to eliminate their effects when they do emerge; -- assessment of the state of environmental security in Russia, and projection of its dynamics; -- provision of a unified state policy that will formulate guarantees for the reliable existence and sustainable development of the objects of environmental security; -- planning and coordination of compliance with comprehensive programs for environmental protection and efficient natural resource use; -- creation, development and equipping of personnel and means for ensuring environmental security in Russia; -- coordination of international agreements on ways to ensure Russia's environmental security. 4.2. RosSEB Structure RosSEB will consist of macrosystem administrative bodies, personnel and equipment which will support systems and perform the tasks assigned to RosSEB, as well as means of information support for the decision-making process. All these elements of the macrosystem should be interconnected in a single system for information transfer and command-and-administrative actions. Establishment of the RosSEB should occur on principles of organizational unification of the individual functional elements and structures which currently exist within ministries and agencies for the purpose of resolving individual environmental security issues. The principal organizational support mechanisms should be: -- directed state programs in the field of environmental security; -- unified environmental security requirements; -- unified targeted indices of environmental security and unified regulations and procedures for achieving them; -- unified state monitoring of compliance with environmental security requirements and compliance with target indices; -- information interaction in support of organizational management. Performance of these functions should be assigned to the state administrative agency that is responsible for implementation of policy in the field of environmental security, i.e. the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (see chart). The functional subsystems of environmental security administration include: -- a subsystem for regional administration of environmental security; -- a subsystem for administration of the environmental security of potentially hazardous sites; -- a subsystem for management of industrially-produced and other environmentally hazardous and toxic wastes; -- a subsystem for nuclear and radiation security; -- a subsystem for recovery from the effects of environmental emergencies; -- a subsystem for management of environmental security in connection with military activities (with the exception of a special period); -- a subsystem for management of the state of public health; -- a state monitoring system (environmental monitoring, industrial monitoring, etc.). The state monitoring system: environmental monitoring (EGSM [Unified State Monitoring System], EGASKRO [expansion unclear]); medical and biological monitoring (the AIS \"Zdorovye\" [Health Analysis and Information System], etc.); monitoring of industrial, energy-related and transportation facilities; monitoring of nuclear power facilities; monitoring of potentially hazardous sites; monitoring of sites where hazardous chemical, radioactive or biological wastes and substances are stored or buried; monitoring of production- and consumption-related wastes; monitoring of shipments of hazardous substances and materials; monitoring of hazardous natural phenomena; Monitoring of global natural phenomena and processes; monitoring of agricultural production; monitoring of soils and land. The federal information and analysis system: the information and analysis system (IAS) for environmental security under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources; territorial (regional) information and analysis systems under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources; the Russian Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight [Gosgortekhnadzor] IAS; the Russian Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety [Gosatomnadzor] IAS; the Russian State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Gossanepidnadzor] and Ministry of Health IAS; the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control [Rosgidromet] IAS. The Environmental Security Automated Information and Control System [AIUS \"Ekologicheskaya bezopasnost\"]: a consultation and administration system under the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources (the Ministry's central apparatus); a consultation and administration system under regional agencies of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection (the Ministry's regional committees); administrative systems under the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations, Federal Mining and Industrial Oversight, Federal Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, the Russian Ministry of Health, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control. The means of achieving environmental security are: a normative legal foundation; environmental programs; state environmental monitoring; licensing of activities; environmental impact assessment; regulations and standards; environmental education and training; international cooperation. The personnel that will ensure environmental security are: subordinate divisions of environmental assessment and inspection agencies; Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection emergency environmental aid personnel; subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Russian Ministry of Security; subordinate divisions of the Russian State Committee for Emergency Situations, including Civil Defense units; medical services; services for the protection of plant and animal life; subordinate divisions of the Russian Ministry of Transportation, the Russian Ministry of Railways, and other specialized units and divisions which carry out measures and actions to protect the public and the natural environment. The objects of administration are the ministries and agencies which carry out state administration of environmentally harmful and hazardous types of activities, in particular the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of Fuel and Energy, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Agriculture and State Committee for Architecture and Construction. 5. The Mechanism for Ensuring Russia's Environmental Security The mechanisms for achieving this goal are: -- a legislative and normative legal basis for activities in the field of environmental security; -- an organizational basis for administration of efforts with regard to ensuring environmental security; -- economic mechanisms; -- a technological basis for environmentally safe development of industry, energy production and transportation; -- state monitoring of activities by ministries and agencies in the field of compliance with environmental security requirements as they go about implementing Russia's state environmental policy; -- use of scientific-technical and production potential in the defense sectors of industry. 6. Conditions Essential for the Implementation of Environmental Security Strategy Environmental security must become an inseparable part of efforts by the state and its organs in the field of ensuring the overall security of society and the state. Environmental protection efforts must become one of the most important functions of the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Environmental protection is based on integration of environmental, economic and social policy. Economic development is based on development of low-waste and no-waste technologies and minimizing of the social and environmental cost of economic activity. There must be active participation in compliance with international conventions on the environment. Current and pending Russian Federation legislation regarding environmental protection and the rational use of natural resources as well as the Statute on the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources are to be based on this Concept. Materials from annual Russian Federation state reports on the state of the environment, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and materials from the International Labor Organization, UNESCO, the European Economic Community and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were used in the preparation of this Concept. Individual environmental security concepts submitted to the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources by scientists from various institutions were also analyzed.

A radioactive gauge is missing from a cement manufacturing plant near Gorman that is already under fire from environmentalists because it burns hazardous waste, and a two-week search has failed to find any trace of the gauge, company and state officials said Thursday. The National Cement Co. plant in Lebec is being investigated by state health officials, who said they expect to cite the company for mishandling the device. State and federal officials said the amount of radioactive material contained in the device is so small that it does not pose a public health hazard. The radioactive material was sealed inside a container that would prevent harmful exposure. And even if the material were somehow released, the level of radiation would not be strong enough to harm anyone nearby, said Greg Cook, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The missing gauge is just the latest in a series of problems for the cement plant, the only one in California permitted to burn hazardous wastes as fuel. Earlier this month, state health officials fined its operators $350,000 for burning too much waste in 1988 and 1989. In the latest incident, plant workers and a state health inspector dug up areas of the nearby Lebec Landfill in Kern County on Monday thinking the gauge might have been accidentally thrown out, said Donald Bunn, an official with the state Department of Health Services. Bunn, who is in charge of compliance for the state's radiologic health office, said the company will be cited for this incident and could face sanctions on its operating license or other legal action. The company reported the device missing on March 9. Plant Manager Byron McMichael said it had been removed from one building sometime earlier and was taken to a shop on the plant site to await reinstallation elsewhere. \"We went to install it and we couldn't find it,\" McMichael said. Bunn said he believed the company was not authorized to remove the device and should not have left it in a shop. The company and a state health inspector searched the plant without success. Although the search has been suspended, the company is still questioning its employees about what might have become of the device, McMichael said. The device is described as a lead pipe about a foot long, containing 20 millicuries of the radioactive material cesium-137. It was one of 19 sensors used at the plant that contains varying amounts of radioactive material. Such sensors are fairly common in industrial manufacturing uses, state officials said. Even if the shielding were removed, a person would have to be closely exposed to the material for more than 83 hours to exceed the NRC's established annual exposure threshold for an individual, the NRC's Cook estimated. However, state and federal officials also said their policy is to keep radioactive material out of the environment. Thus, a Gardena business that unknowingly melted what state officials believe may have been a similar device had to be temporarily closed and decontaminated last spring, Bunn said. The news that the plant had radioactive materials on site came as a surprise to local environmentalists. They said the loss of the gauge illustrates the unreliability of the plant's operations. \"It just goes to show they can't be trusted with what they're doing,\" said Helen Thornburg, who is a leader of a local environmental group that has repeatedly protested that the burning of hazardous wastes endangers the health of area residents.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA032390-0007", "score": 7.466599941253662}, {"content": "Title: Content: \u2022Cleaning up spills or leaks in bulk containment areas to prevent contamination of storm or wash wasters. Equipment promoting waste minimization by reducing or eliminating waste generation include: \u2022Low-volume/high-pressure hoses for cleaning; \u2022Drum triple-rinsing stations; \u2022Reactor scrubber systems designed to return captured reactants to the next batch rather than to disposal; \u2022Material storage tanks with inert liners to prevent contamination of water blankets with contaminants which would prohibit its use in the process; and \u2022Enclosed automated product handling equipment to eliminate manual product packaging. Waste minimization measures can be tailored to the needs of individual industries, processes, and firms. This approach may make it possible to achieve greater pollution reduction with less cost and disruption to the firm. Defined process control and good housekeeping practices often can result in significant waste volume or toxicity reduction. Evaluations of existing processes also may point out the need for more complex engineering approaches ( e.g. , waste reuse, secondary processing of distillation bottoms, and use of vacuum pumps instead of steam jets) to achieve waste minimization objectives. Simple physical audits of current waste generation and in-plant management practices for the wastes also can yield positive results. These audits often turn up simple non-engineering practices that can be implemented successfully. B. Waste Minimization Approaches in the Listing Program Section 1003 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 says that one of RCRA's goals is to promote protection of human health and the environment and to conserve valuable material and energy resources by ``minimizing the generation of hazardous waste and the land disposal of hazardous waste by encouraging process substitution, materials recovery, properly conducted recycling, and reuse and treatment.'' Section 1003 further provides that it is a national policy of the United States that, whenever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible. To further EPA's waste minimization goals, the Waste Minimization Branch (WMB) in EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) established the RCRA Waste Minimization Action Plan to integrate source reduction and recycling into the National RCRA Program, and RCRA activities into the Agency's Pollution Prevention Strategy. As described in that plan, EPA's program for evaluating which wastes should be listed as hazardous is an example of a regulatory program that can provide opportunities for encouraging and promoting real waste minimization. When a wastestream is listed as hazardous, it enters the hazardous waste management system. The requirements of that system can be costly and there are currently only limited ways for a waste entering the system to get out. Once it is listed as a hazardous waste, it remains a listed hazardous waste even after treatment and safe disposal, unless delisted pursuant to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22. Other than levels at which wastes typically are delisted, there is no target for a generator to shoot for which would allow their waste to be considered non-hazardous even if waste minimization actions are taken that ensure the waste is not likely to pose a hazard to human health and the environment. However, if a waste minimization-based exemption to the listing could be provided, generators would have the regulatory and economic incentive to meet the exemption. When the exemption is tailored to encourage and reward waste minimization efforts, then the generator could obtain the benefit of not generating a listed hazardous waste while furthering national waste minimization goals. The Agency notes that there are several important considerations in developing listing determinations that encourage waste minimization. First, waste minimization-based listings must promote actual waste minimization and clearly not increase risk. In addition, the listings must be enforceable. 1. Actual Waste Minimization Must Occur. The Agency is interested in taking comment on developing listings that encourage reductions in volumes, reductions in concentrations of constituents of concern (without diluting constituents in an effort to reduce concentration), reductions in environmental loading of constituents of concern, and/or the removal of constituents of concern (or process derivatives of concern) from the manufacturing process, and/or the beneficial reuse, recycling, or reclamation of the wastestreams themselves, provided human health and the environment is protected. A waste minimization-based listing, for example, must be crafted so as not to result simply in cross-media transfer, and so as not to leave uncontrolled wastes reduced in volume or concentration, but still posing a significant hazard. The Agency believes that generators must make a commitment that waste minimization in fact would occur, and that a real investment in waste minimization techniques, equipment, and process changes would be carried out. 2. No Increase in Risk Can Occur. A waste minimization-based listing (or variable level) must protect human health and the environment and not increase risk. A hazardous waste listing achieves the goal of minimizing risk by placing a wastestream in the hazardous waste management system. Any exemption which takes a wastestream out of this system must be shown to provide an equivalent decrease in risk as that provided by the listing itself. It would be unacceptable, for example, for waste minimization actions simply to result in cross-media transfer of wastes. Chemical substitution that fails to reduce the risks posed by a wastestream is another example of a practice that would not be considered to be waste minimization. Another specific concern involves the possible presence of other constituents in a wastestream for which the waste was not specifically listed but which also may pose risk to human health or the environment. A waste minimization-based listing must consider the impact of letting the entire wastestream out of the hazardous waste management system. 3. Enforceability. The Agency is particularly concerned about the enforceability of waste minimization-based variance to a listing. In particular, the Agency has concerns about the following factors: \u2022The amount of testing or monitoring required, \u2022Ease by which a State inspector could check compliance, \u2022How a generator would demonstrate compliance with the waste minimization-based exemption, \u2022The likelihood that a State agency would adopt a waste minimization approach in its listing regulations, and \u2022The ability of a State agency to oversee an exemption. Any waste minimization-based listing must account for these concerns.

Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. Summary The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. If this wastestream were managed by disposal in a municipal landfill (the plausible management scenario used for other wastewater treatment sludges), it would meet the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. However, as discussed in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency has determined that management in a municipal landfill is not plausible for this wastestream. Despite this determination, for comparison purposes the Agency calculated the risks associated with disposal in a municipal landfill and with diposal in an on-site boiler. If, based on comments, the Agency determines that it is not reasonable to use fuel blending as the plausible management scenario, the Agency probably would determine that plausible management is disposal in a municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway, and is disposal in an on-site boiler for the air pathway. Disposal in an on-site monofill, which was established as the plausible management scenario for other wastewater treatment sludges ( i.e. , K162 and K164), is not a practical option for this wastestream due to its low volume relative to the capacity of a monofill, and so is not feasible economically. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water due to releases from a municipal landfill, EPA calculated high-end individual cancer-risk levels of 1E&hyph;4 and 8E&hyph;5 for the constituents benzidine and aniline, respectively. The coeluting compounds 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene are calculated to pose risks between 1E&hyph;6 and 1E&hyph;5. Therefore, the combined carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this wastestream would be 2E&hyph;4, assuming disposal in a landfill. However, the risks associated with the current and plausible management practice, blending with non-hazardous fuel, are insignificant for any constituent. Thus, the Agency is proposing not to list it as hazardous. Discussion Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock currently is generated at only one facility. This waste is generated from a filter press that is used as part of the wastewater pretreatment system. The waste is generated at a rate of approximately 18 metric tons per year. EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this sludge in Table II&hyph;9. The data presented in this table represent one sample from one facility. Unlike earlier wastestreams, health benchmarks exist for all the contaminants detected in this wastestream (with the exception of one coeluting compound, which is discussed later in this section). Additional compounds which do have health benchmarks, however, have been identified in these wastes, but were dropped from further consideration following the risk screening. The complete list of compounds found in this and other wastestreams is presented in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see ADDRESSES section). Details on the risk assessment are provided in Section II.D of this preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see ADDRESSES section).", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00058", "score": 7.398399829864502}, {"content": "Title: Content: b.

AIR POLLUTANTS * Ozone: This colorless, irritant form of oxygen is the most pervasive air pollutant. At high altitudes, it protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, but it can be formed in excess when sunlight interacts with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry. Short-term effects of exposures include headaches, eye irritation, sore throat, coughing, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Chronic exposures to high levels of ozone appear to accelerate the aging process of the lung and people who live in highly polluted areas are likely to have a greater risk of developing chronic lung diseases. The effect is independent of the effects of tobacco smoking. Scientists have not been able to prove that chronic ozone exposure increases the risk of developing lung and other cancers. * Nitrogen oxides: Like ozone, nitrogen oxides are harmful lung irritants. They are produced when fossil fuels such as gasoline and oil are burned. The brown gas may increase susceptibility to bronchitis and other respiratory infections. * Particulates: These are microscopic liquid droplets or solids less than the width of a human hair that are suspended in the atmosphere. They include soil, metals, sulfates, nitrates and organic chemicals. The smallest particles, those less than 10 microns in diameter, or PM-10, are the greatest health hazard because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs. They may increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. The average Los Angeles Basin resident has a risk of death in any year of 1 in 10,000 greater than would be the case if federal PM-10 standards were met, according to a study prepared for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Riverside and San Bernardino County residents have risks that are about twice the basin average; Orange County residents are below the average. By contrast, the yearly risk of dying in a motor vehicle accident in California is two in 10,000. * Carbon monoxide: This colorless, odorless gas is produced by incomplete combustion of gasoline and other carbon-containing fuels. More than 90% of the carbon monoxide in the basin is emitted directly from motor vehicles. Carbon monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. Symptoms include headaches and breathing difficulties. Individuals with heart disease may have increased vulnerability to angina, a chest pain caused by oxygen deprivation of the heart, or irregular heart beats during exercise. * Sulfur compounds: Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with a sharp odor that is emitted by power plants, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. It can be converted to the more irritant sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain, and a variety of sulfur-containing particles. Exposures can cause asthmatic reactions as well as nose, throat and eye irritation. Sulfur compounds are one of the few significant pollutants that are not abundant in Southern California air. * Toxic chemicals. There are hundreds of cancer-causing chemicals in Southern California air, but only about 10, including benzene, chromium, and ethylene dibromide, are specifically regulated, according to Dr. John Froines, director of the UCLA Occupational Health Center. These compounds may be emitted through industrial combustion or when fuels, solvents and paints evaporate. Researchers lack good estimates of the number of cancers or birth defects that may be caused by air-borne toxics. DRINKING WATER Federal law requires that all water be disinfected to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. In general, when a drinking water source, such as a well, is found to contain excess pollutants, health guidelines are met by either closing the well or blending the well water with water from other cleaner supplies. But there may be health risks from the low concentrations of regulated chemicals that are permitted in drinking water, high concentrations of regulated chemicals that escape detection, and unregulated contaminants. * Nitrates: Nitrates are California's major ground water pollutant. They enter through nitrogen-based fertilizers, animal wastes, sewage spills and septic tanks. The maximum contaminant level is 45 parts per million. Nitrates are primarily a hazard to infants. Nitrite, a nitrate conversion product, can cause methemoglobinemia, or \"blue baby syndrome,\" a potentially fatal interference with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. * Organic chemicals: Surface water and ground water may be contaminated by hundreds of chemicals, including pesticides, such as dibromochloropropane (DBCP), and industrial solvents, such as trichloroethane, trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene. While the health effects of specific organic chemicals vary, the general concerns relate to cancer, birth defects, and, in the case of DBCP, sterility in highly exposed men. * Disinfection byproducts: These are formed when chemicals added to water to prevent infectious diseases react with organic materials that are present in the water. One example is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are produced when chlorine reacts with organic materials. \"Trihalomethanes in treated water represent a higher cancer risk than most toxic pollutants at the levels that the latter have been measured in drinking water,\" according to an article by California Department of Health Services officials. The maximum contaminant level of 100 parts per billion would be expected to cause 200 additional cancer cases in 1 million people over a 70-year lifetime. Public health officials justify this risk by pointing to the even greater benefits of preventing water-borne infectious diseases, caused by bacteria and other germs. OCEAN WATER The Southern California ocean has been contaminated by millions of gallons of pesticides, gasoline industrial wastes, storm drain runoff and untreated and partly treated sewage. These contaminants may pose health risks to swimmers, boaters and individuals who eat contaminated seafood. In general, many of these health risks can be minimized by following the recommendations of health officials. Do not, for example, swim near storm drain outfalls or at beaches that are closed because of sewage contamination or fish or collect mussels and other shellfish in known hazardous areas. * Swimming: When unapproved areas are avoided, state health officials say it is unlikely that ocean swimmers will contract bacterial diarrhea and other water-borne ailments. * Seafood consumption: The safety of seafood from Southern California coastal waters is variable, according to state health officials. Specific warnings have been issued for certain fish from certain areas. For example, white croaker from much of Santa Monica Bay may be contaminated by DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Health officials are only now in the process of analyzing recently collected fish samples from up and down the coast that may help to pinpoint the potential risk from other areas and for other fish. Until more data is available, a general guideline is to not eat the same fish caught in the same spot all the time. It is also prudent to cook mussels, oysters and other shellfish. SOIL POLLUTANTS Soil pollutants include pesticides, solvents, metals, acids, and petroleum wastes. These pollutants are most likely to be found near dumps that accept toxic wastes and near industrial sites. Thousands of sites have been identified in Southern California where industry and, in some cases, local governments have dumped or spilled hazardous materials that could represent some risk to the public health. Soil pollutants may pose a general health risk if they contaminate ground water supplies. In addition, extremely toxic pollutants may be produced when organic chemicals are burned.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA121089-0235", "score": 7.32919979095459}, {"content": "Title: Content: (s) Shucked shellfish means molluscan shellfish that have one or both shells removed.

The risks associated with disposing these wastewaters in surface impoundments would be very high. Two hazardous constituents (aniline and benzidine) are present in the waste at concentrations that would pose substantial risks to human health and the environment ( i.e. , greater than 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens) for treatment in a surface impoundment. Large quantities of aniline, used in excess, are used as a raw material in this process. As a result, very high concentrations of aniline are present in the process waters. Even after recovery operations, EPA found high concentrations of aniline (in this case, an average of 200 ppm) remaining in the wastewater effluent discharged to the POTW. Benzidine was found to be present in several wastestreams from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and is believed to be either a raw material contaminant or a reaction by-product. The risks posed by benzidine at the concentrations present in these wastewaters are 3E&hyph;4, using a surface impoundment management scenario. The coeluting constituents, 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, which are likely by-products arising from the oxidation of aniline are present in the waste at a concentration resulting in a calculated risk level of 1E&hyph;5, based on the toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (see Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, for a discussion on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for coeluting compounds). The mass spectrum representing these two coeluting compounds was identified in all three wastewater samples collected from triarylmethane pigment operations. However, based on the insignificant risks associated with the current and plausible management practice for this wastestream (treatment in tanks), EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production of TAM pigments as hazardous. Although this wastestream would be hazardous if used for spray irrigation or handled in surface impoundments, the Agency does not believe that such management is plausible. The facilities generating the wastewater already are 100% invested in treating the waste in tanks prior to sending it to a POTW. In addition, this is not a strongly expanding segment of the industry, so the Agency does not anticipate more facilities starting up similar operations. Further, there is a general bias under most State industrial waste programs against allowing surface impoundments to be built. Thus, based on the risk associated with treatment in tanks, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream as hazardous. c. Still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments (K166). Summary The Agency is proposing to list still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments as hazardous. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end individual risk levels (greater than 1E&hyph;4) for carcinogens under both the baseline and plausible management scenarios. Two carcinogens pose high-end risks exceeding 9E&hyph;3 for the plausible management scenario of disposal in an on-site monofill. These two constituents pose very high levels of risk (greater than 1E&hyph;3) for the baseline management practice of disposal in a municipal landfill. In addition, one of these constituents has an HQ of 6 for the air pathway associated with management in an on-site boiler, a practice which is both a baseline management practice and a plausible management scenario. Discussion This wastestream includes distillation bottoms from the production of triarylmethane dye and pigments, which are generated from solvent and raw material recovery operations ( i.e., recovery of aniline, dimethylaniline, or other solvents).", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00062", "score": 7.29040002822876}, {"content": "Title: Content: 2.1.3.5. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSC is an independent Federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over most consumer products. Most chemical hazards are regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) administered by CPSC. The FHSA requires appropriate cautionary labeling on all hazardous household products (hazards include chronic toxicity such as neurotoxicity). While the FHSA does not require premarket registration, a manufacturer is required to assess the hazards of a product prior to marketing and assure that it is labeled with all necessary cautionary information. The FHSA also bans children's products that are hazardous and provides the CPSC with the authority to ban other hazardous products. 2.1.3.6. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. ATSDR has a mission to prevent or mitigate adverse effects to both human health and the quality of life resulting from exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. The ATSDR publishes a National Priority List (NPL) of hazardous substances that are found at National Priority Waste Sites. The order of priority is based on an algorithm, taking into consideration frequency with which substances are found at NPL sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure; this list is reranked on a yearly basis. So far, 129 toxicological profiles have been developed for the priority hazardous substances, and 92 substances have a profile with a neurological health effect endpoint (HAZDAT, 1992). Neurotoxicity has been selected by the ATSDR to be one of the seven high-priority health conditions resulting from exposure to environmental toxicants. 2.2. Basic Toxicological Considerations for Neurotoxicity 2.2.1. Basic Toxicological Principles A chemical must enter the body, reach the tissue target site(s), and be maintained at a sufficient concentration for a period of time in order for an adverse effect to occur. Not all chemicals have the same level of toxicity; some may be very toxic in small amounts while others may have little effect even at extremely high amounts. Thus, the dose-response relationship is a major concept in determining the toxicity of a specific substance. Other factors in determining toxicity include the physical and chemical properties of the substance, the route and level of exposure, the susceptibility of the target tissue, and the health, gender, and age of the exposed individual. Once the toxic substance has entered the body, usually through the lungs (inhalation), the skin (absorption), or the gastrointestinal tract (ingestion), it is partitioned into various body tissues where it can act on its target sites. The substance is eliminated from the bloodstream by the process of accumulation into the various sites in the body, with the liver and kidney being major sites of accumulation of toxic substances. This is thought to be associated with these organs' large blood capacity and major role in elimination of substances from the body. Lipophilic chemicals accumulate in lipid-rich areas of the body and present a significant potential problem for the nervous system. The nervous system is unique in its high percentage content of lipid (50 percent of dry weight) and may be particularly vulnerable to such chemicals. The site or sites of accumulation for a specific toxic substance may or may not be the primary sites of action. Examples include two known neurotoxicants, carbon monoxide in the red blood cells and lead in the bone. It must be noted that some substances are not distributed throughout the body, partially as a function of their insolubility, polarity, or molecular weight. The effect that a substance has will generally depend on the body burden or level in the tissue and duration of exposure. The time course of the levels is determined by several factors, including the amount at time of exposure, duration of exposure, and metabolic fate of the chemical. The study of such metabolic processes, pharmacokinetics, has demonstrated complex patterns in the absorption, distribution, possible biotransformation, and elimination of various substances (Klaassen, 1980). Many substances are removed by the kidney and excreted through the urine. The liver can detoxify substances like organic lead, which are excreted from the liver into the bile and then the small intestines, bypassing the blood and kidney. Lipophilic toxic substances are primarily removed from the body through feces and bile, and water-soluble metabolites are removed in the urine, through the skin, and through expiration into the air. Biotransformation is a biochemical process that converts a substance into a different chemical compound, allowing it to be excreted more easily. Substances are more easily removed if they are biotransformed into a more hydrophilic compound. Biotransformation can either aid in the detoxification of a substance or produce a more toxic metabolite. Therefore, the original substance may not be the substance that is producing the toxicity on the nervous system or any other system. Thus, several factors must be taken into consideration when evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of a chemical. They include the pharmacokinetics of the parent compound, the target tissue concentrations of the parent chemical or its bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or metabolite into the cell and/or membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical or metabolite with presumed receptor sites. 2.2.2. Basic Neurotoxicological Principles Neurotoxicity can be manifest as a structural or functional adverse response of the nervous system to a chemical, biological, or physical agent (Tilson, 1990b). It is a function of both the property of the agent and a property of the nervous system itself. Neurotoxicity refers broadly to the adverse neural responses following exposure to chemical or physical agents (e.g., radiation) (Tilson, 1990b). Adverse effects include any change that diminishes the ability to survive, reproduce, or adapt to the environment. Neuroactive substances may also impair health indirectly by altering behavior in such a way that safety is decreased in the performance of numerous activities. Toxicity can occur at any time in the life cycle, from conception through senescence, and its manifestations can change with age. The range of responses can vary from temporary responses following acute exposures to delayed responses following acute or chronic exposure to persistent responses. Neurotoxicity may or may not be reversible following cessation of exposure. The responses may be graded from transient to fatal and there may be different responses to the same neurotoxicant at different dose levels but similar responses to exposure to different agents. Displays of a neurotoxic response may be progressive in nature, with small deficits occurring early in exposure and developing to become more severe over time. Expression of neurotoxicity can encompass multiple levels of organization and complexity including structural, biochemical, physiological, and behavioral measurements.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940817-2-00223", "score": 7.245200157165527}, {"content": "Title: Content: (3) Alternative Non-regulatory Options Based on the above evidence, OSHA has concluded that the private market has failed to provide optimal levels of safety to employees. Consequently, some form of intervention that fosters safer work environments must be used to reduce occupational exposure. Because such intervention need not occur through government regulation, OSHA has considered the effectiveness of other non-regulatory options: (1) relying on tort litigation and (2) relying on workers' compensation programs. (a) Tort Liability. The use of liability under tort law is one nonregulatory alternative that has been increasingly used in litigation concerning occupationally related illnesses. Prosser [Ex. 4&hyph;256] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong, other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages''. If the tort system applies, it would allow a worker whose health has been adversely affected by occupational exposure to a hazardous substance to sue and recover damages from the employer. Thus, if the tort system is effectively applied, it might shift the liability of direct costs of occupational disease from the worker to the firm under certain specific circumstances. With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viable alternative in dealings between employees and employers. All states have legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusive or principal remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus, under tort law, workers with an occupational disease caused by exposure to a hazardous substance can only file a product liability suit against a third party manufacturer, processor, distributor, sales firm, or contractor. It is often difficult, however, to demonstrate a direct link between an exposure to a hazardous substance and the illness. In order to pursue litigation successfully, there must be specific knowledge of the magnitude and duration of a worker's exposure to a hazardous substance, as well as the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure. Usually, it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupational exposures in causing the disease, especially if workers are exposed to many toxic substances and the exposure is not necessarily limited to the workplace such as the case for ETS. This difficulty is further compounded by the long latency periods that are frequently involved. In addition, the liable party must be identifiable, but workers may have several employers over a working lifetime. The burden of proof that an occupational exposure to a hazardous substance occurred, that a specific employer is the liable party, and that the exposure level was significant may prohibit the individual from initiating the suit. There are an increasing number of lawsuits that are related to health effects to building occupants from poor indoor air quality. These lawsuits are typically filed after the illness or health effect has been diagnosed. In this sense, increasing pressure is being placed on businesses. However, the legal pressure currently does not relate to the implementation of a clean indoor air policy (e.g., legal action is not currently being taken just because a company does not have a clean indoor air policy. These actions are event related as opposed to being policy related). IAQ litigation is growing rapidly and the focus is shifting from residential to commercial facilities. Examples to emphasize that are the recent $12.5 million claims against the Social Security Administration for the Richmond, California episode of Legionnaire's disease, the Call versus Prudential case in which building tenants settled with the defendants in what may have been the first jury trial in sick building litigation, and a suit by Hamilton, Ohio, county employees against their office building owners alleging exposure to fumes, bacteria, fungi, dust and irritants [Ex. 3&hyph;575]. Legal proceedings do not internalize occupational illness costs because they involve substantial legal fees associated with bringing about court action. In deciding whether to sue, the tort victim must be sure that the size of the claim will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, the plaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction costs in the form of a contingency fee, commonly 33 percent, plus additional legal expenses. The accused firm must also pay for its defense. The high costs and uncertainties associated with tort law make it an inefficient mechanism for ensuring adequate protection of workers' health. Insurance and liability costs are not borne in full by the specific employer responsible for the risk involved. For firms that are insured, the premium determination process is such that premiums only partially reflect changes in risk associated with changes in exposure to hazardous substances. This lack of complete adjustment is the so-called ``moral hazard'' problem, which is the risk that arises from the possible imprudence of the insured. As the insured firm has paid an insurance company to assume some of the risks, that firm has less reason to exercise the diligence necessary to avoid losses. Transfer of risk is a fundamental source of imperfection in markets. There is a growing number of state and local laws and ordinances controlling smoking. Armed with new data that show health effects from indoor air pollutants, plaintiffs who believe that they have been injured by the air inside their workplaces are beginning to take the offensive. They are lobbying on the local, state and federal levels for protective legislation, and in the absence of such legislation, they are suing for damages to their health. These cases are complex not only in the nature of the technical proof that must be developed and presented, but also in the number of parties involved. Suits have been filed against architects, builders, contractors, building product manufacturers and realtors [Ex. 3&hyph;662].", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940405-1-00097", "score": 7.236000061035156}, {"content": "Title: Content: FR940223-2-00104 a.

If report cards were handed out to California's 1,028 school districts and private schools, grading them on asbestos abatement awareness and compliance with the 1986 Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act, very few would score a a passing mark, according to a number of experts in the field. What surfaces from an overview of the asbestos problem in schools is a hodgepodge of confusion, political bickering, an ingrained don't-rock-the-boat attitude within the school system bureaucracy, charges that the Environmental Protection Agency has failed to establish clear rules for determining asbestos health risks, and complaints that federal deadlines are unrealistic. Meanwhile, parents have begun to question the safety of the classroom environment and are not getting straightforward answers. One concerned mother, whose child is a first-grader at Beverly Vista Elementary School, said: \"I have always trusted the school system completely in matters of safety. Now, I don't know what to believe.\" At Beverly Vista, one of five school sites in the Beverly Hills School District, four classrooms, including a kindergarten setting, were recently found to contain friable asbestos in a disintegrated form within the ceiling structure. The school is currently undergoing abatement in these critical areas. The Asbestos Cleanup legislation of 1986, which arose from dissatisfaction with existing EPA efforts to regulate asbestos, mandated that the nation's schools clean up hazardous asbestos on their premises and required the EPA to issue standards for school inspection, cleanup and disposal of the insulating material. If friable asbestos-containing materials are found in schools, the Emergency Response Act requires not only inspections by EPA-accredited consultants but an asbestos management plan for ongoing control of the release of asbestos fibers, even when the materials do not pose an immediate hazard. The management plan also activates immediate repair of damage and building cleanup, where needed, and requires all school maintenance and custodial staff to be trained through EPA-approved courses. One of the inconsistencies of EPA guidelines, said one asbestos consultant, is that the agency has left it up to the individual states to implement the format and design Contractor Accreditation Plans, resulting in a wide range of quality control standards. Under previous regulations issued in 1982, schools were required to inspect for asbestos and to notify parents and employees of the results. But EPA rulings at that time did not explicitly mandate schools to take remedial action. \"Even today, the magnitude of the asbestos cleanup problem in schools is clearly not understood by vast numbers of untrained people assigned by school administrators to see that the new requirements are carried out,\" said Gordon Goldman, president of Asbestos Environmental Controls, a Torrance-based asbestos inspection and consulting firm, whose clients currently include school districts in Illinois, Louisiana and California, including 25 school districts within Los Angeles County.\" Parents Short-Changed \"Furthermore, I do not believe the responsibility for the asbestos problem in schools should be assigned to business or insurance risk managers within the school districts who have little or no knowledge of the dangerous consequences in the poor handling of hazardous substances,\" added Goldman, who has a doctorate degree in organic chemistry. \"I think parents have been short-changed. One simply cannot treat a life-threatening issue, in the same routine fashion as ordering 100 bags of potatoes for the school cafeteria. \"It takes time and special skills to do a good job,\" said Goldman, who believes the federal deadlines are too stringent and that many of the districts have pushed through shabby inspections. \"There are simply not enough people to do the job. We need at least twice as many qualified inspectors as we have now.\" Goldman, whose crew targeted the critical areas at Beverly Vista in a preliminary inspection, said he also found evidence of potentially dangerous asbestos conditions at Beverly Hills High School. Acted Immediately Mike Farrow, director of maintenance for the Beverly Hills School District, said the district sites had undergone previous asbestos inspections and that corrective work had been done in the past. \"I believe we have a handle on this problem now,\" he added. \"At Beverly Vista, we acted immediately to remedy the situation after the problem was pointed out to us. We certainly don't want our students exposed to a dangerous environment.\" Studies have shown that the level of airborne fibers inside asbestos-containing buildings varies little from the level outside the buildings (in California it is fairly well impregnated with airborne fibers from the weathering of native serpentine rock and dust from other building materials). The increased risk of asbestos-related health hazards in schools, arises when school officials fail to monitor these conditions, through regular inspections and implementation of corrective measures, before a critical condition develops, said Peter MacDowell, a Los Angeles-based asbestos abatement expert. \"Friable asbestos in a crumbled form can literally fall through cracks. In each instance where friable asbestos surfaces are disturbed, by varying degrees of contact to its surfaces, by water damage from a leaky roof or pipe or dislodgement caused by earth tremors, friability will occur, and minute airborne particles will make their way into the air stream,\" MacDowell said. How often are plants or decorations hung unwittingly from a ceiling in a classroom, containing asbestos? How often are acoustic tiles shoved aside by untrained custodians to access ceilings where beams have been sprayed for fireproofing and insulation with friable asbestos substances? MacDowell said \"the same can happen when an untrained repairman replaces a phone or electric line or, even worse, breaks into an asbestos treated area to connect a computer terminal.\" Personally Liable He urged that parent-teacher organizations should take a pro-active stance. \"Every school should form a committee of interested parents to demand full disclosure of progress of prudent response to AHERA requirements. What people are not aware of is that the local asbestos designee for a school district is in fact personally liable for his actions. That, in itself, I'm sure, has not been conveyed to those responsible. I wonder how many of them ever really read the act.\" The federal government's asbestos emergency response legislation, sponsored by Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.) and signed by President Reagan on Oct. 22, 1986, bears down on the problem with new, strict standards for asbestos contractor certification and training, inspections, lab accreditation and procedures for asbestos management and abatement programs in the nation's schools. Compliance, however, has not been that simple and school officials fear that when management plans are completed and a full schedule of abatement work is determined, they will not be able to meet the high costs of such management. Because of the complexity and confusion about the asbestos problem, of what is dangerous and what is not, both from a technical and health standpoint, the tendency in some sectors has been to minimize the danger of this environmental problem, leading some lawmakers to wonder whether the issue has become too emotional. Second Thoughts Parents who voted for Proposition 79 (approved on the Nov. 8 ballot) and were led to believe that the School Facilities Bond Act (Proposition 79) specifically set aside \"up to $100 million to be used for the identification, assessment and abatement of hazardous asbestos,\" should be aware of second thoughts by some members of the California Legislature. A lobbyist for the California School Boards Assn. said that on Nov. 30, the State Allocation Board discussed limiting Proposition 79 funds for asbestos work in schools in favor of using more funds for school construction. Such redrafting of guidelines by the board does not require voter approval, he emphasized, adding that the only schools currently qualifying for allocation of funds from Proposition 79 are those where the asbestos problem is so critical that the school is shut down. Under that scenario, only the Hiram-Johnson School in the Sacramento Unified School District has qualified, thus far. To keep the issue in perspective, asbestos experts offer reassurance that all asbestos in buildings is not dangerous, that some 3,000 asbestos products were used in construction prior to 1973 for structural fireproofing, acoustical ceilings, pipe and boiler insulation or furnace systems but that these differences have not been brought to the attention of the Resource and Recovery Act, the Congress or the public. Risks 'Overstated' \"It is important to clarify these differences,\" said Ed Kennedy, a K & D asbestos consultant, formerly involved with inspections within the Beverly Hills School District and currently overseeing some of the work being carried out in various school districts. \"The word asbestos, as used in the law, is too generic a term for a large group of minerals of different chemical compositions and morphology which are not equally carcinogenic or health hazardous.\" Dr. Robert N. Sawyer, a Connecticut-based consultant in industrial medicine, believes the EPA has overstated the risks in schools and neglected to clarify and communicate the variables connected with friable asbestos exposure. \"Any asbestos-containing material does not necessarily represent a threat to human safety. I would rather see more emphasis and regulation by the EPA on cigarette smoking, which poses a much higher health risk to young lungs. Those most at risk from asbestos in schools are the maintenance and custodial workers working in areas where friable asbestos is found,\" Sawyer said, \"although, in certain instances, where children are directly exposed to friable asbestos, a definite health hazard could exist and that should be corrected.\" In EPA terms, Kennedy stated, friable asbestos means asbestos that, when dry, can be crumbled with light to harder hand pressure and can be so fragile that all one has to do to dislodge is to blow on it. Complex Relationship \"But we must also remember that some asbestos sprayed on for insulation and fireproofing carries a cementitious binder or mineral fiber binder that makes it more resistant to crumbling.\" The EPA \"Purple Book,\" issued in June, 1985, states that \"there is no direct information on health risks from exposure to asbestos in buildings with asbestos-containing materials, so the risks are estimated by extrapolation from studies of asbestos industry workers.\" A once-common building material, asbestos is linked to asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma (also known as black lung disease) in individuals with a history of prolonged or excessive exposure to high levels of asbestos fibers. But the EPA report also notes that \"asbestos exposure in children is of special concern, since they (the children) have a greater remaining life span than adults and their lifetime risk of developing mesothelioma is greater. Avoiding unnecessary exposure to asbestos is prudent.\" MacDowell believes \"if we must overreact in some undefined health and safety issues where children are concerned, then let us all be on the side of conservatism, until such time as more accurate data and statistics become available. \"As adults we have a choice as to our work conditions but the children who are sent off to school every morning to an asbestos-laden site, don't have that choice.\"", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA010889-0062", "score": 7.180200099945068}, {"content": "Title: Content: Chemical and Biological Substances Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI in Russian No. 124, 1993 pp 4-5 Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Russian BFN [Instructions on Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances, approved by V.

State registration is implemented in a Russian Register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as Register) for detection, accumulation of physicochemical, toxicological, ecotoxicological and other information, record-keeping and regulation of said substances in order to prevent their deleterious effects on human health and the environment. 1.4. An individual naturally occurring or synthetic substance (compound) that can have a deleterious effect on human health and the environment, when produced, used, transported, processed, as well as in household use, is considered a potentially hazardous chemical and/or biological substance. 1.5. All individual chemical and biological substances (compounds), including those contained in mixtures, produced and/or used on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as imported substances, are subject to State registration. Substances containing impurities formed in the production process or when used are registered as individual substances. 1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No. 1, dated 5 January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [Russian State committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not subject to State registration. 1.7. The procedure for State registration established in these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered following previously established procedure by pertinent organizations. 1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are subject to registration prior to production and use. Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March 1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State registration within three years from the time of publication of these instructions. Specific registration dates must be coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 July 1993. 2. Procedure for State Registration 2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well as individuals responsible for production and import of a given substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 2.2. The registration process includes receiving applications, examining them and making the decision to register, and issuing a registration certificate. 2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificated with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of submitted information is determined in each specific instance by the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and methodological documentation. If an applicant does not submit the necessary information within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the registration certificate is no longer valid. 2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, which is confirmed following established procedure, representing institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases related to making decisions on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a State registration number and issuance of a registration certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and ``Environmental protection.'' 2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and use conditions for a substance with a State registration number to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU, and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and Ministry Environmental Protection of the Russian Federation in accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation. 2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by the director of the Register. 2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the Statute approved by Decree No. 552 of the Russian Federation Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance and material-technical support of the system of State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy Lane, 18-20. 2.11. Documentation for registration must include: 2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise administrator or individual entrepreneur; 2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances'' (Appendix 1); 2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of information....'' was filled out; 2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration fee; 2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible publication of State registration materials in the free press. 2.12.

An expert forensic psychiatric opinion is obtained in institutions of the State or municipal health care system designated for this purpose. The citizen or his legal representative has the right to submit a petition to the agency that ordered the forensic medical or forensic psychiatric expert opinion for inclusion in the commission of experts of an additional specialist in the appropriate field, with consent of the latter. The procedure for organizing and providing expert forensic medical and forensic psychiatric opinions is established by legislation of the Federation. The conclusions of institutions providing expert forensic medical and forensic psychiatric opinions may be appealed following procedure established by legislation of the Federation. Article 53. Independent expert medical opinion If citizens disagree with the expert medical conclusion, an independent expert medical opinion is obtained upon their request in the appropriate form, as stipulated in articles 43 and 41 of these Fundamentals. An expert opinion is deemed independent when the expert or commission members who prepare it are not related either through work or other factor to the institution or commission that provided the expert medical opinion, as well as agencies, institutions, officials and individuals concerned with the results of independent expertise. The statute on independent expert medical opinions is approved by the Federation Government. Citizens have the right to choose the expert institution and experts toprovide an independent expert medical opinion. In case of dispute, the final decision as to conclusion of the medical experts is made by a court. Section X. Rights and Social Protection of Medical and Pharmaceutical Personnel Article 54.

Basis for the Determination Not To List as Hazardous Wastes From Wood Surface Protection Operations As discussed in the proposed rule, in making a hazardous waste listing determination, the Agency applies a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach. In doing this, the Agency examines the risks associated with all potential human health and environmental exposure pathways, analyzes trends in the current industry, researches past damage incidents, as well as other factors found in 40 CFR 261.11. Upon reviewing and responding to comments received on the proposed rule, the Agency has decided not to list as hazardous wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in the wood surface protection industry for several reasons. First, chlorophenolic formulations are no longer being produced in the United States and the Agency believes it is very unlikely they will be produced in the future. The only remaining producer of chlorophenolics in the U.S., Chapman Chemicals, stopped production in January of 1992 and sometime later applied for voluntary cancellation of its FIFRA product registration. A notice describing this action was published in the Federal Register on June 3, 1992 (57 FR 23401), and a final cancellation order was sent to Chapman Chemicals with an effective date of September 14, 1992. This cancellation notice applies to the following products produced by Chapman Chemicals: Permatox 181, 10S, and 101, and Mitrol G-ST. Any manufacturer wishing to resume production of chlorophenolics would have to obtain a new FIFRA registration before these chemicals could be re-introduced and made available for use in wood surface protection. Currently, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics in the U.S. out of an estimated 1000 previous users and the remaining plant's existing stock is believed to be very limited. A major element in the decision not to list as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes generated from the surface protection industry is the fact that use of chlorophenolic formulations has ceased. EPA believes it is highly unlikely that a manufacturer will seek reregistration for this product for many reasons, including the availability of effective substitute products and the potentially high financial and administrative burdens imposed by the FIFRA registration process. Additional justification to support non-future production is the fact that European countries do not want to accept dioxin-containing wood products which have affected large export mills who will not use chlorophenolic formulations in the future in part for this reason. Use of chlorophenolics for surface protection has declined steadily (even without the influence of RCRA) from over 1,000 users to one user over the past decade. Should a new registration of this product be sought, EPA will consider this surface protection risk analysis for full strength application when determining whether a new listing determination under RCRA should be initiated. Currently, the Agency is aware of nine available substitute products currently being used by surface protectors in place of chlorophenolics. The substitute products are for a large part satisfactory to their users (as mentioned on various site trips), and the Agency does not feel as though a switch back to chlorophenolics is likely. A second reason why the Agency has decided not to list these wastes is because the risk to human health and the environment from on-going operations which previously used chlorophenolics is shown to tail off quickly because chlorophenolic concentrations diminish to a near zero concentration within a short period of time following switchover to an alternate product. The Agency has determined that the use of full-strength chlorophenolic formulations generates wastes that result in unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. As before mentioned, should the use of chlorophenolics for surface protection applications resume, for any reason, the Agency will most likely re-evaluate its current position. However, dealing with the current situation, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics with a limited supply remaining. Although the Agency believes the use of full-strength chlorophenolics will be phased out in the very near future, there was concern at the time of proposal that there may be unacceptable risks posed by the use of substitute products that become cross-contaminated from previous chlorophenolic use. Particularly, the proposal cited possible ground water risks of 2\u00d710 ^4 for individuals and a broad but very low potential exposure risk due to surface run-off contributing to dioxin levels in fish. The Agency received several comments addressing these potential impacts. In response to these comments, the Agency conducted additional ground-water modeling using new pulse assumptions developed from commenter-submitted information. The Agency developed what it believed to be better pulse assumptions in an effort to determine how long pentachlorophenate will be present in on-going operations which have switched over from its past use. This new data was obtained from performing mass balance iterations using typical tank volumes found at both large and small facilities. These mathematical calculations showed that cross-contamination from previous use of chlorophenolics will be present in a substitute products for only two to six years from the time a plant stops using chlorophenolics. The Agency found that the highest estimated risk to an individual from drinking ground water for nine years at peak concentrations in the two- or six-year pulse resulting from cross contamination, is significantly diminished and the broad effect on dioxin levels in fish is reduced by several orders of magnitude. This new analysis shows that the risks associated with cross-contamination do not justify a hazardous waste listing to capture cross-contaminated wastes. In the proposed rule, EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk estimates, which have been revised in the final rule to reflect source concentrations and pulse durations more representative of the cross-contamination, incremental-risk scenario. Chart 1 below compares the incremental risks from cross-contaminated wastes as calculated for the proposed rule to the values obtained using the new approach.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940104-0-00062", "score": 7.131700038909912}, {"content": "Title: Content: March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; COUNTYWIDE; DUMPING PLAN SOUGHT FOR HOUSEHOLD WASTES To discourage illegal dumping of household hazardous wastes, county health officials are proposing the creation of two special collection stations at existing landfills and working with four private stations elsewhere in the county to handle such materials. Operating the pilot program would cost about $1.2 million a year. To pay for it, county officials have proposed a 25-cent a ton surcharge on trash deposited at county landfills. The proposal is part of a series of changes in landfill fees recommended by county health and waste management experts. Under the plan, the basic landfill rate on July 1 would jump from the current fee of $11 per ton to $13.75 per ton, which includes the surcharge. Fees for individual trucks using the landfills would increase from $4 to $5 a load, but the rate for individual cars would remain at $3 per load. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the proposal at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. The fee increases are being proposed to offset the costs of the planned closings of the Coyote Canyon landfill south of Irvine and the Santiago Canyon landfill east of Orange later this year, and the simultaneous opening of the Bee Canyon Landfill northeast of Irvine, officials said. Complying with more stringent environmental regulations for disposing and handling trash also has proved more costly for the county. The special collection stations for household hazardous wastes would be created at existing landfills in Brea and San Juan Capistrano.

Background Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act states: If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that determination in the Federal Register . After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for federal assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer. Although EPA has the authority to initiate ``sole source aquifer'' designations, the Agency has a policy of acting only in response to petitions. Petitions may be submitted to EPA by any individual or organization and must address procedures and criteria outlined in EPA's ``Sole Source Aquifer Designation Petitioner Guidance'', EPA 440/6&hyph;87&hyph;003. On April 2, 1992, EPA Region 10 received a petition from the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health requesting that EPA designate Vashon-Maury Island as a sole source aquifer. The petition was developed in cooperation with the Vashon-Maury Island Ground Water Advisory Committee and the Vashon-Maury Island Water Utilities Coordinating Committee. Recognizing the value of the aquifer as a present and future source of drinking water, the petition was submitted as an additional way to protect the Island's ground water resources. EPA's initial review of the petition led to a request for additional hydrogeologic and water usage information. This information was subsequently submitted to EPA by the petitioner. On October 21, 1992, the petition was considered complete enough to undergo a more detailed technical review. The technical review was completed in April of 1994 and EPA's findings and basis for the proposed designation were documented in EPA's Support Document.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940705-2-00124", "score": 7.087500095367432}, {"content": "Title: Content: The Agency is adding this new provision to the final rule in large part because it is allowing prior training to be accepted in place of a new round of training. OSHA recognizes, given the transient nature of the workforce in this industry, that in many cases an employer will be unable to identify the date on which previous training was provided by another employer. In those cases, OSHA believes that knowing the date of the prior training is not as important as the employer's determination as to whether the prior training is adequate. As such, OSHA is requiring employers to certify on what date they determine the prior training to be adequate. In the final rule OSHA has included a measurable way to determine when and whether prior training had been adequate. The final rule requires that each new employee work under close supervision of a designated person until the employee demonstrates the ability to safely perform the job independently. In most cases, therefore, this demonstration date will constitute the certification date. Paragraph (i)(10)(ii) of the final rule requires that the most recent training certification be maintained. This provision has been included to limit the number of records that the employer is required to maintain on training. Paragraph (i)(11) of the final rule requires that the employer hold safety and health meetings as necessary and at least each month for each employee. This provision allows safety and health meetings to be conducted individually, in crew meetings, in larger groups, or as part of other staff meetings. The proposed rule did not contain a safety and health meeting requirement. Many State logging standards also require regular safety and health meetings in the logging industry (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 36, 38K). For example, the State of Washington logging standard requires safety meetings to be held monthly and whenever work is started at a new work site. Many commenters supported the need for regular and ongoing safety and health meetings for both inexperienced and experienced workers (Ex. 5&hyph;7, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, OR 92, 110, 137, 197, 204, 276, 335, 374, 643&hyph;44, 691&hyph;92). Several of these commenters indicated that many establishments in the industry already hold safety and health meetings on a regular basis. Several commenters said safety and health meetings were an effective way of informing employees about hazards and keeping their safety awareness high (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28; Tr. W1 93&hyph;95, 163, 189&hyph;90, OR 92, 110, 137, 204, 276, 374, 643&hyph;44). One commenter said that documented monthly safety and health meetings were necessary on all logging operations ``to instill the necessary safe work attitude in all logging employees'' (Ex. 5&hyph;28). Commenters also said safety and health meetings were good for providing targeted information (Tr. W1 94, 164, 189, OR 110, 204&hyph;05, 373, 643). For example, they said safety and health meetings were a way of informing employees about recent accidents and about lapses in safe work practices, and to alert employees about conditions and hazards peculiar to the job to be performed or the site to be logged that day. Commenters also said that safety and health meetings were necessary for both inexperienced and experienced loggers (Ex. 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;28, 5&hyph;45; Tr. OR 335). One of these commenters said: We don't feel that just new employees or green men ought to be sitting in safety and health meetings. Repetition increases retention, and everyone can benefit if they've heard it a hundred times. Maybe they forgot it 99 [times] and it might save their life or their buddy's life the next day (Tr. OR 335). OSHA agrees with these commenters that safety and health meetings are necessary to reinforce proper work practices and to alert employees to particular hazards which are present in the workplace. OSHA believes that regular safety and health meetings will provide adequate retraining for employees in the logging industry, and that these meetings are necessary in lieu of requiring annual retraining of experienced workers.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941012-0-00151", "score": 7.087200164794922}, {"content": "Title: Content: Hazardous waste is defined at Section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types of hazardous waste. First, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality, serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a7261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11 states three criteria for identifying characteristics and for listing wastes as hazardous. First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties described at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;24 which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity. Second, wastes may be classified as acutely hazardous if they are fatal to humans at low doses, lethal in animal studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious illness. Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in Appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors enumerated in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. Such wastes are designated as toxic wastes. A substance is listed in Appendix VIII if it has been shown in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms. Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who generate, transport, treat, store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazardous waste management requirements, including the need to obtain permits to operate, commonly are referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue those regulations for hazardous wastes as may be necessary to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or landfills that are required to comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators or landfills. Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6921 through 6939(e)). EPA standards and procedural regulations implementing Subtitle C are found generally at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. Solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities that are overseen by state and local governments. These are the so-called Subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that deals with federal assistance to state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste. Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6941 through 6949(a)). EPA regulations affecting Subtitle D facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru 247, and 255 thru 258. Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921(e)(2)) requires EPA to determine whether to list as hazardous wastes generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of dyes and pigments. In June of 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree in a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund, et al. ( EDF v. Reilly, Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598 (D.D.C.), hereinafter referred to as the settlement agreement), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as to whether or not to list as hazardous certain wastes from the production of dyes and pigments by November 30, 1994 and to promulgate a final decision by November 30, 1995. There are three major classes of dyes and pigments: Azo/benzidine, anthraquinone, and triarylmethane. The settlement agreement specifies that the listing is to address the azo, monoazo, diazo, triazo, polyazo, azoic, and benzidine categories of the azo/benzidine dye and pigment class; the anthraquinone and perylene categories of the anthraquinone dye and pigment class; and the triarylmethane, triphenylmethane, and pyrazolone categories of the triarylmethane dye and pigment class. The settlement agreement also specifies that the listing is to address the following types of wastes where they are found: spent catalysts, reactor still overheads, vacuum system condensate, process waters, spent adsorbent, equipment cleaning sludge, product mother liquor, product standardization filter cake, dust collector filter fines, recovery still bottoms, treated wastewater effluent, and wastewater treatment sludge. As part of its regulations implementing Section 3001(e) of RCRA, EPA published a list of hazardous wastes that includes hazardous wastes generated from non-specific sources and a list of hazardous wastes from specific sources. These lists have been amended several times, and are published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 40 CFR 261.32, respectively. In this action, EPA is proposing to amend 40 CFR 261.32 to add five wastes from specific sources generated during the production of dyes and pigments. Those hazardous constituents that are proposed to be included in Appendix VII to part 261, Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste, also are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII of Part 261, the list of Hazardous Constituents, if not already included in this list. All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are also hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to list the proposed wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4. EPA is not taking action at this time to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances. B. EPA's Hazardous Waste Listing Determination Policy EPA believes that it should provide the public with a better understanding of the basis for EPA's listing decisions. Accordingly, EPA presents here the general approach the Agency uses for determining whether to list a waste as hazardous pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3). This presentation focuses on selection of waste management scenarios used in assessing risk and the use of information on risk levels in making listing determinations. These elements are an important part of EPA's general listing policy and critical aspects to the dyes and pigments listing determination. It is important to note that this discussion presents EPA's general listing policy and is not a rulemaking. The Agency may take action at variance with this general policy. The Agency is seeking comment on its policy in order to get input from the public, not in order to promulgate binding rules for listing determinations. The Agency will review any comments received and may revise its policy based on such comments. However, the Agency does not intend to respond to comments submitted. The listing criteria described here focus on several aspects of the Agency's listing determination process. The discussion is not intended to cover all potential aspects of these determinations. For example, analyzing population risk is not included in this presentation. The Agency solicits comment on how population risks could be included as a factor in listing determinations. The Agency's approach to calculating distributions of individual risk values when determining ``high end'' risk and the Agency's position on how far into the future it will consider risk are not covered in today's notice. The Agency solicits comment on these factors and their use in listing determinations.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00023", "score": 7.081399917602539}, {"content": "Title: Content: As described at proposal (56 FR 33496, July 22, 1991), the EPA decided in both the first and second phases to develop standards that control organic emissions as a class (as opposed to constituent-by-constituent). Implementation of these nationwide standards will achieve significant organic emission and cancer risk reductions. However, the EPA estimates the cancer risk at a few TSDF after implementation of these nationwide standards to remain at a level that is higher than the range of target risk levels for other promulgated RCRA standards (refer to section V.C of this preamble.) The third phase of this regulatory development program is to determine what other actions are necessary to attain the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n). To make this determination, the EPA is evaluating hazardous waste operations at those individual TSDF estimated to have MIR values greater than the historical RCRA target MIR levels. B. Public Participation in Rulemaking The EPA is promulgating today's final rule after careful consideration of public comments on the proposed rule (56 FR 33491, July 22, 1991). The preamble to the proposed rule discussed the availability of the background information document (BID) pertaining to the health effects of organic emissions from hazardous waste TSDF using tanks, surface impoundments, and containers. The EPA mailed copies of the Federal Register notice and the BID for the proposed rule to industry representatives, environmental groups, and State and Federal agencies. The EPA solicited comments from the public at the time of proposal and provided a 90-day comment period, from July 22, 1991 to October 21, 1991, for the public to prepare and submit written comments on the proposed rule. In addition, the EPA provided the opportunity for a public hearing to allow interested persons to present oral comments to the EPA concerning the proposed rule. However, no one requested that the EPA hold a public hearing on the proposed rule. The EPA did receive written comments from more than 80 companies, industrial trade associations, environmental groups, and State and Federal agencies. The BID for the final rule summarizes all of the comments on the proposed rule and presents the EPA's response to each of the comments. Section VI of this preamble presents responses to selected major comments. Following the EPA's review of public comments received on the proposed rule, the EPA revised the impact analysis used for its final determination regarding today's rulemaking. This analysis used additional TSDF industry data obtained by the EPA. The EPA provided an opportunity for public comment on the additional TSDF industry data used for the impact modeling revisions. A Federal Register Notice of Data Availability (57 FR 43171, September 18, 1992) listed these additional data. The EPA also made the data available for public inspection at the EPA RCRA Docket Office. A 30-day comment period, from September 18, 1992 to October 19, 1992, provided the public the opportunity to comment on the additional data. The EPA received comments on the additional data from one industrial trade association. Section VI.B of this preamble presents a summary of these comments. C. Relationship to Other RCRA Standards 1. RCRA Rules for TSDF Owners and Operators Today's action establishes organic air emission control requirements for TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and certain containers. Other types of waste management units operated at TSDF may be subject to these air emission control requirements as follows. a. Miscellaneous units. Under RCRA in 40 CFR 260.10, the EPA defines a ``miscellaneous unit'' as a hazardous waste management unit where waste is treated, stored, or disposed of that is not a container, tank, surface impoundment, wastepile, land treatment unit, landfill, incinerator, boiler, industrial furnace, underground injection well with appropriate technical standards under 40 CFR part 146, or a unit eligible for a research, development, and demonstration permit under 40 CFR 270.65. The EPA has established provisions under 40 CFR part 264, subpart X to allow TSDF owners and operators to obtain permits to operate miscellaneous units. The EPA permits miscellaneous units on a case-by-case basis with terms and provisions as needed to protect public health and the environment through generic performance standards specified in 40 CFR 264.601. Today's rule amends \u00a7264.601 to state that the air emission controls required by the standards under 40 CFR 264 subparts AA, BB, and CC are among the ``appropriate'' controls a permit writer may require for a miscellaneous unit ``to ensure protection of human health and the environment.'' Applicability of today's rule to miscellaneous units is discussed further in Section VII.B of this preamble. b. Land disposal restrictions. The RCRA LDR treatment standards under 40 CFR part 268 require TSDF owners and operators to treat hazardous waste to reduce the toxicity or mobility of specific constituents in the waste before the TSDF owner or operator can place the waste in a land disposal unit. Under certain conditions, the EPA may grant a TSDF owner or operator permission to land dispose a hazardous waste that does not meet the LDR treatment standards in a particular land treatment unit, landfill, wastepile, or surface impoundment. This action is referred to as the ``no migration'' variance. To obtain a ``no migration'' variance, a TSDF owner or operator must demonstrate in a petition to the EPA that, with a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941206-0-00144", "score": 7.055799961090088}, {"content": "Title: Content: Thursday May 19, 1994 Part IV Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Ch.

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intent to establish special controls, including the promulgation of performance standards, for medical devices that use electrode lead wires. The agency is taking this action because it has determined that special controls are needed to prevent hazardous electrical connections between patients and electrical power sources. FDA is also announcing a public conference on this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). FDA will consider any comments or other information received in response to this ANPRM and information gleaned from the conference when proposing the special controls for devices using electrode lead wires. DATES: Written comments by August 17, 1994. The public conference will be held on July 15, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. To register for the conference, please contact Sociometric, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) issued an alert letter in June 1985 to manufacturers, home user support organizations, and apnea monitor users, announcing that CDRH had received reports of one death and two electrical burns that occurred when unsupervised children plugged the male connector pins of the electrode lead wires from a home apnea monitor system into either alternating current (AC) power cords or a wall outlet, rather than into the patient cable which connects to the monitor (Ref. 1). In that letter, the agency announced its intention to embark on a cooperative effort with industry and the medical profession to resolve the problem of potential electrical connection between patients and electrical power sources. FDA also requested each manufacturer to evaluate its device for potential electrode lead wire and patient cable hazards and, when necessary, to consider design changes to preclude insertion of lead wire connectors into AC power cords and outlets. In response, manufacturers voluntarily began to redesign their electrode lead wires and patient cables for home apnea monitors. In addition to issuing the alert letter, CDRH's July 1985 Medical Devices Bulletin (a periodic publication that is distributed to the healthcare community and manufacturers) was devoted in great part to publicizing the lead wire hazard (Ref. 2). Since 1985, FDA has cleared for marketing only those home use apnea monitors with patient cables and lead wires designed to prevent unsafe electrical connections. This protective design has also been required for all apnea monitors cleared for marketing since 1989, whether or not they were intended for home use. Nonetheless, some hospitals continue to use older units, or lead wires and patient cables from other devices, which do not have the protective design. Even with the new models, it may be possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires, thereby creating a hazard. On August 25, 1993, a 12-day old infant being monitored for apnea was electrocuted in a hospital, in Chicago, IL. FDA's investigation of the incident confirmed that the patient electrode lead wires were unprotected. Specifically, the male connector pins were not protected to prevent unsafe electrical connections. Although the infant apnea monitor involved in that incident had been sold with safety protected lead wires and patient cable, an unprotected patient cable from another manufacturer and unprotected lead wires from a third manufacturer were being used when the infant was electrocuted. In response to this incident, on September 3, 1993, FDA issued a safety alert to hospital administrators, risk managers, and pediatric department directors, warning them that the use of unsafe electrode lead wires with an apnea monitor may be dangerous to the patient, and may be in violation of section 518(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360h(a)) (Ref. 3). FDA included in the alert a number of recommendations to help prevent these accidents. On that same day, FDA also sent all apnea monitor manufacturers a notification letter under section 518(a) of the act (Ref. 4). Section 518(a) of the act authorizes the agency to require that notification be provided when it is necessary to eliminate an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health and when no other practicable means is available under the act to eliminate such risk. FDA determined that manufacturer notification under section 518(a) of the act to all hospitals, clinics, distributors, and suppliers of apnea monitors was necessary to eliminate the unreasonable risk of harm to infants and other apnea monitor patients from unprotected lead wires and patient cables. FDA stated that notification should include replacement of unprotected lead wires and patient cables, and that a warning label should be permanently affixed to all monitors stating that unprotected lead wires and patient cables should not be used with the device because inappropriate electrical connections may pose an unreasonable risk of adverse health consequences or death. FDA also requested manufacturers of all apnea monitors to cease further distribution of unprotected lead wires and patient cables. On September 20, 1993, FDA issued a similar letter to all known manufactures of patient cables and lead wires (Ref. 5). FDA also has received reports of injuries associated with unsafe lead wires and patient cables involving medical devices other than apnea monitors (Ref. 6). In 1986, for example, a death resulted in a hospital from electrocardiogram (ECG) lead wires being plugged into an infusion pump power cord. Similarly, in 1990, a death occurred when neonatal monitor lead wires were inserted into a pulse oximeter power cord. FDA has received additional reports of similar events that resulted in electrical shocks and burns to patients. The agency also has received reports of ECG monitor lead wires being inserted into power sources, causing patient injuries. Finally, FDA has received one report of patient shock involving an electroencephalograph cable. Manufacturers of devices other than apnea monitors that utilize patient electrodes, e.g., ECG, have been encouraged by various organizations to modify their lead wires so that they cannot be inserted into AC power cords or outlets. In February 1987 and May 1993, the Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) issued hazard reports concerning electrical shock hazards from unprotected lead wires and patient cables in its publication ``Health Devices'' (Ref. 7). On July 15, 1991, the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) amended its Standard for Medical and Dental Equipment (UL 544) to require patient-connected lead wires to be designed to avoid connection to electrical power sources. This requirement became effective on December 1, 1991 (Ref. 8). In March 1993, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) published a standard for ECG machines, including a safety requirement for leads (601&hyph;2&hyph;25) (Ref. 9). The IEC, as well as the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), are in the process of developing a standard for all leads. There is also an existing German standard (DIN 42 802) which has been adopted by some U.S. manufacturers in their design of safety protected lead wires (Ref. 10). On December 28, 1993, FDA issued a Public Health Advisory to hospital nursing directors, risk managers, and biomedical/clinical engineering departments for distribution to all units in their hospitals and outpatient clinics, as well as to home health care providers and suppliers affiliated with those facilities, advising them of the hazards associated with use of electrode lead wires with unprotected male connector pins. (Ref. 11). In the Public Health Advisory, FDA expanded the scope of its September 3, 1993, apnea monitor safety alert to include all devices using patient electrodes. FDA noted that, even though manufacturers have changed the design of their devices to minimize the potential hazard, some facilities are still using older models that make it possible for staff to switch patient cables and/or lead wires, thus creating a hazard. FDA recommended various precautions to prevent the use of unsafe lead wires and patient cables. II. Revisions Under Consideration In accordance with section 513(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(a)), FDA has classified medical devices intended for human use into one of three regulatory classes, i.e., class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class III, premarket approval. Classification depends on the extent of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of each device. Apnea monitors, as well as many other medical devices that use patient electrodes, are classified into class II. Class II devices are devices for which general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance (see 21 CFR 860.3(c)(2)). Possible special controls include the issuance of performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section 510(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)), recommendations, and other appropriate actions as FDA deems necessary to provide such assurance. (See section 513(a)(1)(B) of the act.) The agency recognizes that, despite efforts to eliminate the risk, unprotected lead wires and patient cabling systems are still distributed by some manufacturers as replacements for existing equipment, and may also be interchangeable among various medical devices. In order to reduce the risks to health presented by these devices, the agency is considering establishing special controls for devices that use lead wires. The agency believes these controls should include, but not be limited to, the development of a performance standard. FDA believes that the development of a performance standard is necessary to reduce or eliminate the hazards of unprotected lead wires and patient cables. The DIN standard is a design, rather than a performance, standard, and may be too restrictive for application to all devices. While the proposed AAMI and IEC standards for all leads are more general, they are not yet completed. Therefore, the agency is considering establishing a standard that resembles the UL standard. The agency will consider other standards, however, that are finalized before completion of this rulemaking process. FDA is also considering revising CDRH's Office of Device Evaluation's ``blue book'' to reflect the agency's policy of not clearing for marketing unprotected male pins that may be used with any device with patient electrodes. FDA is soliciting comments on the issuance of a performance standard that would eliminate the risk of burns and death associated with placing an unprotected electrode lead wire directly into a power source. FDA is soliciting comments on all aspects of this ANPRM, and specifically requests comments on the following issues: 1. The current extent of manufacturing, distribution, and use of unprotected patient cables and electrode lead wires as replacement products. 2. Advantages, if any, of using unprotected electrode lead wires with particular medical devices. 3. The devices, if there are any, that cannot accept redesigned electrode lead wires or patient cables. 4. Cost to manufacturers and the user community to convert to protected electrode lead wires and patient cables for all medical devices. 5. Extent of substitution, if any, of unprotected nonmedical electrode lead wires and patient cables, for use as medical device electrode lead wires and patient cables. 6. Essential components of a performance standard for lead wires and patient cables. 7. Viability of applying a performance standard across device types. 8. Alternative solutions to the removal of all unprotected electrode lead wires from the market, such as banning them under 21 CFR part 895. III. Public Conference FDA, the Health Industries Manufactures Association, and the American Hospital Association are sponsoring a public conference entitled ``Unprotected Patient Cables and Electrode Lead Wires'' to be held on July 15, 1994.

Federal Response In the United States, several agencies, including EPA, FDA, OSHA, CPSC, NIOSH, and ATSDR, have been given the mandate to regulate or evaluate public exposure to toxic chemicals (Tilson, 1989). 2.1.3.1. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has the authority to regulate the use of food and color additives as well as to determine whether or not various foods are unsafe for human consumption because of adulteration by environmental contaminants. The manufacturer must supply adequate data to establish the safety of the food additives. Before marketing approval, the potential toxicity of proposed food and color additives is established in a battery of animal toxicity studies. During all of these studies, clinical signs of toxicity, including abnormal behavior, are monitored and abnormalities recorded. At the termination of these studies, tissues from all organs, including the brain, are sectioned and evaluated for both gross and histopathological changes, in addition to being evaluated for their clinical chemistry and hematology. None of the routinely required tests is specifically designed to assess neurotoxicity. If neurotoxic effects are detected during any of the standard toxicity tests, however, they must be reported. Specific neurotoxicity testing may then be required. The FDA is currently revising its guidelines for the safety assessment of direct food and color additives to include neurotoxicity as a routine element in toxicological testing. The FDA is also authorized to regulate substances in food considered to be poisonous or deleterious. Unavoidable environmental contaminants in food fall into this category. The FDA determines a level at which the risks from realistically possible intakes are negligible or acceptable. Based on this risk assessment, an action level or tolerance is established. Once the action level or tolerance is formally established, the FDA may take appropriate action to restrict adulterated food from the market if these standards are exceeded. The FDA is responsible for assessing the toxicity of human therapeutic products. Many products have been shown to produce adverse effects on the nervous system at standard therapeutic doses as well as at higher doses. Before marketing approval is given, the toxicity of potential new products is assessed. A battery of animal toxicity study parameters relevant to the nervous system, including gross behavioral observation and gross and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue, are evaluated. This information is used to help guide the surveillance of human subjects for adverse effects that are assessed during clinical trials. 2.1.3.2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OSHA has been given the responsibility to ensure that the working environment is a safe and healthy place of employment. In the early 1970's, OSHA adopted the existing Federal standards, most of which were developed under the Walsh-Healy Act (including the 1968 ACGIH Threshold Limit Values), and approximately 20 consensus standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Of the 393 remaining original PELs, 145 were set in part to protect the individual from neurotoxic effects. Since the adoption of the initial standards, OSHA has issued new or revised health standards or work practices for 23 substances. Of these, the one concerning lead was based in part on nervous system effects. Four other compounds, inorganic arsenic, acrylonitrile, ethylene oxide, and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, were cited as causing various disturbances in the nervous system, but the standards for these were based primarily on carcinogenic effects. In 1989, OSHA updated 428 exposure limits for air contaminants. Of these, 25 substances were categorized by OSHA as ``substances for which limits are based on avoidance of neuropathic effects.'' In addition, 24 substances were included in the category ``substances for which limits are based on avoidance of narcosis.'' However, OSHA stated that the categorization was intended as a tool to manage the large number of substances being regulated and not to imply that the category selected identified the most sensitive or the exclusive adverse health effects of that substance. 2.1.3.3. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The Occupational Safety and Health Act established NIOSH as a Public Health Service (PHS) agency to develop and recommend criteria for prevention of disease and hazardous conditions in the workplace. NIOSH also performs research on occupational health issues and conducts worksite evaluations of suspected hazards. OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) use NIOSH recommendations in the promulgation of new or revised health and safety standards. In establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for chemicals, NIOSH examines all relevant scientific information about a given compound and attempts to identify exposure limits that will protect all workers from adverse effects. NIOSH has recommended standards for approximately 644 chemicals or classes of chemicals. For 214 (33 percent) of these, neurotoxicity was cited as a health effect considered when formulating the REL (NIOSH, 1992). 2.1.3.4. Environmental Protection Agency. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) provide the legislative authority for EPA to require data collection for premarket approval of chemicals. Under section 5 of TSCA, after a manufacturer has notified EPA of its plans to produce a ``new'' chemical that has not yet been listed on the inventory, EPA has the responsibility to assess possible health hazards. Potential neurotoxicity is included in the health hazards assessment. If there are reasons to suspect neurotoxicologic effects (e.g., from structure-activity analysis, information in the literature, or data submitted by the manufacturer), EPA can issue a test rule requiring the manufacturer to develop data directed toward these effects. At the same time, EPA can restrict the chemical or prohibit it entirely from entering commerce until the required data are submitted and reviewed. In addition, for ``old'' chemicals (under section 4 of TSCA), if EPA suspects neurotoxicity, a test rule would be the mechanism used for obtaining the data. Many other statutes provide authority to regulate chemicals through the setting of standards, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act. Neurotoxicity is recognized as a health effect of concern under FIFRA, and there are neurotoxicity testing requirements for premarketing submission of data to EPA for registration of a pesticide under FIFRA.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940817-2-00222", "score": 7.0071001052856445}, {"content": "Title: Content: The immediate result of Glass Melter treatment would be the conversion of waste that is primarily liquid and combustible to a stable, inorganic form that would present very little environmental concern in storage. Most of the waste would eventually require transport to a radioactive mixed waste land disposal facility. (Any waste that is not mixed waste would be disposed of with other, similar Mound wastes, e.g., hazardous waste is shipped offsite for disposal.) Environmental Impacts: In a series of test burns conducted in January 1985, the Glass Melter demonstrated the capability to thermally treat hazardous wastes in compliance with regulatory requirements. In June 1987, the Glass Melter was further tested and demonstrated effective treatment of low-level radioactive waste while meeting applicable regulatory requirements. Proposed future treatment of wastes using the Glass Melter would also meet all applicable environmental requirements. The Glass Melter is considered a ``thermal treatment unit,'' not an ``incinerator'' under the Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR 260.10). Under the regulations for miscellaneous treatment, storage, and disposal units (40 CFR Part 264, Subpart X), any permit for the glass melter may include appropriate conditions from the incinerator regulations (Subpart O). Thermal treatment is one of the limited options DOE currently has to meet the requirement for site treatment plans under the Federal Facility Compliance Act. The Environmental Protection Agency issued a Draft Strategy for Combustion of Hazardous Waste in Incinerators and Boilers on May 18, 1993, initiating a reexamination of its existing regulations and policies on waste combustion. In the draft strategy the Environmental Protection Agency indicates that, ``if conducted in compliance with regulatory standards and guidance, combustion can be a safe and effective means of disposing [of] hazardous wastes.'' To the extent that the Glass Melter would destroy hazardous wastes it would effectively ``dispose'' of that portion of the mixed waste backlog. Nevertheless, the thermal treatment of mixed wastes would necessitate the disposal of treatment residues as a mixed waste, which would be stored pending final disposal in an approved location. Emissions of nonradiological pollutants to the air during routine operations of the Glass Melter would include arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, nitrogen oxides, and particulates. Predicted concentrations of nonradiological pollutants would meet applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the maximum acceptable ground-level concentrations established by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. During routine operations of the Glass Melter the effective dose equivalent of radiation to the maximally exposed individual at the Mound Plant boundary [approximately 470 meters (510 yd) north-northeast from the Glass Melter stack] would be 0.07 mrem/year (tritium, plutonium-238, and thorium-230) from inhalation and ingestion pathways. These emissions would not cause the Mound Plant to exceed the individual effective dose equivalent limit of 10 mrem/year in the Environmental Protection Agency's National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. Based on the 1990 population distribution surrounding the Mound Plant, the collective effective dose equivalent to the total population residing within 80 km (50 mi) of the facility would be 2.6 person-rem/year. The environmental assessment shows that the health risk from such exposures would be very small.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941103-2-00019", "score": 7.003900051116943}, {"content": "Title: Content: National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences; Meeting of Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee Pursuant to Public Law 94&hyph;463, notice is hereby given of the meeting of the Environmental Health Sciences Review Committee on March 28, 1994 at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Building 101 Conference Room, South Campus, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis I. Introduction Background In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law 99&hyph;499, stat. 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action *&blank;*&blank;* and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to releases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA section 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA section 101(24)). Pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA has promulgated a list of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.'' The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo remedial action financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). However, under 40 CFR 300.425(b)(2) placing a site on the NPL ``does not imply that monies will be expended.'' EPA may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the releases, including enforcement action under CERCLA and other laws. Three mechanisms for placing sites on the NPL for possible remedial action are included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). Under 40 CFR 300.425(c)(1), a site may be included on the NPL if it scores sufficiently high on the Hazard Ranking System (``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 300. On December 14, 1990 (55 FR 51532), EPA promulgated revisions to the HRS partly in response to CERCLA section 105(c), added by SARA. The revised HRS evaluates four pathways: ground water, surface water, soil exposure, and air. The HRS serves as a screening device to evaluate the relative potential of uncontrolled hazardous substances to pose a threat to human health or the environment. Those sites that score 28.50 or greater on the HRS are eligible for the NPL. Under a second mechanism for adding sites to the NPL, each State may designate a single site as its top priority, regardless of the HRS score. This mechanism, provided by the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(2), requires that, to the extent practicable, the NPL include within the 100 highest priorities, one facility designated by each State representing the greatest danger to public health, welfare, or the environment among known facilities in the State. The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met: \u2022The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release. EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health. \u2022EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority (available only at NPL sites) than to use its removal authority to respond to the release. EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180). The NPL includes two sections, one of sites that are evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''), and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987) and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining whether the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency. Deletions/Cleanups EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 58 sites from the General Superfund Section of the NPL, most recently Charlevoix Municipal Well, Charlevoix, Michigan (58 FR 63531, December 2, 1993) and Mowbray Engineering Company, Greenville, Alabama (58 FR 69238, December 30, 1993).", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940223-0-00047", "score": 6.976099967956543}, {"content": "Title: Content: [Instructions on Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances, approved by V.

Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight as No 01-19/22-22, dated 25 May 1993; registered with the RF Ministry of Justice, registry No 279, on 18 July 1993] 1. General Statutes 1.1. These instructions were prepared to implement Decree No 869 of the Federation, dated 12 November 1992, ``On State Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances'' and in accordance with the Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances, which was adopted in the said Decree. 1.2. State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as State registration) is performed to implement the requirements in articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Federation Law on Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of the Public, and articles 51 items 2 and 3 of the Federation Law ``On Environmental Protection.'' 1.3. State registration is implemented in a Register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as Register) for detection, accumulation of physicochemical, toxicological, eco-toxicological and other information, record-keeping and regulation of said substances in order to prevent their deleterious effects on human health and the environment. 1.4. An individual naturally occurring or synthetic substance (compound) that can have a deleterious effect on human health and the environment, when produced, used, transported, processed, as well as in household use, is considered a potentially hazardous chemical and/or biological substance. 1.5. All individual chemical and biological substances (compounds), including those contained in mixtures, produced and/or used on the territory of the Federation, as well as imported substances, are subject to State registration. Substances containing impurities formed in the production process or when used are registered as individual substances. 1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No 1, dated 5 January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [ State committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not subject to State registration. 1.7. The procedure for State registration established in these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered following previously established procedure by pertinent organizations. 1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are subject to registration prior to production and use. Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of the Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March 1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State registration within three years from the time of publication of these instructions. Specific registration dates must be coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 July 1993. 2. Procedure for State Registration 2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well as individuals responsible for production and import of a given substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 2.2. The registration process includes receiving applications, examining them and making the decision to register, and issuing a registration certificate. 2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificated with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of submitted information is determined in each specific instance by the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and methodological documentation. If an applicant does not submit the necessary information within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the registration certificate is no longer valid. 2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, which is confirmed following established procedure, representing institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Ministry of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases related to making decisions on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a State registration number and issuance of a registration certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, TU and others) in the sections ``Safety requirements'' and ``Environmental protection.'' 2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and use conditions for a substance with a State registration number to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU, and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and Ministry Environmental Protection of the Federation in accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation. 2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by the director of the Register. 2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the Statute approved by Decree No 552 of the Federation Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance and material-technical support of the system of State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy Lane, 18-20. 2.11. Documentation for registration must include: 2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise administrator or individual entrepreneur; 2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances'' (Appendix 1); 2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of information....'' was filled out; 2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration fee; 2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible publication of State registration materials in the free press. 2.12. Registration materials are to be examined within 30 days. After assignment of a registration number, the Register issues a certificate of State registration of the established specimen (Appendix 2) and information form (Appendix 3) to the applicant, and publishes information about registration in the Register's information bulletin. 2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be suspended by the Register if new data are received concerning previously unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The Register notifies the applicant of suspension of the registration certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10 days of making this decision, and publishes this information in the Register's information bulletin. 2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a threat to humanhealth and environmental safety. 2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions, rightfully refuse to issue a registration certificate. 2.16. An appeal of the Register's decision must be filed, no later than 30 days after it is made, with the chairman of the Goskomsanepidnadzor. The appeal is examined within 30 days. The decision of the chairman of the Goskomsanepidnadzor may be appealed in Arbitration Court. 2.17. Enterprises and other business entities, regardless of the agency to which they pertain and form of ownership, organizations and institutions situated on the territory of the Federation, individuals carrying out development, production and use, export and import of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances bear responsibility in accordance with the ``Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' approved by Decree No 869 of the Federation Government dated 12 November 1992.

I. Danilov-Danilyan, minister of environmental protection of the RF as No 37-2-7/435, dated 25 May 1993, and by Ye. N. Belyayev, chairman of the State Committee for Sanitary and Epidemiological Oversight as No 01-19/22-22, dated 25 May 1993; registered with the RF Ministry of Justice, registry No 279, on 18 July 1993] 1. General Statutes 1.1. These instructions were prepared to implement Decree No 869 of the Federation, dated 12 November 1992, \"On State Registration of Potentially Hazardous Chemical and Biological Substances\" and in accordance with the Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances, which was adopted in the said Decree. 1.2. State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as State registration) is performed to implement the requirements in articles 12, 13, and 14 of the Federation Law on Sanitary and Epidemiological Welfare of the Public, and articles 51 items 2 and 3 of the Federation Law ``On Environmental Protection.'' 1.3. State registration is implemented in a Register of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances (hereafter referred to as Register) for detection, accumulation of physicochemical, toxicological, ecotoxicological and other information, record-keeping and regulation of said substances in order to prevent their deleterious effects on human health and the environment. 1.4. An individual naturally occurring or synthetic substance (compound) that can have a deleterious effect on human health and the environment, when produced, used, transported, processed, as well as in household use, is considered a potentially hazardous chemical and/or biological substance. 1.5. All individual chemical and biological substances (compounds), including those contained in mixtures, produced and/or used on the territory of the Federation, as well as imported substances, are subject to State registration. Substances containing impurities formed in the production process or when used are registered as individual substances. 1.6. Compound commercial chemicals, which must undergo hygienic certification in accordance with Decree No 1, dated 5 January 1993, of the Goskomsanepidnadzor [ State committee for sanitary and epidemiological oversight], are not subject to State registration. 1.7. The procedure for State registration established in these Instructions does not extend to chemical and biological agents used to protect plants, farm crop and tree plantation growth regulators, pharmaceutical preparations, as well as radioactive substances, which are recorded or registered following previously established procedure by pertinent organizations. 1.8. Chemical and biological substances intended for production and use after 31 March 1993 (``new substances'') are subject to registration prior to production and use. Substances produced, used and processed on the territory of the Federation, as well as imported, prior to 31 March 1993 (``old substances''), are subject to mandatory State registration within three years from the time of publication of these instructions. Specific registration dates must be coordinated with agencies of State sanitary oversight before 1 July 1993. 2. Procedure for State Registration 2.1. Chemical and biological substances (compounds) are registered when submitted by ministries, agencies, enterprises, organizations, institutions, other juridical entities, as well as individuals responsible for production and import of a given substance (compound), regardless of forms of ownership. 2.2. The registration process includes receiving applications, examining them and making the decision to register, and issuing a registration certificate. 2.3. The ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' which is filled out by the applicant who is responsible for accuracy of furnished data, is the basis for registration. 2.4. Substances for which complete information could not be submitted at the time of registration, but the properties and area of application of which warrant belief that its hazard to man and the environment is immaterial, are subject to registration for a term of 3 years with assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificated with annotation of the 3-year validity. Fullness (or lack of necessity to submit data for some parameter or other) of submitted information is determined in each specific instance by the Register in accordance with existing standard-setting and methodological documentation. If an applicant does not submit the necessary information within 3 years, as stipulated in the certificate, the registration certificate is no longer valid. 2.5. In the Register, there is a permanent group of experts, which is confirmed following established procedure, representing institutions of the Goskomsanepidnadzor of the Ministry of Environmental Protection examines the most difficult cases related to making decisions on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.6. Assignment to a chemical and biological substance of a State registration number and issuance of a registration certificate confirm the adequacy and quality of ecotoxicological and other parameters, and serve as grounds to enter them in standards and specifications documentation (NTD, such as GOST, TU and others) in the sections \"Safety requirements\" and ``Environmental protection.'' 2.7. The finding as to conformity of specific production and use conditions for a substance with a State registration number to environmental protective and sanitary rules, adequacy of methods of assaying substances and conformity to NTD (GOST, TU, and others), as well as hygienic certification, are implemented by agencies of State sanitary and epidemiological oversight and Ministry Environmental Protection of the Federation in accordance with sanitary and environment protective legislation. 2.8. Assignment of a State registration number and issuance of registration certificate are implemented on the basis of the expert finding of the Register's specialists and its approval by the director of the Register. 2.9. When registering a substance, the applicant remits payment in advance to the Register in accordance with the Statute approved by Decree No 552 of the Federation Government dated 5 Aug 92, as well as for upgrading performance and material-technical support of the system of State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances. 2.10. Applications for State registration are addressed in the name of the Register's director at 101479 Moscow, Vadkovskiy Lane, 18-20. 2.11. Documentation for registration must include: 2.11.1. a referral (cover letter) signed by an enterprise administrator or individual entrepreneur; 2.11.2. filled out ``List of information needed for State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances'' (Appendix 1); 2.11.3. materials, on the basis which the ``List of information....'' was filled out; 2.11.4. payment authorization to pay for the registration fee; 2.11.5. official conclusion of the applicant as to possible publication of State registration materials in the free press. 2.12. Registration materials are to be examined within 30 days. After assignment of a registration number, the Register issues a certificate of State registration of the established specimen (Appendix 2) andinformation form (Appendix 3) to the applicant, and publishesinformation about registration in the Register's information bulletin. 2.13. Validity of a registration certificate can be suspended by the Register if new data are received concerning previously unknown hazardous properties of a substance. The Register notifies the applicant of suspension of the registration certificate and/or ban on the substance within 10 days of making this decision, and publishes this information in the Register's information bulletin. 2.14. The Register guarantees confidentiality of information about a substance that is an industrial secret unless it poses a threat to humanhealth and environmental safety. 2.15. The Register may, under specific conditions, rightfully refuse to issue a registration certificate. 2.16. An appeal of the Register's decision must be filed, no later than 30 days after it is made, with the chairman of the Goskomsanepidnadzor. The appeal is examined within 30 days. The decision of the chairman of the Goskomsanepidnadzor may be appealed in Arbitration Court. 2.17. Enterprises and other business entities, regardless of the agency to which they pertain and form of ownership, organizations and institutions situated on the territory of the Federation, individuals carrying out development, production and use, export and import of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances bear responsibility in accordance with the ``Statute on State registration of potentially hazardous chemical and biological substances,'' approved by Decree No 869 of the Federation Government dated 12 November 1992.

Aniline is the fourth highest-volume reactant used in the dye industry, according to data provided in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaires, with a 1991 use volume of 4860 metric tons. Based on the aniline concentrations found in the waste, the Agency has calculated a high-end individual cancer-risk level for this constituent at 1E&hyph;5. Aniline was found in over 70% of the samples of wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye production. However, 11 of the 13 aniline data points, which were all from one facility, were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the facility reported that aniline found in the wastewater treatment sludges is associated with non-dye operations. This facility consumes larger volumes of aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of azo dyes. It is likely that aniline from dye operations contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste; however, the Agency could not determine the extent of this contribution. In studying the wastewater treatment systems from azo dye manufacturing operations as a whole, the Agency found aniline to be present in all systems from which samples were collected. In addition, aniline was consistently present in the wastewaters for all samples collected. Furthermore, even though aniline would be expected to biodegrade in the wastewater treatment system, aniline was present in 2 out of 5 samples from the wastewater treatment sludge. Because the wastewater treatment sludge presents a complex matrix for chemical analysis, the detection limits obtained for the wastewater treatment sludges were high. Therefore, the Agency believes that, given the consistent presence of aniline in the wastewater, and the detection of aniline in 2 out of 5 sludge samples (with 11 data points dropped for the reasons stated earlier), aniline typically is present in wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing operations. Based on the aniline concentrations found in the two data points that remain after 11 data points were dropped, the Agency has determined that the risk posed by aniline in this wastestream is significant. An additional high-volume raw material used in the manufacture of azo dyes, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, was found to be present in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that result in calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level of 2E&hyph;5. Based on data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, 1719 metric tons of 3,3'-dimethyoxybenzidine were used in the manufacture of azo dyes in 1991. In addition to the risks posed by the individual hazardous constituents found in the waste, some of the contaminants are co-occurring in this wastestream. The Agency found that sludge samples collected from each of the four azo dye manufacturing facilities generally contain one or more toxic raw materials simultaneously. Therefore, some individual carcinogens are co-occurring in the waste and the calculated risks are assumed to be additive. Given the waste characterization and risk assessment results, along with toxicity information on other raw materials used in the production of azo dyes ( i.e. , aromatic amines), the Agency believes that wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing typically contain one or more toxic raw materials at concentrations that pose a significant risk. In addition to the azo dye raw materials that were found in the wastestream at concentrations that pose a high risk, two additional constituents, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, and the two coeluting compounds diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine, were found in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that pose carcinogenic risks above 1E&hyph;6 (See Section II.D for treatment of coeluting compounds). The results from the assessment of exposure pathways other than drinking contaminated ground water resulting from management in an on-site monofill also are presented in Table II&hyph;6. Calculated high-end individual cancer-risk levels between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 were identified for six contaminants through indirect exposure pathways (contaminated vegetable ingestion) if airborne dusts are not controlled. In addition to the risks posed by the monofill management practice, the calculated risk posed by municipal landfill disposal also is within EPA's range of potential concern, 1E&hyph;6 to 1E&hyph;4, for two sets of coeluting compounds, 2- and 4-aminoaniline/2-methoxyaniline, and 2- and 4-aminotoluene. The Agency also considered the risks posed by these contaminants for a municipal landfill when making the listing decision. Based on an analysis of the risks associated with the current management practices, a monofill and municipal landfill, EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K164. For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, aniline, diphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, 4-methylphenol, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitrophenol, 2-aminotoluene, and 4-aminotoluene. In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 4-methylphenol, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, and 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents. b. Wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants (K165). Summary The Agency is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&C colorants, as hazardous. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated a high-end individual risk level of 1E&hyph;4 for one hazardous constituent for the plausible management scenario, treatment in an unlined surface impoundment. Two additional constituents are estimated to pose risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 for the surface impoundment scenario. Discussion Based on response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, the volume reported by the industry for wastewaters from azo dye production, excluding FD&C colorants, was 6,295,779 metric tons per year, or 4.6 million gallons per day. Approximately 58% of wastewaters from azo dye production, excluding FD&C colorants currently are pretreated and discharged to a POTW. Over 40% of these wastewaters are treated in aerobic biological tank systems, with subsequent NPDES discharge to a surface water. Approximately 5% of the wastewaters from azo dye operations excluding FD&C colorants are treated in biological treatment systems that use surface impoundments.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00051", "score": 6.956600189208984}, {"content": "Title: Content: NRC held rulemaking workshops in Chicago, IL; San Francisco, CA; Boston, MA; Dallas, TX; Philadelphia, PA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC between January and May 1993. The workshop comments have been summarized in NUREG/CR&hyph;6156, ``Summary of Comments Received from Workshops on Radiation Criteria for Decommissioning.'' This report summarizes 3,635 comments categorized from transcripts of the seven workshops and 1,677 comments from 100 NRC docketed letters from individuals and organizations. NUREG/CR&hyph;6156 merely catalogues the comments and viewpoints; no analysis or response to the comments is included. The comments reflect a broad spectrum of viewpoints on the issues related to radiological criteria for decommissioning and associated subjects. The comments show little evidence of general agreement on issues except that most parties appear to agree that (1) the rulemaking should proceed and (2) the Commission's activities in decommissioning should recognize that it is not reasonable to expect all nuclear facilities to be remediated to a level that permits termination of the license and release of the facility for unrestricted use. While a number of additional themes emerged from the workshops, these themes cannot be characterized as having the general agreement of all of the workshop and meeting participants. Transcripts of the workshops and scoping meetings and copies of related letters are available for inspection or copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW (Lower Level), Washington, DC. The NRC also held public meetings on the scope of the GEIS during July 1993 in Washington, DC; San Francisco, CA; Oklahoma City, OK; and Cleveland, OH. Comments from these meetings were reviewed and comments which differed substantially from those from the workshops are also summarized in the body of NUREG/CR&hyph;6156. A summary of all of the comments from the GEIS scoping meetings is included as Appendix E to the GEIS. Summary and Discussion of Comments 1. Need For and Scope of Rule Comment. Almost all commenters supported the NRC's plans to develop radiological decommissioning standards and recommended that the rulemaking go forward expeditiously. Some commenters recommended that the NRC consider and possibly establish both radiological and chemical decommissioning standards. Most commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites. Response. The NRC is proceeding with a rulemaking which will establish radiological criteria for decommissioning. NRC's schedule calls for issuance of a final rule by May 1995. NRC's authority is limited by law primarily to ensuring protection of the public health and safety from radiological and nuclear hazards associated with source, special nuclear, and byproduct material. NRC has refrained from extending its reach to address non-radiological hazards except where specifically authorized by Congress (e.g., uranium mill tailings) or where these hazards would not otherwise be adequately controlled because of a regulatory void. Consequently, NRC is not proposing to include provisions in the radiological criteria to address non-radiological hazards. Although the rule would not establish criteria for disposition of nonradioactive hazardous and other wastes, licensees are reminded that they must continue to meet applicable Federal, State, and local standards for disposition of these wastes. The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license. If a licensee cannot satisfy the conditions for license termination, the license will not be terminated. 2. Basis for Radiological Criteria Comment. Several commenters recommended that NRC decommissioning standards be based on and be consistent with the scientific information and advice of such organizations as the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). One commenter suggested that the NRC should determine whether the standards are to be technologically-based or politically-based; if the latter, do not waste time on technological input. Response. It should be noted that the NRC and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, have generally followed the basic radiation protection recommendations of the ICRP; its U.S. counterpart, the NCRP; and the EPA Draft Federal Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure to the General public in formulating basic radiation protection standards. Recommendations of the ICRP and the NCRP were relied on in the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' which was published May 21, 1991 (56 FR 233360), and implemented by licensees on or before January 1, 1994. The proposed radiological criteria for decommissioning continues this practice but the proposed rule also recognizes the public's interest in and potential for contributing to the decommissioning process. The public's involvement through participating in the development of the criteria in this rulemaking, opportunities for review of decommissioning plans, as well as through participation on Site-Specific Advisory Boards as specified in this rule are expected to aid in the conduct of a decommissioning program that is understandable, technologically sound, and responsive to the concerns of affected parties. Comment. Several commenters recommended that the NRC consider adopting a risk limit standard equating to a radiation dose of 25 to 100 millirem per year. According to two commenters, a 100 millirem per year limit would increase the cancer risk in the population only slightly above its normal incidence rate. One commenter believes that radiation damage per unit of exposure may increase at smaller doses. Other commenters stated that there may be a threshold for radiation effects and that there may be no adverse health effects at low radiation levels. Response. In the Supplementary Information for the revised ``Standards for Protection Against Radiation,'' the NRC stated that the standards are based upon the assumptions that: (1) Within the range of exposure conditions usually encountered in radiation work, there is a linear relationship, without threshold, between dose and probability of occurrence of stochastic (random) health effects such as latent cancer and genetic effects; (2) The severity of each type of stochastic health effect is independent of dose; and (3) Nonstochastic (nonrandom) radiation-induced health effects can be prevented by limiting exposures so that doses are below the thresholds for their induction.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940822-1-00023", "score": 6.95550012588501}, {"content": "Title: Content: This change alters the assumptions of the safety analysis for the Small-Break Loss of Coolant Accident, the Steam Generator Tube Rupture and the Loss of Normal Feedwater due to their dependence on the AFW system to start and supply AFW flow for heat removal. To support this change the Westinghouse Electric Corporation has performed an analysis of the Small-Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident using the NOTRUMP code assuming ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. This analysis resulted in a Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) of 1053 &cir;F from an initial power level of 100%. All other acceptance criteria of 10 CFR 50.46 were [also] met. This large margin to the 2200 &cir;F PCT limit supports ten minutes for operator action to initiate auxiliary feedwater. Furthermore, WPSC has analyzed the Loss of Normal Feedwater and the Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident assuming delays in the initiation of auxiliary feedwater. The Loss of Normal Feedwater Accident with a ten minute delay in the initiation of Auxiliary Feedwater does not result in any adverse condition in the core. It does not result in water relief from the pressurizer safety valves, nor does it result in uncovering the tube sheets of the steam generators. Also, at all times the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio (DNBR) remained greater than 1.30. The Steam Generator Tube Rupture Accident with no Auxiliary Feedwater flow was also analyzed. The results of this analysis indicate that neither steam generator empties of liquid and at least 20 &cir;F of reactor coolant system subcooling is maintained throughout the transient. Also, there is no increase in the radiological dose to the public. For these reasons, these changes will not adversely effect the health and safety of the public or involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Significant Hazards Determination for Proposed Administrative Changes to Section TS 3.4 ``Steam and Power Conversion System'' The proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards exist. The proposed changes will not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent or interpretation of the TS. Therefore, no significant hazards exist. Additionally, the proposed change is similar to example C.2.e(i) in 51 FR 7751. Example C.2.e.(i) states that changes which are purely administrative in nature; i.e., to achieve consistency throughout the Technical Specifications, correct an error, or a change in nomenclature, are not likely to involve a significant hazard. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

But government officials said that finding represents an exaggerated picture of the state's performance, noting that the chemical principally responsible for the state's poor showing is no longer regarded by the Environmental Protection Agency as toxic. If that chemical -- sodium sulfate -- were excluded from the government assessment, the state's emissions of toxic substances would rank ninth in the nation, well behind Texas and Louisiana, which then would head the list. 26% of U.S. Total The assessment is contained in a government report that seeks for the first time to provide a national inventory of more than 300 cancer-causing and other hazardous chemicals released by manufacturing facilities into the air, land and water. Of 22.6 billion pounds of toxic chemicals emitted into the environment in 1987, California was responsible for 5.8 billion pounds -- about 26% of the national total, the report showed. But about 90% of the state's total derived from a Central California plant's vast emission of sodium sulfate, which was removed last week from the government's most-hazardous list because of its apparent lack of toxicity. The facility, a Kerr-McGee chemical plant in Trona, Calif., 180 miles northeast of Los Angeles, takes sodium sulfate from dry Searles Lake and uses it in the production of a variety of products, including potash and soda ash. Among the products is sodium sulfate itself, which is known as salt cake and used in detergents and the paper-pulping process. But most of the chemical, about 3.7 billion pounds, is discharged into surface water each year, while an additional 1.5 billion pounds is injected into underground wells. Sodium sulfate was included in a list of more than 300 toxic chemicals that Congress required industry to monitor closely under a 1986 law. But senior EPA officials said Monday that they believe listing the chemical as toxic was a mistake by lawmakers. 'Basically Innocent' \"We think sodium sulfate is basically innocent,\" Charles Elkins, director of the agency's toxics program, told reporters at a briefing. Other toxic pollutants released in greater volumes in California than in most other states included toluene, arsenic, lead and lead compounds and a variety of pesticides. Separate EPA estimates of toxic emissions into land, air and water across the county had already been made public. But the release of the comprehensive \"toxics release inventory\" Monday marked the first time that the agency had analyzed many of its findings by geographical region. The survey will be released publicly through a new computer database maintained by the National Library of Medicine. Under the program, individuals can use library facilities to obtain information about toxic pollutants released at facilities near them. Among the available information will be estimates of the volume of toxins released at each site and an explanation of the health hazards each chemical may pose. No official assessment will be made of the health risk posed by toxic releases at individual industrial sites, even though preliminary EPA studies have identified more than 200 sites believed to pose a particularly high risk of cancer. Agency officials emphasized Monday that such studies are not final but said that they believe it important for the raw information about toxic emissions to be made public. The new database, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said, is a \"breakthrough that will facilitate citizen involvement in assessing the risks of toxic chemicals and developing community strategies to prevent pollution.\" Meanwhile, a separate list of major toxic polluters, based on EPA data and released by a leading environmental group Monday, lists a Compton plant among the nation's 30-largest sources of cancer-causing air pollutants by volume. In 1987, the Crain Industries facility released more than 1 million pounds of methylene chloride, according to the report by the Natural Resources Defense Council. The chemical, a solvent used as a paint remover, is classified by the EPA as a \"probable human carcinogen.\" Officials at Crain could not be reached for comment Monday on the report. By comparison, the nation's top-ranking producer of toxic air pollutants -- an Eastman Kodak Co. facility in Rochester, N.Y. -- emitted nearly 9 million tons of methylene chloride that year, according to the report. The National Resources report is based on industry reports to the EPA. An earlier list of polluters, drawn from preliminary EPA data based on health risks from certain chemicals, included several Southern California facilities but not the Crain Industries plant.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA062089-0066", "score": 6.916800022125244}, {"content": "Title: Content: May 25, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition FIRM FINED $450,000 FOR MISHANDLING OF ASBESTOS A Los Angeles development company was fined $450,000 Thursday for violating hazardous waste regulations in connection with the improper disposal of asbestos during demolition of an Atwater Village pottery factory, authorities said. Perlita in L.A. Inc. pleaded no contest to one count of illegal disposal of hazardous waste during an arraignment hearing in Los Angeles County Municipal Court, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert M. Brodney. The West Los Angeles company, one of its site supervisors and two contractors were charged last month with allowing friable asbestos -- crumbly material that could release airborne particles -- to escape in December, 1988, when they demolished kilns and factory structures at the defunct Franciscan Ceramics plant. The structures at 2901 Los Feliz Blvd. were being demolished in preparation for development of the 45-acre site. Under a plea agreement with prosecutors, Perlita, in addition to the fine, was placed on three years probation by Municipal Judge Candace Beason, Brodney said. Environmental regulations allow for corporate violators to be charged as if they were an individual person. \"You can't put a corporation in jail,\" Brodney said. \"They are paying a fine. $450,000 is a substantial fine.\" Brodney said other companies in Los Angeles County have been fined $600,000 or more for similar violations. Brodney said Perlita is also cleaning up the ceramics plant site and has already paid $150,000 to clean bricks that were taken from the kilns and transported to a brick-crushing plant in Barstow. At the arraignment hearing Thursday, Pradeep Agnihotri of El Toro, John Edwards of Arcadia and Al Sesar of Newport Beach pleaded innocent to two counts each of illegal disposal and transportation of hazardous waste. Agnihotri, 33, was the site manager for Perlita, and Edwards, 52, operated a company that demolished the kiln structures, authorities said. The debris was trucked to Barstow by a company operated by the 37-year-old Sesar. Brodney said the kiln structures contained powdered asbestos insulation that should have been vacuumed out and bagged in accordance with health regulations. \"They should have known those kilns had asbestos in them,\" Brodney said. \"They just knocked them down, scooped it all up and put it in trucks, and it was taken to San Bernardino for recycling.\" Brodney said if the asbestos had not been discovered by health inspectors shortly after the demolition, the contaminated bricks would have been crushed and the material then possibly used to make roof tiles. Though the kilns were torn down during two weeks of heavy Santa Ana wind activity in the area, health authorities who later tested air quality near the site could not determine if any of the asbestos became airborne during the demolition, Brodney said. Perlita in L.A. is the corporate name for the Franciscan Promenade partnership, which is completing cleanup of the property before development, officials said.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA052590-0020", "score": 6.905600070953369}, {"content": "Title: Content: 5. Neurotoxicology Risk Assessment 5.1. Introduction Risk assessment is an empirically based process used to estimate the risk that exposure of an individual or population to a chemical, physical, or biological agent will be associated with an adverse effect. Generally, such effects can be quantified and the relative probability of their occurrence can be calculated. The risk assessment process usually involves four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization (NRC, 1983). Risk management is the process that applies information obtained through the risk assessment process to determine whether the assessed risk should be reduced and, if so, to what extent (NRC, 1983). In some cases, risk is the only factor considered in a decision to regulate exposure to a substance. Alternatively, the risk posed by a substance is weighed against social, ethical, and medical benefits and economic and technological factors in formulating a risk management decision. The risk- balancing approach is used by some agencies to consider the benefits as well as the risks associated with unrestricted or partially restricted use of a substance. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the risk assessment process as it has currently evolved in neurotoxicology and present available options for quantitative risk assessment. 5.2. The Risk Assessment Process 5.2.1. Hazard Identification Agents that adversely affect the neurophysiological, neurochemical, or structural integrity of the nervous system or the integration of nervous system function expressed as modified behavior may be classified as neurotoxicants (Tilson, 1990b). For hazard identification, the best or most generalizable studies would measure these changes in humans. With the exclusion of therapeutic agents, information on effects in humans is usually derived from case reports of accidental exposures and epidemiological studies. This type of data affords less certainty regarding generalizability as well as less specific exposure information. As discussed in chapter 4, a common alternative method of data generation for hazard identification is the use of animal models. Animal models that measure behavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, and structural effects have been developed and validated. Studies that employ these models to evaluate specific potential hazards are used to predict the outcome of exposure to the same hazard in humans. 5.2.1.1. Human studies Information obtained through the evaluation of human exposure data provides direct identification of neurotoxic hazards. This type of information is generally available from clinical trials required for the approval of therapeutic products for human use. For the purposes of risk assessment of nontherapeutic substances, data on effects of exposure to humans come primarily from two types of studies, case reports and epidemiological (Friedlander and Hearn, 1980) (see chapter 3). Case studies can supply evidence of an agent's toxicity, but are often limited by both the qualitative nature of the signs and symptoms reported and the nature of the exposure data. Epidemiological studies can provide data on the types of neurotoxic effects and the possible susceptibilities of certain populations. Under appropriate considerations, they can generally provide convincing and reliable evidence of potential human neurotoxicity. As with case studies, however, often only qualitative estimates of exposure can be obtained. Controlled laboratory studies have the potential to provide adequate exposure and effects data for accurate hazard identification, but ethical considerations place moral and practical restrictions on such studies except in those instances where direct benefit to the subjects, as in the case of therapeutic agents, may be expected. Excluding instances of therapeutic product development, most studies are limited to measuring the effects of acute, rather than long-term, exposure. This limits their utility in risk assessment because the effect of long-term, low-level exposure to a potentially toxic agent is often the issue of concern. Methods available to evaluate neurotoxicity in humans include examination of neurophysiological and behavioral parameters. Specific tests to measure neuromuscular strength and coordination, alterations in sensation, deficits in learning and memory, changes in mood and personality, and disruptions of autonomic function are frequently employed (see chapter 3). 5.2.1.2. Animal studies As discussed in chapter 4, animal models for many endpoints of neurotoxicity are available and widely used for hazard identification. Data from animal studies are frequently extrapolated to humans. For example, if exposure to an agent produces neuropathology in an animal model, damage to a comparable structure in humans is predicted. Similarly, biochemical and physiological effects observed in animals are commonly extrapolated to humans. Agents that produce alterations in the levels of specific enzymes in one animal species generally have the same effect in other species, including humans. Neurophysiological endpoints also tend to be affected by the same manipulations across species. Thus, an agent interfering with nerve conduction in an animal study is often assumed to have the same effect in humans. Behavioral studies in animals are also applied to human hazard identification, although the correspondence between methods employed in animals and humans is sometimes not as obvious. For this reason, behavioral methods developed for neurotoxic hazard identification need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. 5.2.1.3. Special issues 5.2.1.3.1. Animal-to-human extrapolation. The use of animal data to identify hazard to humans is not without controversy. Relative sensitivity across species as well as between sexes is a constant concern. Overly conservative risk assessments, based on the assumption that humans are always more sensitive than a tested animal species, can result in poor risk management decisions. Conversely, an assumption of equivalent sensitivity in a case where humans actually are more sensitive to a given agent can result in underregulation that might have a negative impact on human health. 5.2.1.3.2. Susceptible populations. A related controversy concerns the use of data collected from adult organisms, animal or human, to predict hazards in potentially more sensitive populations, such as the very young and the elderly, or in other groups, such as the chronically ill. In some cases, identification of neurotoxicity hazard does not generally include subjects from either end of the human life span or from other than healthy subjects. Uncertainty factors are used to adjust for more sensitive populations. In addition, single or multigeneration reproductive studies in animals may provide a source of information on neurological disorders, behavioral changes, autonomical dysfunction, neuroanatomical anomalies, and other signs of neurotoxicity in the developing animal (chapter 4). 5.2.1.3.3. Reversibility. For the most part, the basic principles of hazard identification are the same for neurotoxicity as for any adverse effect on health. One notable exception, however, concerns the issue of reversibility and the special consideration that must be given to the inherent redundancy and plasticity of the nervous system. For many health effects, temporary, as opposed to permanent, effects are repaired during a true recovery. Damage to many organ systems, if not severe, can be spontaneously repaired. For example, damaged liver cells that may result in impaired liver function often can be replaced with new cells that function normally. The resulting restoration of liver function can be viewed as recovery. In the central nervous system, cells generally do not recover from severe damage and new cells do not replace them. When nervous system recovery is observed, it may represent compensation requiring activation of cells that were previously performing some other function, reactive synaptogenesis, or recovery of moderately injured cells. While a damaged liver may recover due to the addition of new cells, severe damage to nervous system cells results in a net loss of cells. This loss of compensatory capacity may not be noticed for many years and, when it does appear, it may be manifest in a way seemingly unrelated to the original neurotoxic event. Lack of ability to recover from a neurotoxic event later in life or premature onset of signs of normal aging may result. It is therefore important to consider the possibility that significant damage to the nervous system may have occurred in experiments where effects appear to be reversible.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940817-2-00263", "score": 6.889400005340576}, {"content": "Title: Content: BFN Manila, May 30 (XINHUA) -- One health official and four organizations including two from China were chosen to be bestowed with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 1994 Tobacco or Health Award for their continuing effort and support in fighting tobacco.

PURPOSE: Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles. Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. The availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of citizens of certain affected areas to provide consensus advice to CDC and ATSDR regarding these activities is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The purpose of this workshop is to provide interested parties an opportunity to give individual advice and recommendations regarding: (1) Community involvement between representatives of affected populations, Native American Nations, and CDC and ATSDR; (2) the principles and process of public involvement given the diversities of interests and needs of affected and potentially affected populations and Native American Nations; (3) the concerns and needs which may be common to all; and, (4) provide a public forum for citizens of affected populations.

ACTION: Publication of a request for pre-proposals and correction of deadline for receipt of pre-proposals. SUMMARY: On August 31, 1994 (59 FR 44985), EPA published a notice, signed by the acting Assistant Administrator for Research and Development, announcing the availability of a document requesting pre-proposals from Minority Academic Institutions (MAIs) for participation in the Hazardous Substance Research Centers (HSRCs) Program. EPA has corrected the deadline for submissions of pre-proposals from October 15 to October 21. For the convenience of the public, EPA is publishing the full text of the document in this notice. EPA will also continue to make the document available separately. The purpose of the request for pre-proposal is to set forth the eligibility and submission requirements, evaluation criteria and schedule for establishing hazardous substance research, technology transfer and training activities at MAIs, in cooperation with the five HSRCs, as authorized by section 311(d) of Superfund, and as amended by section 209 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988. These activities will be competitively awarded. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes that minority academic institutions (MAIs) are underrepresented in research and other activities relating to hazardous substance management. To improve this situation, EPA is making funds available to enhance the ability of MAIs to participate in research, technology transfer, training, and academic development activities in collaboration with EPA's five HSRCs. The program rationale and design, areas of interest, eligibility requirements, and other important information are described in the document, which is published in full under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . DATES: All pre-proposals must be received by October 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send pre-proposals to the appropriate contact points listed in Table 1 under SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dr. Dale Manty, Director, Hazardous Substance Research Centers Program, Office of Exploratory Research (8703), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460 (202&hyph;260&hyph;7454). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Program Announcement and Solicitation for Minority Academic Institution (MAI) Participation in Hazardous Substance Research Centers (HSRC) Program; Pre-proposal for MAI Participation in the HSRC Program The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is concerned that minority academic institutions (MAIs) are underrepresented in research and other activities relating to hazardous substance management. To improve this situation, EPA announces the availability of funds to enhance the ability of MAIs to participate in research, technology transfer, training, and academic development activities in collaboration with EPA's five University Hazardous Substance Research Centers (HSRCs). The program rationale and design, areas of interest, eligibility requirements, and other important information are described below. The process begins with submission of an original and eight copies of pre-proposals from MAIs to one of the five EPA HSRCs. An administrative review will be made by the Center Director, in consultation with the EPA National HSRC Program Director. Eligible applications will then be reviewed for relevance and quality by each Center's Director, Science Advisory Committee, and Technology Transfer and Training Advisory Committees. Successful applicants will be invited to submit full proposals. Hazardous Substance Problems One of the important environmental issues facing our civilization is the management of hazardous substances from manufacture to treatment and disposal. Since 1980, over 40,000 hazardous waste sites have been discovered, more than 1,000,000 underground storage tanks are estimated to be leaking, and more than 250,000 industrial and waste storage or treatment facilities are subject to permit requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. A National Priorities List for cleanup of the worst of these sites has been established by EPA. This list, plus similar state lists, total more than 5,000 sites. Such sites are causing contamination of air, soil, and ground and surface water. There is a growing recognition of the risks such contamination inflicts upon ecological communities. Conventional methods of determining, cleaning up, and managing these problems are proving inadequate to achieve desired levels of clean-up. The HSRC Program is fueled by a strong desire to develop better, cheaper, faster, and safer methods to assess and clean up these sites. EPA priorities for addressing these problems include development of new methods to assess and remediate sites, decrease the production and use of hazardous substances, and train a new generation of hazardous substance managers. General Description Under Section 311(d) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9660(d), EPA has established five Hazardous Substance Research Centers. In 1994, Congress provided EPA with funds to encourage MAIs to participate in the HSRCs' research and training and technology transfer activities. These funds will be provided through a Federal Assistance Agreement with each HSRC, which in turn will establish sub-contracts with MAIs. If additional funds become available, additional qualified applicants may be funded. The MAI is expected to contribute a 20% match of non-federal resources. These resources may come from State, local, foundation, individual, or private sector contributions and may include in-kind contributions. No Federal funds provided for this program may be used to purchase, build, or renovate any buildings or to purchase land. Up to 15% of the funds will be available to encourage HSRC researchers to collaborate in joint projects with MAI researchers. Hazardous Substance Research Center Program EPA has competitively established five Hazardous Substance Research Centers to provide: \u2022Short- and long-term research on the manufacture, disposal, clean-up, and management of hazardous substances; \u2022Dissemination of research information and findings; and \u2022Training, technology transfer, and technical outreach and support to benefit organizations, communities, and individuals involved with hazardous substances. Research supported by the HSRCs covers all relevant scientific and technological subjects except human health effects research (toxicology, dose-response epidemiology, etc.). Each HSRC is headed by a Center Director who is responsible for managing each Center. The Director is the intellectual leader and guide for the Center. A Technology Transfer and Training Director oversees training and commercial application of Center projects. Each of the five HSRCs serves the States within two adjoining pairs of Federal Regions. All five collaborate to form a National Hazardous Substance Research Centers Program. Each center has its own Science Advisory Committee and Technology Transfer and Training Advisory Committee which regularly review the progress of ongoing work and recommend funding of new proposals.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940920-2-00045", "score": 6.82390022277832}, {"content": "Title: Content: April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition EPA CALLS FOR RADON TESTING IN U.S. SCHOOLS Sounding a new alarm about indoor air pollution, the Environmental Protection Agency warned Thursday that unhealthy levels of radon have been detected in the nation's schools and urged officials nationwide to test schoolrooms for possible contamination by the cancer-causing gas. The extraordinary health alert, issued by EPA Administrator William K. Reilly, was based on preliminary results of an agency survey that found hazardous levels of radioactive radon in more than half of the 130 schools tested in 16 states. California's top public health official, reacting angrily to the sweeping directive, contended that the recommendations could create \"unfounded fear and anxiety\" in the state, where previous studies have indicated that radon is not a major public health concern. State Not Included Kenneth W. Kizer, director of the state Department of Health Services, noted in a letter to Riley that the EPA study did not include any California schools and that the state's own survey of 29 schools had not found any hazardous levels of the gas. State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Thursday that he sees no reason for alarm in California. Based on information provided to the state Department of Education by the EPA and the state Department of Health Services last fall, Honig said, school districts were advised that there was \"little likelihood that radon was a problem\" in most of the state's public schools. However, because of the latest EPA warning, Honig said he soon will be sending a letter to school districts \"outlining the conditions under which schools may be exposed to elevated levels of radon\" and providing guidelines for further study. The Los Angeles Unified School District began testing schools for radon in January, chief safety officer Susie Wong said. The district placed 300 detectors in classrooms in 80 schools. The detectors were collected Thursday and will be sent to a laboratory today for analysis. The results are expected in May. \"We did our testing to find out what kinds of levels our kids are being exposed to,\" Wong said. \"We hope it's not a problem, but we want to confirm that it isn't.\" The stern EPA warning reaffirmed a statement released by the agency last autumn, when it joined Surgeon General C. Everett Koop in issuing a health advisory exhorting homeowners across the nation to test their residences for radon. Far too few individuals have heeded that advice, Reilly declared. He said the survey of schools raises new concerns about the danger radon poses to children, who are believed to be particularly susceptible to the ill effects of the radioactive gas. In making the health advisory public, Reilly acknowledged that it was based on preliminary and incomplete research. But he emphasized that the data collected was so troublesome and the risks so severe that remedial efforts should not be delayed until a more comprehensive survey is completed. \"The risks posed by radon gas are very real,\" Reilly told the National Press Club. \"But with a little thoughtful effort, we can solve this problem with relative ease.\" Critics of the EPA's findings say they could grossly exaggerate actual radon levels because they are based on 24-hour monitoring even though radon levels ebb and flow throughout the year. Experts call radon the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the United States and blame it for 15,000 deaths a year. An odorless, colorless gas, radon is produced by the radioactive decay of uranium and seeps naturally from the soil. Although it usually escapes harmlessly into the environment, the gas can reach dangerously high concentrations when contained by man-made structures. The severity of the radon threat varies geographically according to the uranium content of the soil. For example, the EPA estimates that radon levels exceed healthful limits in 10% to 15% of American households. But a Times survey last year indicated that radon levels exceed healthful limits in only about 1.2% of Southern California homes. In the EPA survey, 54% of schools tested -- and at least one in each of the 16 states -- was found to contain one or more rooms in which radon levels exceeded the EPA limit of four picocuries per liter. Exposure to that concentration of radon is believed to pose a cancer risk equal to that of smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day. The highest reading, in a Tennessee school, was 136 picocuries -- an exposure equivalent to that of a four-pack-a-day smoker. Such health hazards, Reilly said, are \"significantly higher\" than the risks that the agency usually addresses in regulating such substances as pesticides. Children are believed to face an even higher risk of exposure to radon than do adults because of their small lung capacity and high breathing rates, according to an EPA report. And because of their youth, radiation-induced cancer can develop over many years. The EPA recommendation calls on schools to test all frequently used rooms on basement and ground-level floors, where radon most often accumulates. The agency recommended that the testing be conducted during cooler months, when doors and windows are more likely to be closed, allowing radon to accumulate more easily. No federal funding is to be provided for the recommended radon testing, which Reilly estimated would cost a \"few hundred dollars\" per school site. Only limited federal resources are available for schools seeking to eliminate radon contamination, a process that usually involves improving ventilation to allow the gas to dissipate more quickly. In a statement critical of the EPA recommendations, California health director Kizer declared that \"testing every classroom in this state would be a marked waste of money.\" The state's survey, which took 373 samples from 29 schools in 19 counties, found radon concentrations to be below detectable limits in 59% of the samples collected. None of the schools exceeded the four picocurie limit. Although the EPA study did not include California schools, it did monitor six sites in Nevada. The highest radon measurements there were among the lowest in the nation, tied with Indiana and Kansas. The most hazardous radon levels were found in Tennessee, Washington, Montana and New Mexico. Times staff writers Noel K. Wilson in Sacramento and Elaine Woo in Los Angeles contributed to this article. RADON IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS The California Department of Health Services tested for radon levels in 29 schools in 19 counties around the state. None of the samples exceeded 4 picocuries per liter, the level above which the federal Environmental Protection Agency recommends taking action. Below are the mean levels expressed in picocuries per liter found in schools in five Southern California counties. These readings are for a 24-hour period and do not necessarily represent actual year-around exposures.

Federal, state and Los Angeles County law enforcement officials announced Thursday the first federal felony indictment under an environmental law in a case involving the smuggling of toxic wastes from California into Mexico. Citing growing trafficking of hazardous garbage from California across the border, the officials also announced the creation of a new multi-agency task force intended to remove jurisdictional problems that have hampered such smuggling investigations in the past. \"There are a lot of types of crime that have gone global -- white collar crime, terrorism and drugs, just to name a few,\" said William Stollhans, assistant special agent in charge of enforcing environmental laws for the FBI. \"The indictment today is an example of where environmental crimes have now gone international. They know no international boundaries.\" The indictment charges that Raymond Franco, 57, a licensed waste hauler from El Toro, accepted money from California businesses to take their wastes to legal landfills or recycling facilities. But instead of going to the designated sites, the indictment says, Franco and an accomplice, David Torres, 39, of Huntington Park, loaded drums of the dangerous materials into enclosed trucks destined for Mexico, concealing the barrels under cardboard and wood and surrounding them with empty drums. Much of the dangerous material allegedly was dumped at a Tijuana warehouse owned by Torres, and investigators fear some of the barrels later may have been used by nearby residents to store water. Prosecutors said the government of Mexico cooperated fully in the inquiry. Among the firms whose waste ended up in Tijuana was Barmet Aluminum Corp. of Torrance, which paid Franco a total of $12,000 in 1988 to haul 57 drums of hazardous material to a treatment facility and a licensed hazardous-waste landfill, according to the indictment. Had the material actually gone to a legal landfill, the cost would have approached $28,000, more than twice as much as the firm paid Franco, investigators said. The division manager of the Torrance facility, which was not charged, said the company trusted Franco to dispose of the material lawfully. On Wednesday, The Times reported that increasingly strict environmental laws and the escalating costs of legal disposal are prodding more and more hazardous waste generators in Southern California to send their toxic garbage illegally into Mexico, where it is dumped or used in industrial processing. The indictment announced Thursday marked the first time transporters of hazardous waste have been charged with illegal smuggling under the U.S. Resource and Conservation Recovery Act, which prohibits, among other things, disposing of hazardous waste without a permit. In a similar case in 1986, three Americans were indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego for falsifying shipping documents. That case was filed under federal mail fraud statutes. \"This is the first time that California law enforcement officers have in fact witnessed the unlawful smuggling of toxic waste into Mexico and have documented it,\" said William Carter, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who helped investigate the case. \"This is just one set of players out of dozens who are out there operating in similar fashion. We just have to take them one set at a time.\" In a separate case stemming from the Franco investigation, the federal grand jury also indicted Laminating Co. of America, a Garden Grove firm, accusing it of conspiracy to dispose of and transport hazardous waste and 46 counts of illegal transportation and disposal of toxic waste -- all within Orange County. Rex Scatena, an attorney for Laminating, said the company is \"an old, family-run business.\" He said he had not yet seen the indictment, but he defended the firm. \"They have all the necessary permits to dispose of and handle the materials they use there,\" Scatena said. Franco, who authorities said disappeared from his Orange County home a year ago, was arrested in New York on Wednesday. He was arraigned before a federal magistrate in Brooklyn on Thursday and was held pending a bail hearing today. Authorities said they were planning to summon Torres to appear before a federal magistrate in Los Angeles. Torres is believed to be cooperating with investigators. Franco and Torres could not be reached for comment, but a woman who identified herself as Franco's wife said her husband is innocent. Reached by telephone at the couple's El Toro home, the sobbing woman said, \"He did nothing wrong. . . . He is a good person.\" Franco was charged with one count of conspiracy, seven counts of illegal transportation and disposal of hazardous waste and one count of illegal export of hazardous waste to Mexico. Torres was charged with one count of conspiracy, six counts of illegal transportation and disposal of hazardous waste and one count of illegal export of hazardous waste to Mexico. If convicted, Franco faces a maximum sentence of 32 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 on each count. Torres faces a maximum of 27 years in custody, and a fine of $250,000 for each count. Investigators said they placed Franco under surveillance in 1988 after he was identified as a possible suspect during routine monitoring by county health department officials of local waste generating companies. While under surveillance in October, 1988, Franco and Torres met at Laminating Co. of America in Garden Grove and loaded 16 drums of hazardous waste onto two trucks. Torres headed north in his truck but investigators lost track of him before he made any stops. The other truck, driven by a Mexican national, headed to the border, investigators said. The CHP stopped the vehicle before it reached the border and the driver was arrested and subsequently prosecuted by Orange County authorities for illegally transporting hazardous waste, according to Los Angeles County investigators. The man served jail time and eventually returned to Mexico. As undercover investigators continued to watch Franco, prosecutors said, they saw repeated illegal activities at Laminating Co. According to the indictment, the firm's employees were seen on several occasions illegally disposing of hazardous wastes in trash bins destined for a municipal landfill in the city of Orange. Franco also was seen dumping hazardous materials into an ordinary trash bin. The waste, eventually picked up by the municipal garbage company and taken to Santiago Landfill, should have been put into special containers and taken to a licensed hazardous waste facility. In the meantime, Barmet Aluminum Corp. notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that hazardous waste facilities where Franco and Torres were supposed to have taken Barmet's materials had not, in fact, received them. The corporation, based in Ohio, has aluminum recycling plants across the nation. \"The guy (Franco) did something wrong,\" said Jorge Eulloqui, division manager of the corporation's Torrance facility. \"We trusted him, we hired him under good conscience and he defrauded our company.\" Eulloqui, who said his plant budgets about $50,000 a year for the treatment, recycling and disposal of hazardous waste, said the company employee who contracted with Franco is no longer with the firm. Eulloqui said he does not believe that the former employee suspected anything was amiss even though the fees paid to Franco were unusually low for legal disposal. Los Angeles County and federal prosecutors, who announced the filing of the indictments at a news conference in Los Angeles, said they hope they will deter illegal dumping in the future. \"Companies realize it's cheaper to pollute than to dispose of hazardous material properly,\" said Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam B. Schiff, who is helping to prosecute the cases. \"We hope the announcement of the indictments and the task force will impress individuals that the calculus is changing dramatically, that the costs are going up dramatically.\" The new environmental task force will include representatives of the FBI, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Health Services. Officials said halting waste trafficking into Mexico will be a top priority of the task force, which will have jurisdiction over much of Southern California. Previously, law enforcement investigators told The Times that little was being done to stop toxic waste smugglers because of jurisdictional problems and lack of adequate staffing. Officials from the various agencies pledged Thursday to provide enough resources to give the task force muscle. \"We have to be as diligent at the border in stopping those poisons that are going south as we are in trying to stop the drugs that are coming north,\" said Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. \"In both cases, it comes back to haunt us.\" Reiner said crops imported from Mexico may be contaminated by toxic ground water and poisons that have been dumped in Mexican rivers. State officials also have worried that toxic waste dumped by Americans in Mexico is contributing to contamination in California. An internal state government memo obtained Thursday by The Times warned a year ago that the illegal disposal of hazardous waste in Mexico posed ground water contamination and air pollution threats not only to Mexico, but also to the United States. The May 30, 1989, memo to state Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer said the potential for environmental problems \"appears to be extreme,\" both from the illicit trafficking of hazardous waste into Mexico, and from waste generated in Mexico by American-owned factories along the border.

The definition of this term also indicates that grinding, drilling, abrasive blasting, and similar spark-producing operations are also considered to be hot work unless they are isolated from atmospheres containing a concentration of any flammable or combustible substance greater than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit of that substance. While the definition in the final rule is substantially the same as that contained in the proposed standard, it has been editorially revised for clarity. It should be noted that the definition of ``hot work'' in revised Subpart B will be applied to Subpart B whereas the definition of the same term in \u00a71915.4 applies to the rest of part 1915. ``Immediately dangerous to life or health'' 3 (IDLH) means an atmosphere that poses an immediate threat to life or that is likely to result in acute or immediate severe health effects. This definition has been adopted without substantive change from the proposal. 3 The definition of ``immediately dangerous to life or health'' in \u00a71910.146 reads as follows: Immediately dangerous to life or health (IDLH) means any condition that poses an immediate or delayed threat to life or that would cause irreversible adverse health effects or that would interfere with an individual's ability to escape unaided from a permit space. ``Inert or inerted atmosphere'' means an atmospheric condition in which: (1) The oxygen content of the atmosphere is maintained at a level less than or equal to 8 percent by volume or at a level of 50 percent of the amount required to support combustion, whichever is lower, or (2) The space is flooded with water and the vapor concentration of flammable or combustible materials in the free space above the water line is less than 10 percent of the lower explosive limit for the material. This definition has been adopted without substantive change from the proposal. In the NPRM, OSHA raised the issue of whether or not the proposed definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'' was appropriate, especially with respect to the maximum permissible level of oxygen. The Agency asked for guidance on whether or not specific oxygen levels for various substances should be published along with the rule. The persons who commented on this issue felt that OSHA should not publish specific levels in the final rule (Ex. 6&hyph;10, 6&hyph;18, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;27, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;33, 6&hyph;34). They argued that since a Marine Chemist would be the person authorizing and monitoring the inerting of atmospheres and since Marine Chemists are thoroughly familiar with the selection of appropriate procedures involved, specifying oxygen levels in the OSHA standard was unnecessary. Endorsing this view, NFPA (Ex. 6&hyph;10) stated: Inerting in the marine industry is overseen by Marine Chemists in accordance with the requirements of the ``Control of Gas Hazards on Vessels_NFPA 306 (1988).'' The provisions for inerting as contained in NFPA 306, 2&hyph;3.7(a), are based upon the industry accepted practice for inerting. It takes into account the theoretical lower limit for the amount of oxygen to support combustion, which is approximately 11% by volume for most petroleum products. The procedure specifies either reducing the oxygen content to 8% by volume or 50% of the amount to support combustion, whichever is less. In practice, because the value of 50% of the amount to support combustion is usually less than 8% by volume, an even greater margin of safety is achieved. The minimum oxygen for combustion values are contained in Appendix B, ``Explosion Prevention Systems_NFPA 69 (1986)''. NFPA 306 requires in 2&hyph;3.7(a), (c) that the selection and disposal of the inert gas medium be acceptable to the Marine Chemist who provides specific instructions on his/her Marine Chemist Certificate. NFPA supports the addition of the definition for inerting and the levels as specified in the definition since these levels are industry accepted and provide for an adequate level of safety when administered by a Marine Chemist in accordance with NFPA 306. The Marine Chemist Association, Inc. (Ex. 6&hyph;34), agreed stating: The Marine Chemist Association feels that inerting is not a procedure free of potential hazards and that inerting for hot work should only be attempted with the proper skill to determine each of the above mentioned factors. If OSHA provides only partial details of these factors, it may lead to unauthorized personnel attempting the procedure outside current regulatory requirement, and could possibly result in the generation of hazardous situations. For the reasons stated by NFPA and the Marine Chemist Association, OSHA is not specifying the precise levels of oxygen acceptable under the definition of ``inert or inerted atmosphere'', either directly in the definition or in an appendix. Under \u00a71915.14(a), an atmosphere to be inerted must be tested and certified by a Marine Chemist or a U.S. Coast Guard authorized person, who would be thoroughly familiar with the proper techniques involved. The Agency fully concurs with the Marine Chemist Association that setting out these levels within the standard itself might encourage unqualified persons to undertake the inerting of a hazardous atmosphere, possibly leading to a severe accident. ``Labeled'' means identified with a sign, placard, or other form of written communication that informs all employees of the status or condition of the work space to which it is attached. This term was not included in the proposed revision of Subpart B, but OSHA believes that its inclusion is necessary for clarity. ``Lower explosive limit'' (LEL) means the minimum concentration of vapor below which propagation of a flame does not occur in the presence of an ignition source.

Therefore, the EPA concluded that Options A and B are equally protective of human health and the environment (to the extent ascertainable by this modelling methodology). Historically under RCRA, the EPA has considered control option costs only to select between options estimated to achieve equivalent levels of protection. Therefore, to select between Options A and B, the EPA compared the estimated costs to implement each of the control options. Option B requires the use of air emission controls only on those TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers used to manage hazardous wastes with a volatile organic concentration at the point where the waste is generated equal to or greater than 100 ppmw. Because TSDF owners and operators would need to install and operate air emission controls on fewer TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers, Option B would be less expensive for the TSDF industry to implement than Option A. Therefore, the EPA selected Option B as the basis for the final rule. While Option B does not achieve the target MIR levels historically used for other promulgated RCRA rules, Option B does achieve substantial reductions in cancer risk. The annual cancer incidence is estimated to be reduced by greater than 95 percent from the baseline value. Furthermore, the MIR for most of the 2,300 TSDF nationwide are estimated to achieve the target MIR levels. To address the remaining cancer risk at TSDF after implementation of the air standards promulgated today, the EPA is further evaluating the waste management practices and the specific chemical compounds composing the organic emissions from those individual TSDF for which the MIR values are estimated to be greater than the historical RCRA target MIR levels. Following this evaluation, the EPA will determine what other actions, such as the use of section 3005(c)(3) omnibus permitting authority or additional rulemaking, are necessary to attain the health-based goals of RCRA section 3004(n).

Summary of Responses to Comments on Proposed Rule All of the comments on the proposed rule and the EPA's response to each of these comments is presented in ``Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDF)_Background Information for Promulgated Organic Air Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers'', EPA document number EPA&hyph;453/R&hyph;94&hyph;076b (to obtain a copy of this document refer to the ADDRESSES section of this preamble). The EPA's responses to topics addressed by many of the commenters are summarized below. A. Development of Air Standards Under RCRA Comment: Many comments were received regarding the extent to which the congressional directive of RCRA section 3004(n) should be implemented using air standards established by the EPA under Clean Air Act (CAA) authority. Commenters stated the position that protection of human health and the environment from TSDF air emissions is most appropriately, effectively, and efficiently addressed by developing air standards under the CAA authority. Therefore, commenters believe that the EPA should make the determination that the requirements of RCRA section 3004(n) are best fulfilled by deferring to air standards established under CAA authority. Commenters stated that the air standards proposed by the EPA under authority of RCRA section 3004(n) are: (1) Not needed because existing CAA programs adequately address the control of TSDF organic emissions; (2) Duplicative or contradictory of new programs now being implemented by the EPA to control hazardous air pollutants as directed by section 112 of the CAA; (3) Not in compliance with RCRA section 1006(b) regarding duplication or contradiction of CAA requirements; (4) Inconsistent with CAA programs that establish ozone precursor control requirements depending on the national ambient air quality standards attainment status of the region in which a source is located; (5) Inconsistent with the EPA's pollution prevention policy; (6) Contrary to the EPA's ``cluster concept'' of examining and coordinating regulations addressing the same emission source to minimize duplicative or contradictory requirements; and (7) Difficult to administer and enforce because, traditionally, one State regulatory agency administers rules regulating air emissions while another administers rules regulating hazardous waste management.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941206-0-00151", "score": 6.7758002281188965}, {"content": "Title: Content: May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition CLANDESTINE TOXIC WASTE EXPORTS TO MEXICO ON RISE A growing number of Southern California businesses are clandestinely trucking their hazardous wastes to Mexico to dodge increasingly stringent and costly environmental laws here, according to law enforcement investigators. Although there are few hard statistics to chronicle the illicit trafficking -- in large part because of spotty enforcement -- government officials as well as haulers and generators of the waste said they believe that the practice is on the upswing. William Carter, a Los Angeles County deputy district attorney who prosecutes environmental crimes, cites a \"big hole in enforcement.\" Reports of illegal waste shipments to Mexico come into his office about twice a week, indicating a \"steady stream\" of such shipments, he said. \"To some of the people who are involved, Mexico is one big trash can and it doesn't really matter what goes down there,\" Carter said. \"It's not realistic to think what we send down there won't come back in foods, water pollution, air pollution or pottery we buy from Mexico.\" Authorities predict the problem is only going to worsen. On Tuesday, a new federal rule was announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that is expected to make legal dumping even more costly. The rule, which was attacked by environmental groups as too weak, will require more kinds of hazardous wastes to be treated before they can be dumped in a landfill. A substance is considered hazardous if it poses a threat to humans or to the environment. By May, 1992, most waste deemed hazardous under the rule will have to be treated to reduce its toxicity before the residues can be taken to a landfill. The restrictions could become significantly tighter if expected challenges by environmental groups succeed. Sgt. Lance Erickson, an investigator in the California Highway Patrol's environmental crimes unit, joined other law enforcement officials in predicting even more illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes because of the new restrictions. \"I think (the trafficking) is going to increase because the prices are going to go up again,\" Erickson said. \"The bottom line is greed and money.\" In one of the few cases now under investigation, drums that has contained hazardous waste from the United States eventually were sold in a working-class Mexican neighborhood for water storage. \"In most cases, the barrel is the commodity of value down there,\" Carter said. In another instance, drums of cyanide solution from a North Hollywood metal-plating business that were destined for Mexico were listed as new products in the shipment manifest prepared by the trucker. The Mexicali address given as the destination turned out to be a wheat field. \"We are noticing this problem with increasing frequency,\" said Cesar Catalan of the Secretariat of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE), the Mexican version of the EPA. Catalan said the materials are dumped \"any place that isn't populated\" and in places \"that are easy to reach,\" such as spots along the border. The smuggling cases are difficult to prove, say California prosecutors, who often must rely on informants and witnesses. Any material that is considered waste under federal or state law cannot be taken across the border without the permission of Mexican environmental authorities. A one-two punch of increasingly strict environmental regulations and fewer legal landfills willing to take hazardous wastes hits hardest against such firms as metal platers, aerospace parts makers and radiator repair shops, which generate large amounts of toxic garbage. To dispose of hazardous wastes legally in this country, a generator must have his waste transported, treated and disposed of by a licensed firm. The process is increasingly costly and California landfills that will accept hazardous wastes are dwindling in number. A drum of hazardous waste that may have cost $140 to dispose of six years ago now costs $300, according to a waste management company. One prosecutor said the costs can go as high as $1,000 a barrel. Small- and medium-sized toxic waste generators -- often hard pressed to make ends meet -- are responsible for much of the illicit trafficking, investigators say. Larry Bishop, a hazardous materials specialist in Santa Barbara County, said if he was \"in the business and had a choice of spending $500,000 to get rid of chromic acid or to give someone $5,000 to get rid of it, the economic incentive is so great. . . . \"People are under a lot of pressure to do something with it and, unfortunately with small business people, it hits them particularly hard.\" Barry Roeser, general partner in a Baldwin Park hazardous waste consulting and referral service, told The Times he approached a financially troubled lumber company in the San Gabriel Valley a month ago to arrange for legal disposal of the firm's hazardous wastes. At the last minute, Roeser said, the businessman decided not to use his services. \" 'I don't need you any more,' \" Roeser quoted the businessman as saying. \" 'I'm sending it to Mexico.' \"If you can get away with it,\" Roeser said in an interview, \"what can I say? I know he took it to Mexico. What he did with it I don't know. . . . I imagine it just got dumped somewhere.\" The likelihood of being apprehended is remote, authorities say. Typically, U.S. customs inspectors watch only traffic headed north from Mexico. Southbound traffic entering Mexico gets little notice on the U.S. side, and there are reports that bribery occurs among Mexican border authorities. The CHP has only five investigators from Fresno to the Mexican border probing illegal waste shipments. The EPA, which is in charge of policing waste shipments across the border, has only one agent and two investigators to enforce several federal environmental statutes in California as well as three other Western states and U.S. islands in the Pacific. \"I don't really have the staff to pursue this export thing,\" said EPA resident agent-in-charge David Wilma, who is based in San Francisco. Although some officials have pleaded for years for strict border controls on hazardous waste, a San Diego County Hazardous Waste Task Force is only now formulating a plan to crack down. Anastacio Medina, a Los Angeles County hazardous materials investigator, said he urged participants at a San Diego hazardous waste workshop called by the EPA in late 1984 to take more action. \"We were told to mind our own business and let the feds do what they are supposed to be doing -- even though we know they are not doing it,\" Medina said. \"We thought it was inhuman the way (waste) was being handled in the hills and ravines of Tijuana,\" he said. \"Eventually these materials -- when the rains come -- are carried by the water down to the Tijuana River bed and contaminate some of the (well) water that Tijuana depends on. It also runs across the border into San Ysidro, so we do have a mutual interest.\" Los Angeles County environmental prosecutors say most of their time is spent on illegal dumping within the county, not on tracking substances across the border. The district attorney's office, which has one of the nation's toughest environmental crime units, has prosecuted at least 100 cases involving illegal disposal within the region -- in vacant lots, the Santa Monica Mountains and even back yards. In contrast, the office is now investigating about six cases of trafficking to Mexico. Charges in one case may be filed this week. Just as in local dumping, the smuggling of wastes into Mexico often is done by individuals who make a living in such trafficking. Describing the usual arrangements for exporting wastes, prosecutors say transporters and brokers typically collect a fee from waste generators to pick up the waste and provide the generator with the name of a facility and address in Mexico where the waste purportedly will be used as a new product -- possibly in a manufacturing process. The waste often is put into clean drums and labeled as new before it reaches the border. Shipping papers are filled out listing the cargo as unused. Sometimes the transporter both hauls and arranges a contact on the Mexican border and sometimes he uses a broker to act as the middleman to arrange the Mexican connection. In any case, the fee paid by the generator is substantially less than the cost of dumping the toxics legally. Customs officials rarely, if ever, open up such drums. \"The generator relies on these brokers or these transporters and is naive,\" said Carter of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. \"They want to believe that this stuff is (a new) product in Mexico, and that they are going to save money and do it legally. \"That is what they want to believe. Whether they do believe it is a different story.\" By labeling the waste as an unused material, transporters and generators try to take advantage of some ambiguities in the laws, investigators say. \"It's really kind of an honor system,\" Carter said. \"We get stuck in this quandary of what is waste and what is (a new) product.\" Legally, the generator is responsible for the waste and can be held liable if it is improperly dumped. But tracing waste once it gets past the Mexican border is difficult. Although some waste, such as old paint, may be used again in Mexico, other toxic materials may simply be dumped in fields or streams, authorities say. \"It's a big scam,\" said Bill Jones, chief of investigators for the Los Angeles County Health Department's hazardous materials control program. \"And it's the old story: Once you get to the border, the horses stop. We can't go any further.\" As serious as it is, the trafficking of hazardous waste from California to Mexico is but one facet of the growing problem of toxic exports. Hundreds of businesses owned by Americans and other foreigners operating on the Mexican side of the border are required by agreements reached between the various nations to return their hazardous waste to \"the country of origin\" for proper disposal. But state health authorities said they had no idea how much, if any, of the waste is being returned to California. Some authorities fear that waste produced by the Mexican border firms is being illegally dumped in Mexico. \"We don't have as good a handle on it as we would like to,\" state Health Department spokesman Allan Hirsch said Tuesday. \"We certainly hope it's not being dumped clandestinely in Mexico.\" An EPA enforcement agent said the agency has gotten reports of wastes from the border firms being returned to California for treatment, but he could not say how much. While several authorities estimated that perhaps only 10% of toxic waste generated in California is shipped out-of-state illegally, that still adds up to a formidable amount. California ranks 15th in the nation in legal toxic waste exports -- about 15.8 million pounds in 1987 -- according to an accounting made public this week by Inform, a New York City-based environmental research organization. Authorities say there are at least 50,000 generators of hazardous waste in the state, about 17,500 in Los Angeles County. According to the California Department of Health Services, only about 15 California firms have legally transported hazardous materials to foreign countries, primarily to Mexico, since reporting began in 1984. To be exported legally into Mexico, the hazardous substance must be usable or recyclable and officially acceptable to the Mexican government. But many firms can't or won't meet that test. Francis Odell, president of a large, modern metal-plating firm in Bell Gardens, said some metal-plating businesses are in such financial disarray that they are going out of business. Although most firms that remain comply with environmental regulations, Odell said, \"a minority\" look for the easy way out. \"They've got an economic problem of what to do,\" he said, \"and if they are given an offer to truck it off to Mexico, what do you do? It's tough to be moral when you're broke.\" Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Patrick McDonnell from Tijuana and Hector Tobar in Los Angeles.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA050990-0033", "score": 6.767199993133545}, {"content": "Title: Content: Wednesday April 6, 1994 Part IV Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1910 Personal Protective Equipment for General Industry; Final Rule Federal Register &blank;/&blank;Vol. 59, No. 66&blank;/&blank;Wednesday, April 6, 1994&blank;/&blank;Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1910 [Docket No. S&hyph;060] RIN 1218&hyph;AA71 Personal Protective Equipment for General Industry AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration; Labor.

The standards being revised include those containing general requirements for all PPE (1910.132) and standards that set design, selection, and use requirements for specific types of PPE (eye, face, head, foot and hand). The Agency is updating the standards for PPE to be more consistent with the current consensus regarding good industry practices, as reflected by the latest editions of the pertinent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards. The revision will provide guidance for the selection and use of PPE as well as clearer requirements that are performance-oriented, where appropriate. New paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) (containing requirements covering equipment selection, defective and damaged equipment, and training, respectively) have been added to 1910.132. Also, a new section (1910.138) has been added to this Subpart to address hazards to the hands. Non-mandatory appendices A and B have also been added to this Subpart to provide additional guidance to employers and employees with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards. DATES: This standard will become effective on July 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the standards is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 6, 1994.

Exhibit and transcript citations are separated by semicolons (Ex. 3: Ex. 7; Tr. 80: 4/3). I. Background The existing OSHA standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) are contained in Subpart I of OSHA's general industry standards. These standards were adopted in 1971 from established Federal standards and national consensus standards. In developing a proposed revision of Subpart I, the Agency performed a comprehensive review of the PPE standards. This review revealed several limitations and concerns with respect to these standards. First, OSHA determined that many of the existing PPE standards were outdated since they reflected knowledge and practices regarding PPE as they existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This meant that employers were being required to explain how compliance with more recent editions of the pertinent consensus standards provides equivalent protection to that provided by the older editions in the OSHA standards. Second, the Agency determined that there were certain gaps in coverage of the PPE standards, and that the standards set very restrictive design criteria which might limit the use of new technology. OSHA was concerned that restraints on innovation might also make it more difficult for employers either to increase acceptance of PPE, or to provide more protective PPE. Recognizing this situation, the Agency established a process under which OSHA has accepted, for example, on a case-by-case basis, the use of eye protection which, while not designed to meet the specifications in the existing standards, had been demonstrated to provide equivalent or superior worker protection. The Agency determined, however, that this process could not keep pace with the development of improved PPE. Consequently, OSHA was concerned that, unless the PPE standards were revised to be more performance-oriented, employers and product manufacturers might be discouraged from improving their equipment and from providing improved protection to workers. Also, OSHA had obtained injury data and technical reports which showed that injuries were occurring to employees who were wearing PPE as well as to those employees who were not wearing PPE. This indicated that, in some cases, significant improvements in PPE design and acceptance might be needed. Based on these concerns, OSHA developed a proposed revision to its PPE standards. The proposed revision was published in the Federal Register as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33832). OSHA proposed to revise the safety standards for eye and face protection (1910.133); head protection (1910.135); and foot protection (1910.136) by referencing the latest editions of the corresponding standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The provisions of existing 1910.134 and 1910.137 (which cover respiratory protection and electrical protective devices, respectively) are the subjects of separate rulemaking actions and are not addressed by this rulemaking. OSHA also proposed to revise the ``general requirements'' for PPE (1910.132) by adding provisions that: (1) require employers to select appropriate PPE based on the hazards present and to assure that employees who obtain their own PPE follow the employers' selection decisions; (2) prohibit the use of defective or damaged PPE; and (3) require that employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. The NPRM set a period, that ended on October 16, 1990, during which interested persons could comment on the proposal and request a hearing. OSHA received 129 comments in response to the proposal (Exhibit 3). The Agency also received several requests for an informal public hearing to discuss and clarify some of the requirements in the proposal, and to discuss and comment on issues and concerns raised as a result of the proposal. Accordingly, OSHA published a hearing notice on February 1, 1990 (55 FR 3412). The hearing notice requested testimony and supporting information on the following issues: (1) Marking of eye and face protection; (2) Third party certification; (3) The use of photochromic lenses; (4) Training in the proper use of PPE; and (5) The need for additional regulation of PPE (such as gloves, chemical protective clothing, and bump caps). The hearing notice (55 FR 3412) also extended the comment period until March 20, 1990. Hearings on the proposed standard were held in Washington, D.C., on April 3 and 4, 1990, with Administrative Law Judge Sheldon R. Lipson presiding. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Lipson set July 13, 1990, as the deadline for submission of post hearing comments and evidence, and September 11, 1990, as the deadline for submission of summations and briefs. On November 9, 1990, Judge Lipson certified the hearing record, including the hearing transcript and all written submissions to the docket. The rulemaking record contains 173 comments, 577 pages of testimony, and 53 exhibits. II. Workplace Hazards Involved OSHA has determined that workers involved in a wide range of occupations are exposed to a significant risk of death or injury from being struck by various objects in the workplace. OSHA's incident data indicate that a significant portion of all work related injuries and fatalities involve workers being struck in the eyes, head, face, hand, and or feet by foreign objects. For example, it has been estimated that as many as 2,500 eye injuries occur in the workplace every working day (Ex. 2: 9). One study indicated that there were 333,272 reported occupational eye injuries for 1985 (Ex. 2: 8). Another study, pertaining to disabling injuries, estimated that there were 320,000 hand and finger injuries, 70,000 eye injuries, 70,000 head and face injuries, and 110,000 foot and toe injuries in 1987. These injuries constituted 31.7 percent of the estimated 1,800,000 total disabling work injuries for 1987 (Ex. 2: 15). These examples indicate the degree of the hazard to which employees are exposed. OSHA reviewed many sources that described the type and number of injuries to employees (e.g. Ex. 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; Ex. 6: 2, 3, 4). While these sources differ as to the number and kind of injuries, they are consistent in pointing out the high incidence and severity of these accidents, and provide clear evidence of a significant risk to workers. In particular, one data source reviewed by OSHA included the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Injury Reports (WIR) on eye, face, foot, head and hand injuries (Ex. 2: 11, 12, 13, 14; Ex. 6: 2). These reports, which examined only those cases where a worker was injured, identified two major factors: Personal protective equipment was not being worn the vast majority of the time; and, when some type of protective equipment was worn, it did not fully protect the worker. For example, one study (Ex. 6: 2) indicated that 70% of the workers experiencing hand injuries were not wearing gloves. Hand injuries to the remaining 30% of the workers who were wearing gloves were caused by the gloves being either inadequate, damaged, or the wrong type for the type of hazard present. Based on the above-documented incidence of hand injury, OSHA has determined that employers and employees need more guidance regarding the selection of hand protection than is provided through the generic provisions of proposed 1910.132(d). Therefore, as discussed below, the Agency has provided performance-oriented provisions by adding 1910.138, `` Hand protection '' to the final rule. The final rule addresses the problems identified in the BLS reports by allowing new innovative designs through the use of performance-oriented language, by providing information for selecting the proper protection, and by improving the protection afforded by the equipment. OSHA believes that the revised standards will result in improvement in worker acceptance of wearing PPE by allowing better and more comfortable designs not presently permitted by the current standards, and by providing information on selecting the proper equipment for the job. The Agency has determined that compliance with the final rule will result in a significant reduction in the risks to workers. As noted in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, discussed below, it is estimated that full compliance with the final rule will prevent 712,000 lost-workdays and 4 fatalities a year. The Agency has also determined that the revised PPE requirements and criteria in the final rule provide a cost-effective means for reducing risks to workers. The Agency has determined that these provisions are reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the need for personal protective equipment. III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule This section contains an analysis of the rulemaking record pertaining to certain issues raised in the NPRM, and to the provisions of the standard, both as proposed and as promulgated. One general objection received during this rulemaking concerned the use of the phrase ``employers shall ensure'' in certain provisions of the proposed standard (e.g. Ex. 3: 46, 80, 94). The commenters expressed the view that, under the proposed language, employers would be held liable for violations of the standards, regardless of employee misconduct or other exculpatory considerations. The Agency had proposed the language in question to emphasize the employer's obligations for compliance with OSHA standards. The proposed language would not have affected an employer's ability to raise defenses to a citation. In light of the objections, OSHA is revising the proposed language to remove the phrase ``the employer shall ensure'' wherever it appears. The employer's obligations for compliance with standards issued under the OSH Act are unaffected by this change. Also, concern was expressed regarding the extent to which the proposed standard would allow employees to use PPE that satisfied the old ANSI standards which were being superseded by current editions through the proposal. In particular, some commenters (Ex. 3: 68, 69, 100) suggested that the Agency ``grandfather'' existing stocks of PPE (i.e., allow existing stocks of PPE to be depleted) as long as the PPE meets the ANSI standard in effect at the time of manufacture. Those commenters stated that, without grandfathering, employers would be required to bear the unreasonable expense and disruption of replacing millions of items of usable PPE. The proposal simply required the affected PPE to comply with the then-current editions of the pertinent ANSI standards, without indicating how PPE produced and tested to satisfy the existing OSHA standards would be treated. The Agency believes that virtually all of the PPE in question has been produced and tested to satisfy the ANSI editions referenced in either the proposed rule or in the final rule. Therefore, OSHA believes that, by and large, existing stocks of PPE would comply with the final rule. However, the Agency recognizes that some PPE that pre-dates the referenced ANSI standards might be unnecessarily excluded from use unless it was ``grandfathered''. In particular, certain protective footwear that complied with the 1983 ANSI edition referenced by the proposal could be excluded from use because it was not produced and tested to satisfy the 1991 edition referenced by the final rule, unless the employer demonstrated that the footwear provided equivalent protection. OSHA believes that the differences between the 1983 and 1991 editions are so slight that it would be unreasonable to require employers to demonstrate equivalency. The Agency also believes that PPE satisfying the pertinent criteria of the pre-1989 ANSI Z87.1 standard for eye and face protection or the pre-1986 Z89.1 standard for head protection will adequately protect affected employees. Therefore, the Agency agrees that it is appropriate to allow continued use of PPE that was purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule and has revised the proposed rule accordingly. In the final rule, as in the NPRM, OSHA has incorporated the pertinent ANSI standards by reference. The Agency has determined that it is unnecessary to adopt the text of the three ANSI standards, because their criteria are addressed to PPE manufacturers, not to employers who would be selecting PPE for use by their employees. OSHA believes that it is sufficient to require that employers ensure either that the PPE used by employees complies with the appropriate ANSI standard or that the PPE provides protection equivalent to that provided by PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. 1910.132 General Requirements. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section were not proposed for revision. Paragraph (a) requires that protective equipment be provided, used and maintained in sanitary and reliable condition, as necessary, to protect employees from workplace hazards. Paragraph (b) requires that, where employees provide their own equipment, the employer assure the adequacy, including the proper maintenance and sanitation, of such equipment. Paragraph (c) requires that all personal protective equipment be of safe design and construction for the work to be performed. Paragraph (d): Selection. OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (d), to 1910.132 to address the selection of PPE. OSHA proposed to require employers to select the PPE for their employees based on an assessment of the hazards in the workplace, and the hazards which employees are likely to encounter. Because OSHA is aware that some employees obtain their own PPE, the Agency also proposed that employers be required to inform their employees of the selection decisions and to have their employees follow those decisions when obtaining PPE. OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The Agency believes that the employer will be capable of determining and evaluating the hazards of a particular workplace. Paragraph (d) of the final rule is a performance-oriented provision which simply requires employers to use their awareness of workplace hazards to enable them to select the appropriate PPE for the work being performed. Paragraph (d) clearly indicates that the employer is accountable both for the quality of the hazard assessment and for the adequacy of the PPE selected. Proposed paragraph (d), which was substantively identical to the final rule, has been revised for the sake of clarity. The Agency has also added a note which references Non-mandatory Appendix B of 1910.132. That Appendix provides an example of procedures that satisfy the hazard assessment requirement. Most rulemaking participants supported the proposed requirement (e.g. Ex. 3: 90, 91, 102). However, some commenters stated that the proposed paragraph did not clearly indicate if employers would be required to document the hazard assessment. For example, a commenter from S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc. (Ex. 3: 1) suggested that OSHA clarify documentation requirements of the workplace assessment. In addition, a commenter from Union Carbide (Ex. 3: 68, pp. 1&hyph;2) stated: *&blank;*&blank;*&blank;OSHA should clarify that the hazard assessment referred to there need not be in writing. OSHA can best determine whether the employer conducted an adequate hazard assessment by inspecting the areas where PPE is required. It should not be necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment. OSHA believes that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance officers and affected employees with appropriate assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed. The Agency agrees with the commenter that it is not ``necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.'' Given the performance-oriented nature of this rulemaking, OSHA has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be unnecessarily burdensome. The Agency has addressed such situations in other rulemakings by requiring employers to verify their compliance with a requirement through a written certification. For example, OSHA has required certification of training in the permit-required confined space standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); in the Telecommuni-cations standard, 1910.268(c); and (as discussed below) in 1910.132(f)(4) of this final rule. The Agency has found that a written certification is a reasonable means by which to establish accountability for compliance. Therefore, the Agency has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(d) of the final rule through a written certification which identifies the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the evaluation has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identifies the document as a certification of hazard assessment. This requirement has been added to the final rule as paragraph (d)(2). The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect ``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j)) specifies that `` Information does not generally include *&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.'' OSHA has determined that the certification required by paragraph (d)(2) constitutes a ``certification'' for the purposes of the PRA. Therefore, that certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR part 1320). Another concern raised during this rulemaking, related to the selection process, was the subject of proper fit of PPE. A commenter (Ex. 7:10) has stated that, in the past, males constituted the majority of the workforce and PPE was sized accordingly. As more and more females have entered the workforce, they often have had to choose between wearing PPE that was sized to fit males, and not wearing PPE at all. This was particularly common with foot protection. As a result, female workers frequently either have used PPE which did not adequately protect them, or have simply stopped using PPE because of improper fit and subsequent discomfort. Based on concern for the safety of female employees, the commenter suggested that OSHA require PPE to fit properly. OSHA agrees with this comment. Since females constitute a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before, it is imperative that they (as well as male employees) be provided with PPE that fits properly. Therefore, OSHA is revising 1910.132 (d) to add proper fit as a criterion for PPE selection. Paragraph (e): Defective and damaged equipment. OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (e), to 1910.132 that stated: Defective or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used. This paragraph is based, in part, on existing 1910.133 (a)(2)(vii), which states that eye protectors should be kept clean and in good repair. Under the proposed paragraph, the existing requirement was to be strengthened and extended to cover all PPE, not just eye protectors. Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 41) stated that proposed paragraph (e) should only cover visually observable defects or damage. For example, a commenter from Johnson Wax (Ex. 3: 1) stated: We urge OSHA to limit the scope of this section to ``visible'' defects or damage in PPE. OSHA certainly agrees that visibly damaged or defective PPE must not be used. However, there are other methods (such as performance tests to ensure continued integrity) that the employer could use to assure that the PPE used by employees is repaired or replaced as necessary for the protection of each affected employee. Also, employees can often determine if the protectiveness of the PPE has been compromised when they are handling the PPE prior to or while donning it. Accordingly, OSHA believes it would be inappropriate to narrow this provision to cover only visible defects or damage. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating paragraph 1910.132 (e) as proposed. Paragraph (f): Training. Proposed paragraph (f) required employers to train employees in the proper use of their PPE. This proposed provision was based on OSHA's recognition that, as documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (Ex. 2: 11, 12, 13, 14), a significant number of the employees who sustain work-related injuries have not been trained in the proper use of PPE. Some commenters (Ex. 3: 64, 117, 119) stated that PPE training, while necessary for respirators and other complex PPE, is not necessary for relatively simple equipment such as safety shoes and eye protectors. In particular, the American Trucking Association (ATA) (Ex. 3: 64) stated: Requiring training and record-keeping for all PPE would severely burden motor carriers in terms of time and the related costs. As an alternative, the ATA suggested that OSHA set non-mandatory appendices for the guidance of employers. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 84, 104, 121) suggested that the employer be required to train employees only for use of the PPE that is required by the employer to provide protection against hazards identified for the particular workplace. The Texas Chemical Council (Ex. 3: 121) stated: Requiring the employer to train employees on equipment they provide creates an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on the employer. Several commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 83, 90, 106, 126) supported the training requirement, as proposed. Du Pont (Ex. 3: 90, pg. 2) remarked: Du Pont's position is that proper employee training is fundamental to an effective PPE program. We also agree with the flexibility this proposed section provides employers. Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 100, 104) suggested that OSHA revise the proposed paragraph (f) to indicate that training need only be provided when PPE is first provided to employees. For example, Union Electric (Ex. 3: 100) said: Company suggests adding ``at the time it is initially issued.'' The proposal, as written, could imply that employees must be periodically retrained in the proper use of their equipment. This certainly is unnecessary for such items as safety glasses, footwear and headgear, which usually are worn routinely on the job. Respirators already have a periodic training requirement. Also, several commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 64, 102, 117) expressed concern that proposed 1910.132(f) would require employers to operate formal training programs. For example, Monsanto (Ex. 3: 102, pg. 2) stated that OSHA should revise proposed paragraph (f) to indicate clearly that the training required need not be formal classroom training. In addition, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) inquired: In regard to training all employees in the proper use of all PPE, what would qualify as ``training''? The term ``training'' could range from awareness type information to competency training of the employee. OSHA should define the term ``training'' or be specific in individual standards. Some commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 81, 119) stated that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to require ``instruction'' rather than ``training''. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3: 81, pg. 2) said: Training is too elaborate a term for the degree of explanation required with PPE. More sophisticated PPE such as respirators or hearing protection, which require detailed training, is already provided for by certain OSHA standards. MVMA recommends that subparagraph (f) be retitled ``Instruction'' and the term ``training'' be changed to ``instructed''. Some public hearing participants testified in support of the proposed 1910.132(f) performance-oriented approach to training. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) testified (Tr. 159: 4/3): *&blank;*&blank;* CMA agrees that training is an essential element of an effective personal protective equipment program. We believe, however, that OSHA should continue to address training with performance-oriented provisions, not with HAZWOPER-type training requirements. Not only are additional requirements not necessary, they would be over-burdensome. In addition, many commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 36, 41, 50, 60, 73, 86, 98, 116, 128) suggested that OSHA revise proposed 1910.132(f) to provide more detailed guidance regarding what constitutes adequate training. For example, CSX Transportation (Ex. 3: 116) remarked: A description of the performance requirements for a PPE training program should be included under 1910.132(f), since training is the responsibility of the employer. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 123 and 128) emphasized that ``personal'' training is important to a successful training program. For example, the Food & Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128, pg. 6) stated: It is imperative that this training be conducted by ``live'' personnel who will be available to answer questions that workers may have. Simply showing a twenty minute video tape shall not constitute adequate training. Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and care'' of PPE. For example, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 3: 73, pg. 2) said: To further enhance the protection provided by the standard, EEI recommends amending proposed 1910.132(f) to require employees to be trained not only in the use of their equipment, but also in its care. Further, some commenters (Ex. 3: 41, 59, 128) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and limitations'' of PPE. The Food & Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128) stated that training in the limitations of PPE is needed ``to prevent accidents from occurring due to overconfidence in the protective ability of certain types of equipment.'' Other commenters (Ex. 3: 60, 107&hyph;D) suggested that employees be trained regarding PPE limitations and precautions. The American Optometric Association (Ex. 3: 60) remarked: We do not believe that Section 1910.132(f) on training requirements goes far enough to ensure that any limitations or precautions provided by the manufacturer of the protector are transmitted to the user and care is taken to see that such limitations are strictly observed. In addition, we do not believe that appendix B Non-Mandatory Compliance Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment Selection adequately addresses this area. There is no guarantee that the training provided employees in the use of eye and face protectors will uniformly cover the limitations and precautions relating to the use of protectors unless specific requirements for this training are given. We strongly urge that language making this a mandatory part of training be included in the regulation. Some other commenters (Ex. 3: 74, 88) suggested that training include information provided by PPE manufacturers. For example, CF Industries, Inc. (CF) (Ex. 3: 74) objected to the proposed replacement of existing 1910.133(a)(5) (which requires employers to pass on to employees any information received from manufacturers regarding the limitations and precautions to be considered when using eye and face protection) by proposed 1910.132(f). The commenter stated: ``CF believes that the proposed section is too broad. Various pieces of personal protective equipment can be used for the same purpose, but have very different limitations.'' Also, two commenters from the State of Connecticut (Ex. 3: 50, 51) stated that ``the final rule for 1910.132(f) should lean towards being more specific'' and that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to provide that ``Employees shall be trained in the proper use, maintenance, care, warning labels and limitations of their personal protective equipment.'' Other commenters (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should be revised to incorporate the specific training requirements of existing 1910.120, the standard for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER). For example, the Emergency Response Management & Training Corporation (Ex. 3: 97) stated: As it [proposed 1910.132(f)] is currently written there are no specifications as to the quality or quantity of training an employee will receive on the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment. The inclusion of specific knowledge requirements and competency demonstration may assist in the goal of improving worker safety in hazardous environments. 29 CFR 1910.120 and NFPA 472&hyph;1989 (Standard for Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous Materials Incidents) are two examples of this type. Based on the concerns expressed regarding what constitutes adequate training, OSHA requested testimony in Issue 4 of the hearing notice (54 FR 3414, February 1, 1990) on the need for additional training requirements. In particular, Issue 4 indicated that OSHA was considering the promulgation of more specific training requirements, including provisions similar to those in existing 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER). The Agency also solicited input regarding what training is needed; how training can be evaluated; when retraining is necessary; how much time is required for training; what recordkeeping is necessary for training activities; and what impacts (i.e., costs and benefits) the training requirements would have. With respect to Issue 4, several commenters (Ex. 7: 3, 8, 11, 20, 29, 38) stated that the training requirements should be more detailed. For example, the General Electric Company (Ex. 7: 3, pg. 2) said: Protective equipment training needs to include: 1. Where and how personnel can get the equipment, 2. A system for identifying the correct equipment for an application *&blank;*&blank;* procedures and operating manuals should include specifics on protective equipment types, needs and objectives, 3. Equipment should be shown to individuals prior to using each for the first time *&blank;*&blank;* let them touch and try the items on, the more senses you allow one to use during training the better the person will recall what he/she learned, 4. Persons should not be considered competent in protective equipment items until they do a practical test *&blank;*&blank;* are able to properly put on the item, explain what protection it provides, etc. Also, Boeing (Ex. 7: 38) remarked: Boeing supports the position that additional detail be included in 1910.132 regarding training objectives and methods. Training should be based on the complexity of the protective equipment requirements. For certain protective equipment (e.g. safety spectacles) training requirements should be minimal or nonexistent. In addition, OSHA received testimony in favor of more specific training requirements at the public hearing. For example, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) testified (Tr. 23&hyph;24: 4/3) that the key elements of a successful training program are: 1) Sensitizing the workers to the need for such protectors and inviting their participation in developing a suitable plan for affecting PPE use. 2) Clearly defining the written goals of the PPE program in terms of the target behaviors sought (e.g., appropriate footwear/eyewear/headwear to be worn, in what areas, what kinds of care required). 3) Explicit rewards or recognition to be given contingent on the workers displaying actions that conform to the aforementioned positive acts, including knowledge of results or other forms of feedback. 4) Each PPE program should have some basis for evaluation (numbers of workers using/not using specified PPE) so that modifications could be made should the efforts fall short of the stated goals. Also, the International Chemical Workers Union testified (Tr. 16: 4/4): Who is responsible for training employees in the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment? It is the employer's responsibility to carry out this training but it is not being done *&blank;*&blank;* Every worker should be able to determine that the glove being provided to them by their employer is the right one for the chemicals which they handle. Another hearing participant, the National Environmental Training Association (NETA), testified (Tr. 272: 4/4) that ``the proposal in 132(f) is not performance-oriented, it's too vague and nonspecific.'' NETA also testified (Tr. 285: 4/4): The National Environmental Testing Association feels that if OSHA seriously considers training to be important in protecting worker safety *&blank;*&blank;* then the language at 29 CFR 1910.132(f) will have to be more specific. Unless training is based on measurable objectives as OSHA has pointed out in the U.S. Department of Labor publication OSHA 2254 (Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines) then it can only be effective by coincidence. Many Issue 4 commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 2, 13, 15, 21, 22) stated that OSHA should not promulgate more detailed training requirements. Those commenters expressed the belief that performance-oriented proposed 1910.132(f) allowed employers in general industry the flexibility to implement training programs as needed. For example, Amoco Corporation (Ex. 7: 21, pg.2) stated: We agree that employees should be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment, since the equipment may not provide adequate protection if used improperly. We feel, however, that training programs are best left to each employer to develop on an individualized, site-specific basis. Manufacturers often provide information on their particular products upon which an instructional program can be based. Employers do need an effective formal training session when the use of new or significantly different equipment is instituted. This requirement helps ensure that time is actually dedicated to this purpose, and emphasizes the importance of proper use to the employee. Training guidance would be helpful, especially to small businesses, but we feel strongly that such guidance should be of a non-mandatory nature. In addition, the Department of the Air Force (Ex. 7: 25) stated that it ``supports locally devised training, rather than an OSHA legislated program training requirement, as both cost efficient and effective.'' Also, several Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 19, 31, 35) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should not incorporate the HAZWOPER training requirements, because 1) general industry PPE was used in a broader class of work environments than HAZWOPER-mandated PPE, and 2) the PPE covered by proposed 1910.132(f) (e.g., eye and face protection, head protection and foot protection) was much less complex than that covered by HAZWOPER. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 7: 35) stated: Suggestions that would treat Subpart I in a manner similar to paragraph 1910.120 are without justification. There is no relationship between the training requirements of paragraph 1910.120 (which are directly responsive to the enabling legislation dealing with hazardous waste sites) and the use of PPE in the controlled environment of a more typical place of employment. In addition, the National Solid Waste Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 2&hyph;3): While NSWMA supports the concept of a structure for training of employees in the use of PPE, we find the use of the Part 1910.120 training requirements for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response as a model for general industry to be without any justification. The Section 1910.120 rule was intended to provide specific safety criteria to cover a specific industry segment. There are other industries with equivalent or higher risks where the use of this section as a model would be appropriate. NSWMA suggests that OSHA instead consider a training requirement more closely aligned with the concepts of its Hazard Communication Standard, wherein the complexity of the program required for compliance would be directly related to the hazards present. Such a program would require a survey of hazards, establishment of specifications for PPE to control those hazards, training for employees and documentation of the training, and availability of PPE information to employees *&blank;*&blank;* In the low-risk example, having donning and doffing procedures formalized provides no useful function. What is critical is communicating the need for employees to understand the hazards and the need to utilize PPE on a consistent basis. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA agrees with commenters that employers need more specific guidance regarding how to train employees who use PPE. In particular, the Agency has determined that employees need training which enables them to know, at least: 1) when PPE is necessary; 2) what PPE is necessary; 3) how to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 4) the limitations of the PPE; and 5) the proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. Accordingly, OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (f) so that paragraph (f)(1) of the final rule reads as follows: The employer shall provide training, including retraining where appropriate, to each employee who is required by this section to use PPE. Each such employee shall be trained to know at least the following: (i) When PPE is necessary; (ii) What PPE is necessary; (iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; (iv) The limitations of the PPE; and (v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE. The National Environmental Training Association (NETA) and other rulemaking participants asserted that in order to have a successful training program, employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees demonstrate that they have reached those objectives. For example, NETA testified (Tr. 272&hyph;286: 4/4) that in order for training to be successful, clear and measurable objectives must be set, and employees must demonstrate that the training objectives have been reached, by showing that they understand the information provided and that they can use the PPE properly. OSHA agrees with these remarks and has stated in one of its own publications (OSHA 2254&hyph;1988): *&blank;*&blank;* in order for the training to be as successful as possible, clear and measurable objectives should be thought out before the training begins. For an objective to be effective, it should identify as precisely as possible what the individuals will do to demonstrate that they have learned, or that the objective has been reached. They should also describe the important conditions under which the individual will demonstrate competence and define what constitutes acceptable performance. Therefore, paragraph (f)(2) of the final rule requires that each affected employee demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1), and the ability to use the PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE. Paragraph (f)(3) of the final rule requires retraining when changes in workplace conditions or changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete, and when inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the understanding or skill required by paragraph (f)(2). This provision, which did not appear in the proposed rule, indicates clearly that employers have an ongoing responsibility to maintain employee proficiency in the use and care of their PPE. OSHA received many comments regarding how employers would indicate their compliance with the proposed training requirement. Some commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 41, 90) noted a statement in the NPRM (54 FR at 33841) that ``the proposal contains no recordkeeping requirements.'' Those commenters agreed with that approach, expressing the belief that detailed recordkeeping would impose an unreasonable burden, and requested ``clarification'' that no recordkeeping for training would be required. Further, Detroit Edison (Ex. 3: 62), referring to proposed paragraph (f), noted, ``Documented proof of training is required by other regulation. Is documentation required? OSHA should present a clearer picture of this requirement or delete it.'' In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96) inquired, ``Will perceived improper use of PPE be deemed by OSHA evidence of inadequate training in the absence of training documentation?'' Also, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) stated, ``Even though OSHA has stated to OMB that this NPR does not have any recordkeeping requirements, what would be required to prove the ``training'' has been performed?'' Members of the Midwest Consortium for Hazardous Waste Worker Training (Ex. 3: 49, 59, 98, 123) suggested that OSHA require employers to document the content of their training programs. For example, Murray State University (Ex. 3: 123) stated, ``Training should be mainly hands-on with appropriate documentation.'' In addition, several commenters (e.g. 3: 46, 75, 88, 116) stated that proposed paragraph (f) would already require employers to document training. Some of those commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 88) stated simply that, contrary to the statement in Section VII of the proposed rule, OSHA had proposed to require recordkeeping, so the Agency had a responsibility to justify the burden and to properly estimate the cost of documentation. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 116) stated that the documentation was needed to verify compliance with the training requirements, and that OSHA should not impose extensive recordkeeping requirements. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) stated (Ex. 3: 75): CMA agrees with OSHA's determination to omit recordkeeping from the proposed rule. While some form of verification should be maintained as an indication that training has taken place, specific documentation requirements would only add to the recordkeeping burden without increased safety benefits for employees. In addition, CSX Transportation (Ex. 3: 116) remarked: In Section 1910.132 a new training requirement exists that will require the establishment of training records for employees using PPE. While the standard does not specify any recordkeeping requirements, documentation for compliance purposes is clearly indicated. As noted above, OSHA requested additional comments on the proposed training provision, including information on the recordkeeping needed to document compliance, in Issue 4 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990). In particular, Issue 4 indicated that, based on NPRM comments (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97), OSHA was considering training requirements similar to the HAZWOPER provisions promulgated in 1910.120(e). Section 1910.120(e)(6) requires employers to certify successful completion of training and to give graduates a written certificate. That provision further provides that persons who lack such certification shall be prohibited from engaging in hazardous waste operations. In response to Issue 4, Jackson Products (Ex. 7: 8, pg. 2) stated: Training of employees in the use of PPE should be the central focus of any rules OSHA is promulgating, as this issue has the highest potential for reducing worker injuries. Documentation of the training programs could follow the existing guidelines OSHA has developed for hazardous waste operations and employee right to know training, i.e., training log, employee signature sheet, etc. In addition, BP America (Ex. 7: 39) stated, ``we feel that the only criteria for successful completion of a training course can be that the trainee has mastered the information to the instructor's satisfaction. This can be documented in several ways including written exams and awarding of certificates.'' As noted above, some Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 13, 19, 25, 31, 35) opposed the adoption of the HAZWOPER training provisions in proposed paragraph (f). Regarding the applicability of the HAZWOPER recordkeeping requirements, the National Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 3): Congress mandated additional regulations in the narrow field of the occupational safety and health of hazardous waste workers because hazardous waste operations and remediations involve, in OSHA's words, ``unique'' work environments. 54 Fed. Reg. 9312. Congress recognized that such operations involve potential exposure to a number of hazardous health risks unlike those encountered by employees in general industry activities. Thus, the OSHA standard prohibits work upon a hazardous waste site by anyone who is not properly OSHA-qualified and OSHA-certified. Certification may be granted only upon completion of initial training and continuing education courses within a comprehensive and exhaustive number of areas. See 29 CFR 1910.120(e)(6). These comprehensive standards apply whenever and wherever hazardous waste workers handle hazardous substances. The occupational safety and health requirements in Section 1910.120 were, accordingly, crafted in response to the Congressional insistence that safety and health standards more stringent than those applied to general industry be fashioned. As noted above, the NSWMA suggested that OSHA model the requirements of proposed 1910.132(f) on the Hazard Communication Standard. The NSWMA recognized that recordkeeping would be necessary for training, stating: ``In a low-risk situation, where bump hats and eye shields may be the only devices needed, a simple written program of several pages would suffice.'' In addition, the NSWMA stated: Companies should not be required under this suggested system to gain prior OSHA certification of individual programs. Rather, companies should be permitted to certify that they have developed and implemented programs that are consistent with OSHA approved standards. OSHA acknowledges that the proposed training provision implicitly required some method for verifying compliance. The Agency believes that the discussion of recordkeeping in Issue 4 of the hearing notice provided adequate notice that OSHA might require employers to create some method of verifying their training activities. Accordingly, based on the rulemaking record and for the sake of clarity, the Agency is revising proposed paragraph (f) to state explicitly that employers must verify that they have provided their employees with the requisite training. Regarding the information needed to verify compliance, OSHA agrees with the commenters who have stated that it would be inappropriate to require specific documentation of the training provided. Given the performance-oriented focus of this rulemaking, the Agency has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be unnecessarily burdensome. The Agency also notes that the training needs of employees covered by paragraph (f) of this section (approximately 22 million) are too diverse to enable OSHA to specify the details required for all of their PPE training. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(f) of the final rule through a written certification. The Agency has determined that a certification record which identifies each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification of training in the use of PPE, will provide adequate assurance that the employer has provided the requisite training. The Agency notes that OSHA has also required certification of training in the permit&hyph;required confined space standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); and, in the Telecommunications standard, 1910.268(c). OSHA also notes that such a document will not preclude a citation if the Agency determines that the employees have not, in fact, been adequately trained. OSHA believes that compliance with this requirement, while imposing a minimal burden, provides an important benefit because it enables the employer and OSHA to verify the status of training efforts. Therefore, OSHA is promulgating new 1910.132(f)(4). The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect ``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j)) specifies that ``Information does not generally include *&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.'' OSHA has determined that the certification of training required by paragraph (f)(4) constitutes a ``certification'' for the purposes of the PRA.Therefore, the certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320). 1910.133 Eye and face protection. Proposed 1910.133(a) contained general requirements for eye and face protection. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) required the employer to ensure that employees use appropriate eye or face protection when they are exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acid and caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) also required that eye protection used by employees provide both front and side protection from flying objects. This portion of proposed paragraph (a)(1) resulted in many comments. Most rulemaking participants agreed with OSHA that eye protectors should provide both front and side protection from flying objects (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 49, 59, 61, 83, 128; Tr. 53: 4/3) because studies (Ex. 2: 11) have indicated that most injuries have occurred (in those instances when eye protection was used) because flying objects went around the protection. However, several rulemaking participants disagreed with this requirement because they believed that OSHA was proposing that all eye protectors would have to provide side protection (e.g. Ex. 3: 41, 69). For example, a commenter from the Exxon Company (Ex. 3: 47, pp.1&hyph;2) said: Exxon is concerned that the proposal could be interpreted to require all safety glasses to be equipped with side shields. Exxon's position is that many situations exist where safety glasses without side shields are adequate. For such routine operations, OSHA should not ignore the fact that most employees will be more reluctant to wear safety glasses with side shields than glasses without side shields. The mandatory use of side shields on all safety glasses could deter the overall use of safety glasses on and off the job which would ultimately lead to an increase in the total number of eye injuries. We concur with OSHA that employees should be equipped with adequate eye protection to prevent injuries from flying objects. In those instances where our employees may be potentially exposed to flying objects, our safety program calls for the mandatory use of eye protection that provides both front and side protection. Another commenter, from the American Optometric Association, remarked (Ex. 3: 60, pg. 2): While we recognize that mandatory side shields would afford additional protection in many instances, they may not be practical in all situations. In addition, they may tend to reduce compliance with the use of the protector in cases where peripheral hazard protection is not required. We would recommend that side shields be required only when the job evaluation indicates that a definite peripheral hazard exists. OSHA intended that proposed paragraph (a)(2) require side protection only when flying object hazards were present. Therefore, the Agency has revised the provision concerning flying object hazards to state clearly that front and side protection are required when there is a hazard from flying objects. OSHA agrees that there are situations when side protection is unnecessary, and that employers should be allowed to decide, based on a hazard assessment which complies with the requirements of 1910.132(d) of the final rule, if such protection is necessary for their employees. While one rulemaking participant (Ex. 3: 66) believed that side shields should be permanently attached, other rulemaking participants stated that side protectors need not be permanent and that OSHA should permit detachable or clip-on side protectors. For example, a commenter from Liberty Optical (Ex. 3: 63) said: Clip-on side shields meet all the Z&hyph;87 performance standards that the permanent side shields meet and can be worn when necessary. To be able to wear proper protection where appropriate and be realistic in its use, will make the employee not look to side step it and, therefore, make it more effective and safer. If a blanket mandatory permanent side shield regulation to cover all industrial environments is implemented, it will reverse all gains made in recent years and will not accomplish its goal for a safer industrial environment. OSHA agrees that side protection need not be permanent and that detachable side shields should be permitted as long as they meet the criteria specified in this section of the final rule. Permitting detachable side shields will provide employers the flexibility to use this kind of protection when necessary, based on conditions at the workplace. The Agency has revised proposed paragraph (a)(1) accordingly, dividing the proposed paragraph into two provisions, 1910.133(a)(1) and (a)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule states the general requirement to have each employee use eye or face PPE when exposed to eye or face hazards, while paragraph (a)(2) states that eye PPE must provide side protection, which may be detachable, when flying object hazards are present. Proposed paragraph (a)(2) required that eye and face protection properly fit employees. Although the Agency did not receive any comments concerning the proper fit of eye and face protection, OSHA did receive comments addressing the proper fit of PPE, in general, and the need for properly fitting PPE for both male and female employees. This subject was discussed previously under 1910.132 of this preamble, and OSHA has included a requirement in 1910.132 of the final rule that all PPE properly fit employees. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(2) has not been included in the final rule, since it would be redundant. OSHA proposed in paragraph (a)(3) that protectors with tinted or variable tinted lenses not be worn when an employee must pass from a brightly lighted area, such as outdoors, into a dimly lighted area, such as a warehouse. The Agency proposed this requirement because it believed that the provision might reduce the likelihood that extreme lighting changes would temporarily impair the vision of an employee. This proposed requirement was the subject of Issue 3 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3412, February 1, 1990). The proposed paragraph and Issue 3 generated a substantial amount of comment and testimony. While a few rulemaking participants agreed with the proposed provision (e.g. Ex. 3: 28; Ex. 7: 2, 38), many opposed the provision and/or approach proposed by OSHA (e.g. Ex. 3: 55, 61, 68; Ex. 7: 7, 8, 15, 23; Tr. 193: 4/3; Tr. 150&hyph;156: 4/4; Tr. 169: 4/4). Some of the rulemaking participants stated that the proposed paragraph was too restrictive and vague. These rulemaking participants stated that the employer (or designated safety officer) should decide when the use of this type of eyewear may create a hazard. This approach is similar to that used in the ANSI standard for eye protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989; paragraph 6.5.2). For example, a commenter from the American Optometric Association (Ex. 7: 11, pg. 2) stated: The use of photochromic lenses in industrial situations is dependent upon the visual demands of the task and the visual needs of the wearer. The decision on the need for and use of photochromic lenses can best be made by evaluation of the work place requirements by the employer in consultation with the employee's eye doctor. The development of a blanket policy restricting the use of photochromic lenses for certain job tasks is unwarranted. The individual visual needs and working conditions should dictate when photochromic lenses may be inappropriate. The American Optometric Association supports the ANSI Z87.1 position which provides employers the discretion to decide when photochromic lenses may be utilized. Additionally, an ophthalmologist from the Mount Sinai Medical Center (Ex. 7: 14 pg. 2) remarked: *&blank;*&blank;* the many beneficial features of photochromic lenses, particularly in safety glasses, justifies their continued unfettered use in the workplace. My concern is that this proposed government intervention will likely deter workers from using these photochromic lenses as safety devices and that increased numbers of eye injuries and workplace accidents will ultimately result. A hearing participant from Corning, Inc. (Tr. 111&hyph;114: 4/4) testified: Today, photochromic lenses are used throughout the world and over 500 million lenses have been sold. Roughly, more than 250 million pairs of eye glasses. Currently, more than 38 million photochromic lens blanks are sold each year. Corning has therefore literally hundreds of millions of man years of experience with the use of photochromic eyeglasses without any reported health of safety problem of the type to which the proposed regulation is addressed. I believe that proposal 1910.133 (a)(3) is too vague and is in any event unnecessary and overly restrictive. The use of photochromic lenses are subject to the ANSI Z87.1 standards including paragraph 6.5.2 and we believe this is the appropriate standard for dealing with any possible need for a limitation on photochromic usage. That witness also asserted (Tr. 120: 4/4): In daylight, outdoors, when the photochromic lenses darken to function as sunglasses they protect the eyes dark adaptation process. It is well known that those who wear sunglasses in sunlight adapt to darker environments up to twice as fast as those who do not. In the transient condition, that is, coming in from a brighter outdoor condition to a darker indoor condition, wearing photochromic lenses can actually provide better and more comfortable vision under a broad variety of work conditions. Visual function in the transition to and from bright light is superior when photochromic rather than clear lenses are used. After evaluating the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the proposed requirement was too restrictive. The Agency has determined that the employer, or the employer's representative (such as the company safety professional), will be in the best position to determine when tinted or variable tint lenses should or should not be used, based on awareness of workplace conditions. OSHA also notes that this approach is consistent with the current ANSI standard (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989-paragraph 6.5.2) which is (as discussed below) being incorporated by reference in the final rule. Accordingly, proposed paragraph (a)(3) has not been retained in the final rule. Proposed paragraph (a)(4) required that employees who wear prescription lenses while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in their design, or shall be protected by eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of the prescription or protective lenses. The Agency did not receive any comments on this proposed provision and it is, therefore, contained in the final rule as proposed. However, since this section has been reorganized, the provision has been redesignated as 1910.133(a)(3) of the final rule. Existing 1910.133 (a)(4) states that ``every protector shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification only of the manufacturer.'' OSHA had proposed to delete this provision because the Agency believed that compliance did not add to or detract from the safety of the protector. Although a few commenters agreed with OSHA in principle (e.g. Ex. 3: 50, 92, 115), the vast majority of commenters stated that the marking requirement should not be deleted (e.g. Ex. 3: 75, 88, 92, 114, 126). For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (Ex. 3: 71, pg. 4) asserted: The existing system of easily identifying the manufacturers of the components of eye PPE is embedded in the standard to assure accountability and is accepted throughout the industry. It should be retained. In addition, a commenter from Monsanto (Ex. 3: 102, pg. 3) stated: Since employees are permitted to provide their own eye protection and employers are held accountable to ensure that employees are wearing the proper eye protection, these markings provide employers a ready way of checking for whether or not employees are wearing the proper eye protection. Also, CF Industries (Ex. 3: 74) commented: The identification markings are necessary in the event of a manufacturing defect or material defect, so that the purchaser may receive an adjustment from the seller or manufacturer. Identification is also needed in case the manufacturer makes a product recall. Dr. Joseph F. Novak (Ex. 3: 107&hyph;A) commented: My suggestion is that OSHA approved safety eyewear be marked in a manner similar to that of the ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 Code. In supporting the concept that OSHA should be consistent with the ANSI requirement for marking, a commenter from US West, Inc. (Ex. 3: 85, pp. 2&hyph;3) stated: US WEST, Inc. recommends that the identifying marking, i.e. manufacturers monogram and ``Z87'', continue to be required (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 8.10). US WEST, Inc. disagrees with OSHA's statement that``\u00a7*&blank;*&blank;* marking to identify the manufacturers of eye and face protection does not add or delete from the safety afforded by the protector.'' Lenses meeting ANSI Z87 are easily identified by the manufacturers monogram. ``Street'' or ``dress'' spectacles not meeting ANSI Z87 are also easily identified by the absence of such markings. US WEST, Inc. has found non-Z87 replacement prescription lenses placed in employees Z87 frames, reducing the employees degree of protection. Based on the above-discussed comments, OSHA included Issue 1 in the Hearing Notice, to elicit more information regarding the utility of compliance with existing 1910.133(a)(4). The comments and testimony received (Ex. 7: 2, 13, 31; Tr. 55, 133, 156: 4/3; Tr. 68, 148, 225: 4/4) uniformly supported retaining the marking requirement. For example, one commenter from SIGNODE (Ex. 7: 6) stated: There is agreement that marking of eye and face protection ``does not add or detract from the safety afforded by the protector'' however, the current etched lens marking provide the safety manager, management and supervision a means of verifying that the worker, employee, contractor or visitor is, in fact, wearing proper safety eyewear, not street wear.Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the requirement for marking of eye and face protectors should be retained. OSHA agrees with commenters that the marking of eye and face protectors provides easy recognition that the protectors meet specified criteria (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989); that marking will provide accountability, and traceability in cases of product recall; and that marking requirements should be consistent with the ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 standard, since this is the accepted and recognized practice throughout the industry. Accordingly, the requirement for marking of eye and face protectors is being retained in 1910.133(a)(4) of the final rule. Proposed paragraph (a)(5) required that employees use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate for the work being performed for protection from potentially injurious light radiation. OSHA also proposed a table in this paragraph which contained a list of appropriate shade numbers for various operations. The Agency did not receive any comments on this provision, and it is contained in the final rule with minor editorial changes. Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 contained ``acceptable design'' requirements for eye and face protection. In this provision, OSHA proposed that eye and face protection comply with the design requirements specified in ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989, or be of a design which could be demonstrated to be equally effective. Rulemaking participants supported the proposed adoption of the ANSI standard for eye and face protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989). However, a few commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 101, 125) expressed concern that the Agency proposed to adopt only the ``design requirements'' of ANSI Z87.1. These commenters asserted that OSHA should adopt by reference all of the ANSI standard, not just the design requirements. OSHA agrees that eye and face protective devices must meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This requirement is stated explicitly in ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989, Section 3. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 in its entirety and is revising the proposed rule accordingly. Other rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 62, 75, 102, 128) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference the ``current'' edition of all of the applicable ANSI standards (i.e., the ANSI standards for eye and face protection, head protection, and foot protection) rather than referencing a specific edition. These commenters stated that this approach would prevent a situation where the OSHA standards would be outdated when the ANSI standards are revised in the future. OSHA notes that it would be improper for the Agency to reference consensus standards as suggested, because such action would illegally subdelegate authority over the content of OSHA standards to the committees responsible for updating the ANSI standards. The Agency will accept eye and face protective devices as complying with this section if they are demonstrated to be as effective as those meeting the specific ANSI standard referenced by the final rule. For example, the final rule is incorporating by reference the 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 for eye and face protection. Eye and face protective devices meeting a subsequent edition of the same ANSI standard would be acceptable to the Agency (and a de minimis violation of the standard) if it could be demonstrated by the employer that they were as effective as those meeting the 1989 edition. In particular, employers would need to establish either that there was no substantive difference between a subsequent edition of Z87.1 and the 1989 edition, or that PPE which satisfied subsequently modified test criteria provided protection equivalent to that provided by PPE which satisfied the 1989 edition. Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 has been revised accordingly. The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been revised so that paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule reflects that approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989. As discussed above, OSHA has also determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of eye and face PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z87.1&hyph;1968) referenced by existing 1910.133(a)(6). To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. With respect to the subject of eye and face protection, Issue 5 of the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412) requested comments and information concerning the use of contact lenses. Specifically, the Agency asked if it should expand its eye and face requirements to cover contact lenses. Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 13, 15, 16) stated that no additional regulations were necessary for the use of contact lenses. Other commenters (Ex. 7: 21, 26) believed that OSHA should address the issue of contact lenses in the final rule, and should clarify if it is permissible to wear contact lenses with eye protection. Several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 107&hyph;D; Ex. 7: 5, 22) stated that wearing contact lenses with appropriate eye protection does not present any additional hazards. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA believes that contact lenses do not pose additional hazards to the wearer, and has determined that additional regulation addressing the use of contact lenses is unnecessary. The Agency wants to make it clear, however, that contact lenses are not eye protective devices. If eye hazards are present, appropriate eye protection must be worn instead of, or in conjunction with, contact lenses. 1910.135 Head Protection Proposed 1910.135 set requirements for the use of protective helmets and set criteria for acceptable equipment designs. Proposed paragraph (a) required employees to wear protective helmets (1) ``when working in areas where there is a potential for injury to the head from falling or moving objects'' and (2) ``where they are near exposed electrical conductors which could be contacted by the protective helmets.'' Proposed paragraph (b) referenced American National Standard, ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, ``Protective Headwear for Industrial Workers-Requirements''. The proposed language was based on existing 1910.132(a) and 1910.135 and on ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. Existing 1910.132(a) requires that the PPE necessary to protect employees from workplace hazards be provided, used and maintained properly. That standard specifically includes head protection under its coverage. Existing 1910.135 facilitates compliance with existing 1910.132(a) regarding helmets worn for protection ``from falling and flying objects and from limited electric shock and burn,'' by requiring that those helmets comply with the American National Standard Safety Requirements for Industrial Head Protection, Z89.1&hyph;1969. ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 is the most recent edition of the pertinent national consensus standard. Proposed 1910.135(a)(1), unlike existing 1910.135, explicitly required the use of protective helmets. The proposed paragraph also made some editorial revisions to existing 1910.135. For example, the proposal replaced ``flying'' with ``moving'', because OSHA believed the term ``moving'' better described the means in which objects contact employees. OSHA used the terms ``flying'' and ``moving'' in the existing and proposed rules, respectively, in conjunction with the term ``falling'' to be consistent with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. A commenter (Ex. 7: 20) stated that OSHA should address lateral impact protection ``since there are substantial injuries that occur from directions other than vertical impact*&blank;*&blank;*\u00a7'' In the course of this rulemaking, OSHA obtained a helmet (Ex. 46) capable of protecting employees against lateral as well as vertical impacts. In addition, NIOSH testified (Tr. 30: 4/3) that, while most blows to the head come from the back, front or side, ANSI Z89.1 1986 addresses only protection for the top of the head. NIOSH further testified: ``Currently helmets are being marketed that provide impact protection to most parts of the head. OSHA standards should encourage the use of these more protective helmets.'' Some rulemaking participants (Ex. 3: 84, 96) expressed concern regarding the use of the term ``moving'' in the proposed paragraph. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 3: 84, pg. 4) stated: API is opposed to the wording of this paragraph. The ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986 referenced in 1910.135(b) contains helmet specifications ``to protect the heads of industrial workers from impact or penetration by falling objects *&blank;*&blank;*'' OSHA must recognize that the ANSI standard does not provide design criteria for moving objects. If OSHA intends this section to also cover helmets protecting against moving objects, as proposed in 1910.135(a)(1), additional design criteria should be cited in 1910.135(b). In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96, pg. 2) stated: Under 1910.135 Head Protection, we find the requirement to provide head protection vague, and welcome additional clarification from OSHA with regard to potential for injury to the head from moving objects. We are concerned compliance personnel will interpret the requirement so broadly as to include any use of hoisting equipment. Although we can envision an occasional situation where there may be a hazard, most operations using a hoist would present no significant hazard. Another commenter (Ex. 3: 40) suggested that OSHA revise proposed 1910.135(a)(1) so that the provision ``Mandates that employers require their employees wear protective helmets when they are in an area where there is potential for injury to the head from falling, moving, swinging, flying or airborne objects .'' The commenter did not state why it believed the recommended language was needed. Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 72, 79) stated that proposed 1910.135(a)(1) should also require employees to wear head protection when working in confined spaces and commenters (Ex. 3: 79, 119) have stated that OSHA should require protection against impacts with fixed objects.. For example, Centel (Ex. 3: 72) noted that injuries may result from contact with low hanging structures and that Centel already requires its employees working in confined spaces to wear head protection. In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (Ex. 3: 79) stated: We believe a statement should be added with provision for protection against impacts with fixed objects. We recommend a sentence should be added that addresses this hazard. We also suggest that in areas that are confined or congested and the employee is subject to impact with fixed objects, suitable protective helmets be worn. We recommend that bump caps should not be used in an industrial environment because there are too many possibilities of head injuries that could occur. We recommend maximum head protection at all times in this type of environment. The current ANSI standard, Z89.1&hyph;1986, addresses only protection ``from impact and penetration by falling objects and from high-voltage electric shock and burn.'' The Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate for 1910.135(a) to cover head protection that is not also covered by the ANSI standard referenced in 1910.135(b), unless OSHA provides criteria for assessing compliance. The Agency has determined that it is not in a position to set such criteria, so OSHA has deleted the term ``moving'' from 1910.135(a)(1) of the final rule and has not added the terms suggested by commenters. The Agency believes that compliance with the ANSI criteria referenced through 1910.135(b) of the final rule will enable employers to protect their employees from a large proportion of potential head hazards. Head protection not covered by 1910.135 of the final rule, such as would be needed to protect employees from ``moving'' or ``fixed'' objects, is covered by the general requirements of 1910.132, as revised. OSHA anticipates that employers whose hazard assessments identify head hazards that are not abated through compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, will develop and implement other measures as necessary, to protect their employees. Proposed 1910.135(a)(2) required that employees who are near exposed energized conductors which their heads could contact must wear helmets designed for protection from electrical hazards. Two commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested that OSHA revise the proposed provision by adding requirements for proper maintenance of head protection. In particular, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (Ex. 3: 36) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) should also require: ``Protective helmets shall be worn and cared for as recommended by the manufacturer. Protective helmets shall not be altered or defaced which would take away the impact and/or dielectric integrity of the helmet.'' OSHA has determined that any employee protection which could result from compliance with the suggested language on maintenance will already be attained through compliance with existing and proposed 1910.132. This section contains requirements concerning defective and damaged equipment, 1910.132(e); and, training requirements pertaining to the maintenance of PPE, 1910.132(f)(1)(v). Another commenter (Ex. 3: 81) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) was unclear, because it appeared ``to require nonconductive helmets for electricians whenever they are ``near exposed electrical conductors'' even if there is no reasonable probability of contact.'' The commenter suggested that OSHA revise the proposed language to require the wearing of protective helmets ``WHEN they are near exposed electrical conductors which their heads could contact.'' The Agency notes that the suggested language is consistent with the description of proposed paragraph (a)(2) in the preamble to the proposed rule (54 FR 33836). OSHA agrees that clarification of the proposed paragraph is appropriate and has revised the proposed paragraph accordingly. Proposed 1910.135(b) required that the design of protective helmets comply with the design requirements of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 or be of a design that provides equivalent protection. Existing 1910.135 references the requirements and specifications established in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. As noted in the preamble to the NPRM (54 FR 33837), OSHA has determined that, except as regards electrical insulation for Class B helmets, the 1969 and 1986 editions of ANSI Z89.1 set essentially the same requirements. The Agency also has determined that Class B helmets currently in use already comply with the electrical insulation requirements of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. OSHA also proposed to allow protective helmets which, while not designed to the specifications of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, were ``demonstrated to be equally effective''. The Agency believed that this performance-oriented approach would encourage innovation and the use of improved equipment. A commenter (Ex. 3: 119) stated that the proposed language allowing protective helmets of a design which has been demonstrated to be equally effective ``is not well defined.'' In addition, the commenter questioned the availability of the means and the personnel to determine if helmets not designed according to ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 were equally effective. The commenter suggested that OSHA delete the language in question and require compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. Another commenter (Ex. 7: 20, pg. 3), in discussing the proposed language ``demonstrated to be equally effective'', inquired: Does this mean or does it include possible _prototype lab tests with field trials _engineering or technical expert evaluation _certification agency assessment _appropriate standard and certification by foreign manufacturer, or certification or testing agency which could presumably satisfy the primary intent for protection of the reference standard. To require a user to develop a new standard or a new certification process for a new product or design already proven elsewhere could void the flexibility intended in the ``equivalency'' clause. OSHA believes that the performance criteria set out in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 7, indicate clearly how employers or the Agency can determine if helmets that do not otherwise comply with the consensus standard are ``equally effective''. OSHA also believes that the performance-oriented language of proposed paragraph (b) allows employers the appropriate flexibility to address their particular safety needs. Another commenter (Ex. 3: 126) stated that ``protective helmets should comply with the performance requirements as well as the design requirements of ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986.'' In the course of evaluating these comments, OSHA noted that there are no provisions specifically designated as ``design requirements'' in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969 or ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. The 1986 edition, in particular, sets scope and purpose provisions; definitions; types and classes provisions; materials provisions; physical requirements; performance requirements; and test methods for protective helmets. The preamble discussion of proposed paragraph (b) (54 FR 33836&hyph;33837) referenced the physical requirements (e.g., the maximum weight), the performance requirements (e.g., impact resistance, penetration protection, flammability, water absorption resistance and electrical insulation) and the test methods (e.g., ``stringent'' test methods for testing of ``Class B'' helmets against high-voltage) of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. OSHA agrees, and intends, that head PPE meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This requirement is stated explicitly in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 2. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 in its entirety and is revising the proposed provision accordingly. The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised to reflect that approval and to provide the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of head PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z89.1&hyph;1969) referenced by existing 1910.135. To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. In the proposal (54 FR 33837), OSHA solicited comments and information concerning bump caps, head protection that was not addressed in existing or proposed 1910.135 and that would not satisfy the criteria of Z89.1&hyph;1986. In particular, the Agency requested information with respect to the appropriateness of addressing this type of head protection in the final rule. OSHA also solicited input regarding the need for regulation of bump caps in Issue 5 of the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412). Some rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 40, 58) have suggested that OSHA establish requirements for bump caps. For example, Sandia National Laboratories (Ex. 3: 58) stated: Currently, there are no Federal standards, regulations, or guidance of any kind with which industry can make proper and adequate decisions on the use of bump caps. Bump caps are not new to the work place. Where the risk of head injury has been determined to be of low probability or result in minor contusions, scraps or cuts, bump caps have been provided. The old adage that ``something is better than nothing'' tends to prevail when industry is forced to make an educated guess. Is the adage true in the case of bump caps? In summary there is a need for Federal time and money to be spent on discovering the pro's and con's associated with bump caps and developing corresponding guidance for their use in the work place. On the other hand, Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex. 3: 119, pg. 3) stated : Kerr-McGee's use of bump caps is limited to areas where there is no potential for injury to the head from electrical contact or from falling or moving objects, but where a hazard may exist due to striking one's head against fixed, low-clearance objects. Kerr-McGee is not aware of any voluntary or consensus standards covering bump caps. If the degree of protection afforded by currently-produced bump caps is determined by scientific studies to be inadequate for their intended use as stated on the products, then OSHA should request ANSI to develop a standard. Otherwise, we do not see the need for additional specifications or standards. Most rulemaking participants ( e.g. Ex. 3: 2, 64, 65, 68; Ex. 7: 22; Tr. 140: 4/3; Tr. 160&hyph;61: 4/3) opposed adding requirements for bump caps to the final rule because they believe that if head protection is needed, then it would be safer to require head protection meeting ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. For example, a commenter from the American Trucking Association (Ex. 3: 64, pg. 5) remarked: For the trucking industry in general, bump caps are not practical. Although they are used in some operations for select job tasks, the motor carrier industry has found little benefit in reducing minor head injuries through their use. In fact, safety personnel from a cross section of the nation's motor carriers recently explained that bump caps can be more of a hinderance than a help; they frequently fall off, and in some instances, they can cause vision obstructions. Another commenter, from the Union Carbide Corporation (Ex. 3: 68, pg. 3), said: *&blank;*&blank;* Union Carbide would not support a provision pertaining to ``bump caps''. Where there is sufficient hazard potential to indicate the need for bump caps, it is safer simply to require that hard hats be used. A commenter from the Amoco Corporation (Ex. 7: 21, pg. 2) stated: We believe that the use of ``bump caps'' has no place in a company-sponsored safety program and therefore do not favor its inclusion in this proposal. OSHA has concluded, based on review of the rulemaking record, that the available data do not support regulatory action regarding bump caps. Therefore, the Agency will neither restrict the use of bump caps nor set criteria for such use. OSHA will evaluate an employer's choice of head protection based on the e hazards to which employees may be exposed. Therefore, the employer's compliance with the requirement for a hazard assessment, in 1910.132(d), is of critical importance. 1910.136 Foot Protection Proposed paragraph (a) of this section required employers to ensure that employees wear protective footwear when working in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, or objects piercing the sole. This proposed provision received a large amount of support from rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59, 64, 67). Many of the rulemaking participants agreed with referencing the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for personal protection, ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, ``Protective Footwear,'' particularly since this standard, unlike the superseded 1967 edition, sets criteria for women's footwear and for puncture resistance. However, two commenters were concerned as to when this protection would be required. A commenter from the American Trucking Association (ATA) stated (Ex. 3: 64, pp. 4&hyph;5): *&blank;*&blank;* in some operations drivers may be exposed to falling or rolling freight hazards, or other hazards presented by nails or other sharp objects. In these cases, safety shoes, non-penetrable soles, or some other type of protective footwear are appropriate. On the other hand, there are thousands of drivers that never handle freight or come into exposure with falling or rolling freight, sharp objects, or any other number of hazards. *&blank;*&blank;* The need to require the equipment must be determined on a case by case basis--taking into account the specific operations, and the specific tasks and hazards of the various job functions. Another commenter, from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), expressed a similar concern with respect to when foot protection is required (Ex. 3: 2): Specialty shoes such as ``electrical hazard'' footwear or ``conductive'' shoes have special requirements that would not permit metal insoles to prevent the puncture. If this requirement is upheld, the current design standards and performance criteria for electrical hazard shoes could not be met. OSHA notes that these concerns are addressed by 1910.132(d), as proposed and as promulgated. That provision requires the employer to perform a hazard assessment. From the hazard assessment, the employer can determine what PPE is needed. As to the example presented by the ATA, if it is determined through an appropriate hazard assessment that an employee is not exposed to foot hazards, the employer would not have to provide this type of protection. As discussed above, the hazard assessment provision allows employers the flexibility to choose the PPE that is appropriate for a particular workplace situation. Regarding the ALCOA comment, OSHA notes that if it is determined through a hazard assessment that electrical workers are not exposed to the hazard of sharp objects puncturing the soles of shoes (which would be the case in many instances), the protective footwear would not have to provide this type of protection. On the other hand, if it is determined through a hazard assessment that employees are exposed both to electrical and puncture hazards, the employer would be required to ensure that employees wear shoes which protect the employees from both hazards. Both the 1983 and 1991 editions of ANSI Z41 set criteria for protection of feet from electrical hazards. While proposed 1910.136(b) required that footwear be designed to either comply with Z41&hyph;1983 or be demonstrated to provide equivalent protection, proposed 1910.136(a) did not explicitly require that employees wear foot protection against electrical hazards. The Agency had intended proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) to be consistent and to reflect the 1983 edition of ANSI Z41. While employers are already required to protect employees from electrical hazards under existing 1910.132, OSHA believes that guidance regarding foot protection against electrical hazards will be clearer and more useful if it appears in 1910.136. OSHA has revised proposed 1910.136(a) accordingly. In paragraph (b) of 1910.136, OSHA proposed that the design of protective footwear comply with the requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, or be of a design which has been demonstrated to be equally effective. Rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59, 67, 72, 105, 118, 123) supported the adoption of the ANSI standard for foot protection (ANSI Z41). Further, several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 67, 82, 84) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference the ``updated'' or ``current'' edition of ANSI Z41. For example, Footwear Industries of America (FIA) (Ex. 3: 67, pg. 2) remarked: FIA therefore agrees with OSHA's proposal to update its personal protective equipment standard for foot protection to comply with the improvements made in the ANSI standard. The Agency should note, however, that the 1983 version of the ANSI Z41 standard may soon be replaced by an updated set of industry standards. FIA suggests that OSHA may wish to await the 1990 version of ANSI Z41 rather than to incorporate a seven-year old, nearly outdated standard into 29 C.F.R. 1910.136. The Agency notes that the 1991 edition of the ANSI standard for foot protection has, in fact, replaced the 1983 edition of ANSI Z41 referenced by OSHA in proposed 1910.136(b). OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to reference the current 1991 edition of ANSI Z41 in 1910.136(b) of the final rule because that edition imposes essentially the same requirements as the 1983 edition, except that the 1991 edition provides more specific performance requirements for resistance to compressive forces and standardizes the puncture resistance testing method. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent ANSI standards and of the protective footwear currently available, that compliance with the referenced requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 will not result in disallowing foot protection that would have complied with the requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1983. As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to provide explicitly for the continued use of foot PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (ANSI Z41.1&hyph;1967) referenced by existing 1910.136. Therefore, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule, and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. A commenter from the Tennessee Valley Authority (Ex. 3: 79) observed that OSHA proposed to incorporate only the design requirements of the referenced ANSI standards and not the selection requirements, guidelines, and other general information contained in the documents. As explained above in the preamble, OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference the ANSI standards in their entirety and is revising proposed paragraph (b) accordingly. The incorporation by reference of the pertinent ANSI standards has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been revised so that paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule reflect that approval and provide the requisite information regarding access to the text of those ANSI standards. 1910.138 Hand protection. Issue 5 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414), requested testimony, comments and information regarding the need for regulation of additional types of PPE. Specifically, the Agency stated that it was considering the appropriateness of promulgating requirements for hand protection (gloves) and skin protection (chemical protective clothing). The Agency's concern with respect to hand protection and chemical protective clothing arose from information contained in the record (e.g. Ex. 6: 2, 3, 4, 5), which indicates that a large number of employee injuries are occurring due to the lack of adequate protection from hand and skin hazards. Additionally, neither OSHA or ANSI currently have criteria for hand protection nor for chemical protective clothing. While OSHA received some information pertaining to chemical protective clothing, most of the rulemaking participants who addressed Issue 5 focused their remarks on gloves. Those rulemaking participants suggested that OSHA provide performance criteria and test methods for gloves and provide better guidance for the selection of gloves. They stated that in many instances gloves are not being worn, and when gloves are worn, they are often the wrong type of glove for the application involved (e.g. Ex. 3: 114; Ex. 7: 33, 38, 42; Ex. 53; Tr. 213&hyph;236: 4/3; Tr. 13&hyph;20: 4/4). For instance, a commenter from the United Steelworkers of America (Ex. 3: 114, pg. 2) said: Protective clothing and gloves: OSHA should also set standards for these items since so many gloves do not work with some chemicals and last longer with other chemicals. Also, a commenter from the Washington State Department of Transportation (Ex. 7: 33) stated: I think that additional language regarding skin and hand protection needs to be added to this section so this type of PPE is not excluded from the selection process. That commenter also submitted suggested language to address hand hazards, and the selection and fit of gloves. Boeing (Ex. 7: 38, pg. 2) commented: Boeing supports the position that additional guidelines related to body and hand protection are necessary in 1910.132. Such guidelines should provide information on the selection of hand and body PPE based on reported experience and industry needs. Such guidance would facilitate the acquisition and use of appropriate PPE and eliminate any uncertainty regarding proper application. A hearing participant from the Occupational Health Foundation testified (Tr. 213: 4/3): Based on our experience visiting plants and working with workers, we believe there's a critical need for language to really spell out the program requirements for effective use of gloves. That participant also remarked (Tr. 215: 4/3): In 1988, occupational skin disease accounted for about one-fourth of all reported occupational illnesses. Even with under-reporting, it's a very serious worker health problem. In addition, a hearing participant from the International Chemical Workers Union testified (Tr. 15&hyph;16: 4/4): I go into a lot of plants throughout the country and site visits and the first thing I do is I look at the OSHA 200 log. I see many cases of occupational dermatitis. My first assumption was these people are not wearing gloves. After further investigation once I'm in that facility, I find out that the workers are wearing gloves, but they're wearing the wrong glove for the application involved. So, this really needs to be addressed. The Agency also received some useful information about the various types of gloves and types of hazards for which they should be used; the composition of the various types of gloves; and, other helpful information (Ex. 3: 27). There were also some informative studies submitted to the record concerning the hand and skin hazards posed by certain chemicals (Ex. 42). After careful evaluation of the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the high incidence of hand injuries, together with evidence that hand protection either is not being worn by employees or is being worn for the wrong type of hazards, warrants the inclusion of more detailed requirements for selection and wearing of hand protection. Therefore, a new section, 1910.138, is being added to the final rule to address hand protection. Paragraph (a) requires that employers select, and that employees use, appropriate hand protection. In addition, paragraph (a) identifies some of the types of hazards for which hand protection must be worn by employees. These include hand hazards and potential hand hazards from skin absorption of harmful substances; severe cuts or lacerations; severe abrasions; punctures; chemical burns; thermal burns; and harmful temperature extremes. Paragraph (b) addresses the selection of the appropriate type of hand protection for the hazard or potential hazard that is present at the workplace. The purpose of this provision is to assure that employees are using the appropriate type of gloves for the tasks to be performed. For example, foundry workers generally must wear gloves that provide thermal protection, while meat cutters must wear gloves that protect against cuts. While the selection of the appropriate type of glove for a certain task or hazard may seem to be obvious, the rulemaking record indicates that many hand injuries have occurred because the wrong type of glove was used for a certain task. Therefore, OSHA has determined that employers need more explicit guidance in determining what hand protection their employees need. The Agency anticipates that compliance with this provision will assure that employees use the appropriate type of hand protection for the assigned tasks and the identified hazards. OSHA has also added information to Appendix B of the final rule regarding the selection of appropriate hand protection. Third party certification In the NPRM (54 FR 33835), OSHA solicited comments on whether or not the Agency should require third party certification of PPE. OSHA indicated that it would consider promulgating such a provision to ensure that PPE meets OSHA standards. In addition, Issue 2 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3413) solicited testimony, with supporting information, regarding the extent to which third party certification of PPE required by Subpart I would be appropriate. The third party certification issue generated more response than any other subject covered by this rulemaking. Many of the participants in this rulemaking supported third party certification (e.g. Ex. 3: 3, 16, 27, 37, 83, 90, 92, 98, 114, 120, 123; Ex. 7: 3, 18, 20; Tr. 55: 4/3; Tr. 92&hyph;97: 4/3; Tr. 6&hyph;7: 4/4; Ex. 49). In supporting third party certification, a commenter from MSA (Ex. 3: 18) stated: In order to provide user companies with assurances that personal protective equipment meets the appropriate standards, we think it would be highly desirable for OSHA to require third-party certification of PPE. We think a program such as the one offered by the Safety Equipment Institute that provides independent testing and quality assurance audits is extremely valuable and adds minimum cost to safety equipment. A commenter from ETL Testing Laboratories, Inc. (Ex. 3: 43) added: Our experience supports the use of third-party certification as positive assurance that the products covered by a program do, in fact, meet the standards to which they are tested, and that follow-up inspections verify that they continue to meet the requirements. Third-party certification programs offer the user of personal protective equipment a positive pledge that the product has been designed and manufactured to provide the protection needed. It further simplifies the selection process by way of readily available lists of complying products and recognizable labels and marks on them. Although we are not prepared to give detailed estimates of costs of third-party certification for the various products, the fees are not burdensome, even on small businesses. The equipment must be tested, whether it is in a program or not; therefore, that cost is present in either case. The administration of a simple yet effective program with follow-up factory inspection would probably not exceed $1,500&hyph;2,000 per year per plant based on some similar programs we operate. Obviously, there are many types of programs, and the fees will vary dependent on the level of services rendered. In supporting third party certification, a commenter (Ex. 3: 103) from the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI) described that organization's certification program as follows: SEI's program of periodic quality assurance audits and product testing is now widely accepted by industry and government. Over two hundred organizations and federal agencies require the SEI certification as a condition of procurement for PPE. SEI combines both compliance testing of product and periodic quality assurance audits of manufacturers' production facilities. These activities are performed under SEI direction by independent third parties to maintain an objective program. A commenter from the Food & Allied Service Trades (Ex. 3: 128, p.4) asserted: We feel that third party certification, akin to that currently required for respiratory protection, should be mandated by the proposed rule. Such certification would guarantee that equipment was thoroughly tested prior to its being relied on to provide safety for workers who may daily, or even occasionally, encounter hazardous situations. A hearing participant from the Industrial Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) (Tr. 136&hyph;137: 4/3) testified: Whether the third party certification is performed by private or governmental entity, ISEA supports its use as a means of confirming the quality of products made for the protection of workers. In the absence of government standards and certification of compliance, ISEA endorses third party certification of compliance with ANSI standard Z87.1, 1989, and Z89.1, 1986. We believe that the additional cost involved for manufacturers of personal protective equipment to obtain certification is minimal, as is reflected by the number of eye and face protection devices and industrial helmets which are already certified by the Safety Equipment Institute. Third party certification costs are averaged over the volume of units sold, and we believe end up as an insignificant cost increase. Other rulemaking participants expressed concerns with the concept of third party certification. One concern expressed by several rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 79, 87, 105) was the belief that OSHA envisioned requiring employers, rather than manufacturers of the PPE, to obtain the third party certification. That was not the Agency's intent. OSHA notes that the manufacturer of the PPE, not the purchaser/user, is, in general, the party who is in the appropriate position to have products tested and evaluated. OSHA's intention regarding the duty of employers was to reaffirm the employer's responsibility to purchase and have employees use only PPE that would meet the requirements of the pertinent standards. Rulemaking participants also expressed concern that it would be very difficult to have third party certification of prescription safety eyewear (e.g. Ex. 3: 60, 71, 93, 115; Ex. 7: 11, 34; Tr. 184&hyph;191: 4/3; Tr. 206: 4/4; Ex. 50). They asserted that third party certification would not be practical since the eyecare providers and prescription laboratories, generally small businesses, who produce prescription eyewear would be unable to bear the burden of third party certification. They also stated that each pair of prescription glasses is unique to the individual for whom it was prescribed. Those rulemaking participants explained that lenses are tested by the manufacturer to meet ANSI standards, and frames are tested to meet ANSI standards by the frame manufacturers. Those participants also expressed the belief that this testing meets the intent of third party certification. OSHA notes that the assurance provided by such procedures may be even better than that obtained through third party certification because each lens and frame is tested, rather than the representative sample of eyewear that would be tested through a third party certification program. For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (OLA), stated (Ex. 3: 71, pp.1&hyph;2): It is the position of OLA that third-party certification of devices utilizing lenses made to individual prescription (Rx) is not feasible, and in fact would not guarantee the safety-level provided by the present system as prescribed by Z87. This is so because third-party certification of all devices would not be practicable, whereas under the present system prescription lenses are subject to a rigorous test and the fabricator of each lens certifies, by its trademark, that the lens meets the standard. It is therefore submitted that the existing system of separate testing of the frame and lenses of spectacles containing prescription lenses meets OSHA's objectives and is practical. Further testing of the completed device after the lenses are inserted would not be feasible. While the test may not cause a device failure, it may damage the lenses and weaken the frame. A commenter from Corning (Ex. 3: 115, pg. 4) said: We do not believe that this [third party testing of prescription eyewear] is practical. Most industrial eyewear today [is] prescribed. *&blank;*&blank;* each prescription pair of glasses is unique to the individual for which it was prescribed and made. The common denominator is that prescription eyewear lenses are 100% tested to pass the industrial eyewear requirements for primary protection, i.e., impact resistance. Further, frames are tested and marked by the frame manufacturer to meet the requirements. Other rulemaking participants opposed third party certification of PPE (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 68, 99; Ex. 7: 1, 8, 39). For instance, the belief was expressed (Ex. 3: 119) that the present voluntary system is adequate, particularly in light of widespread concerns regarding product liability. In general, those opposed to third party certification believed it would add cost, without adding any appreciable safety benefit. For example, a commenter from the American Gas Association (Ex. 3: 46, pg. 13) stated: We urge OSHA not to adopt such a requirement. Such certification would increase unnecessarily the incremental cost of compliance while providing few, if any, benefits. Manufacturers who claim they are in compliance with the ANSI standard could be subject to liability in cases where products fail to meet that standard. The cost of third party compliance would be borne by the industry when the risk of liability should be sufficient to ensure compliance. Another commenter, from the Pacific Maritime Association (Ex. 3: 80), remarked: Third party certification of personal protective equipment by employers would be both costly to the manufacturer and, subsequently, the employer. Additionally, it is not clear in the proposal as to how this requirement would enhance the safety of the workforce. It would place an additional administrative and financial burden on both manufacturers and employers, which does not seem to be justified. In response to the hearing notice, a commenter from the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) asserted (Ex. 7: 31, pg. 2): MVMA strongly objects to the proposal of requiring third party certification for personal protective equipment. We believe that personal protective equipment which meets the requirements of various safety standards such as ANSI and the certification programs conducted by the Safety Equipment Institute are adequate to provide the assurance that the PPE will meet the performance specifications necessary to protect an employee. To require a third party certification will be redundant, costly and will not enhance the safety or performance of PPE. In opposing third party certification, a commenter from Monsanto (Ex. 7: 16) said: [W]e question whether third party certification will add any benefits in terms of protection for employees. It will certainly add to the cost of such equipment. We believe that the manufacturers' written statement that their equipment meets the requirements of the appropriate ANSI standard should be sufficient. Our perception is that this arrangement has worked well over the years and we see no benefit in changing it. OSHA has carefully considered this issue and, after a thorough evaluation of all of the information contained in the record, has concluded for several reasons, that it would not be appropriate to require third party certification. First, while OSHA has recognized that third party certification of PPE can increase confidence in and use of PPE, a requirement for such third party certification will not add to the inherent safety of the PPE tested and certified. Also, given the extent to which the PPE industry has already voluntarily adopted third party certification, the Agency believes that any benefit resulting from the addition of such a requirement would be minimal. Furthermore, revised subpart I provides other means to determine if PPE meets the pertinent standard. In particular, compliance with revised subpart I's performance-oriented requirements for hazard assessment, PPE selection, and training will result in appropriate selection, use and maintenance of PPE by affected employees. For example, the Agency expects that the training required in new 1910.132(f) will increase affected employee confidence in the assigned PPE and, as a consequence, increase the use of PPE. Also, OSHA believes, given the limited benefit expected from third party certification, that it would be unreasonable to require that employers procure only PPE that has third party certification. Such a requirement would impose unnecessary burdens on PPE manufacturers who can establish by other means that their products comply with the pertinent OSHA standards. In addition, the Agency believes that allocating the resources needed to implement and enforce a requirement for third party certification would unreasonably detract from OSHA's ability to enforce the other provisions of revised subpart I. The Agency is also adding non-mandatory appendices A and B to provide additional guidance to employers and employees with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards. IV. Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Assessment of Revisions to Subpart I, Personal Protective Equipment Introduction In 1971, OSHA adopted its current standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) from national consensus standards under section 6(a) of the OSH Act. Since then, advances in PPE technology have resulted in greater occupational protection in workplaces where equipment innovations have been adopted. In this final rule, OSHA promulgates a nationwide standard for PPE that reflects these improved means of hazard prevention. Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be prepared for any ``significant regulatory action''. A ``significant'' rule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires an analysis of whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Finally, section 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides that, where a party has challenged the validity of an OSHA standard in the Court of Appeals, the determinations of OSHA (such as findings regarding the nature and severity of workplace hazards and the feasibility of identified abatement measures) shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. OSHA determined, based on the Agency's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1] and its review of the rulemaking record, that the final rule for General Industry PPE is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of review under Executive Order 12866. However, in order to satisfy the various statutory requirements placed upon the Agency and to further explain why OSHA has classified this regulatory action as ``non-significant'' for Executive Order 12866 purposes, OSHA presents this Final Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Impact Assessment. Industry Profile Based on a report prepared by Eastern Research Group under contract to the Department of Labor [2], OSHA has determined that the hazards addressed by the personal protective equipment standard are present in varying degrees in virtually all workplaces covered by the OSHA General Industry standards (29 CFR 1910). The extent of the rule's impact will vary by industry depending on the hazards, the types of occupational activity and current practices regarding PPE use. Many types of PPE have been in widespread use in industry for many years. However, until recently very little statistical data existed to determine the number of employees who either are using PPE or who should be wearing PPE by virtue of the hazards to which they are exposed. OSHA's inspection data document that approximately 3.5 percent of all planned safety inspections result in citations under the existing PPE standards. The inspection data identifies the standard industrial classification (SIC) of the establishment, size of plant workforce, union status, and information related to the inspection itself; less frequently reported are data on degree of hazard present in workplaces, the number of workers exposed to the hazard, or the type of PPE required. In its Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA examined injury statistics for affected industry sectors. Among the accident databases searched by OSHA were Work Injury Reports (WIR) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). These reports examine cases where a worker was injured and provide evidence that many workers are not wearing adequate personal protective equipment. Based on the BLS data, relatively few firms with serious recordable injury cases have performed a formal assessment of the potential hazards in their workplace. In addition, little training was offered to workers regarding the importance of using protective equipment in these firms. To obtain accurate information on the need for personal protective equipment and the extent to which that need is being met, OSHA conducted a national survey in 1989 [3,4,5]. The survey sampled 5,361 establishments, representing 1.1 million establishments in 61 SIC groups. The survey identified the hazards related to industrial processes and the types of PPE required when working in or near these processes. The survey solicited information on PPE practices and safety procedures and assessed whether engineering controls such as protective guards or overhead nets were in place. Answers to survey questions were used to evaluate the appropriateness of PPE use. Survey questions also addressed PPE training and hazard assessment. (See the background document and appendices in this docket for more detailed information on the survey and supporting data related to this analysis.) Table 1 shows the major industry groups covered by the PPE standard, the total number of affected establishments, total affected employment, number of production employees and number of employees exposed to PPE-related hazards. Of the 16.9 million production workers, the survey identified 11.7 million exposed workers within 1.1 million establishments who should be wearing some form of PPE. These numbers are lower than was indicated in the PRIA, due to a refinement in the analysis regarding affected population. Occupational categories identified by OSHA as having a significant degree of required PPE use include craft, operating, maintenance and material handling employees. These categories encompass most production employees and are most likely to be affected by this standard. However, as noted in the PRIA [1, p. II&hyph;2&hyph;4], OSHA has previously estimated over a million other workers may also be exposed to hazards requiring PPE use in the rest of general industry 1 . 1 As was indicated in the PRIA, while all general industry workers are potentially affected by these standards, exposed workers are heavily concentrated in certain occupations and in certain industries. Building upon information provided for the PRIA and comments to the record, this final analysis focuses on those groups of workers and industries judged to have a heavy concentration of PPE use. In this analysis population at risk was determined by survey results indicating a hazard that required the use of PPE. The PRIA had used the term ``population at risk'' to refer to all workers in two ``production worker'' job categories in general industry [1, p. II&hyph;1&hyph;5]. It should be noted that this analysis in no way implies that other workers may not be exposed to hazards preventable by PPE, but simply that the great majority are found in certain specific job categories and industries.

Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis. Technological Feasibility and Costs of Compliance Technological Feasibility The existing and revised standards for subpart I require personal protective equipment wherever necessary by reason of the hazards of processes, environment or worker activity. New 1910.132(d) requires workplace hazard assessment and new 1910.132(f) requires employee training in the use of PPE. The revised standards for eye and face protection, protective headwear and foot protection update, prospectively, references to pertinent consensus standards. OSHA expects that employers will be able to comply with the new and revised requirements without difficulty, because the means of compliance are readily available and because the final rule ``grandfathers'' equipment that complies with the existing standards. OSHA anticipates that the new requirements for hazard assessment, prohibition of defective and damaged equipment, and employee training can be implemented with available technical personnel and other resources. OSHA's survey probed the extent to which firms have already adopted the elements of a PPE program. Comments in the record were also evaluated in order to establish current industry practices. On the basis of evidence in the record, including results from the OSHA PPE survey, OSHA has determined that the final PPE standard is both technologically and economically feasible. Costs of Compliance OSHA estimated compliance costs using data on current practices and exposed population from the PPE survey. Aggregating costs across industry sectors, OSHA estimates a total annual compliance cost of new provisions in the revised rule will result in a cost of $52.4 million. Total compliance costs by industry sector are presented in Table 3.

(Of 825,265 affected establishments, approximately 47 percent already had a hazard assessment program in place.) The cost to conduct hazard assessments was estimated to be $15.9 million per year, assuming a reassessment is conducted once every five years. The new provision for PPE training would affect approximately 10.8 million employees estimated in need of PPE training, at an annual cost of $36.5 million. Estimates for the cost of providing PPE training differ from those in Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis due to comments received and results from OSHA's PPE survey. This information indicated that the problem of PPE non-usage is considerably more widespread than originally estimated. Correspondingly, this indicated that the population requiring PPE training was larger than originally estimated. Assessment of Hazards and Benefits Injuries OSHA believes that the risk of fatality and injury to workers is unacceptably high among sectors affected by the revised personal protective equipment standard. The revised PPE standard is designed to enhance compliance with existing requirements and ensure future compliance related to a heightened level of hazard awareness and training. These changes to the standard should help to eliminate or reduce accidents within industries subject to the rule. The standard has performance-oriented provisions addressing eye, face, hand, head and foot hazards that allow employers to adopt the most up-to-date PPE for use in their establishment. The flexibility to substitute new materials and technologies should produce more comfortable and protective PPE. An increase in worker acceptance and use of PPE should translate into additional benefits. OSHA's expectation is that increased use of better equipment will prevent or lessen the severity of many incidents. According to BLS statistics in Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1989 [6], there were a total of 1.6 million lost-workday cases and 1.8 million non-lost-workday cases during the survey year. Eastern Research Group [7] analyzed survey-related data, which were used to extract the number of these injuries that were related to use (or nonuse) of PPE. In turn, BLS Work Injury Reports were analyzed to estimate what portion of those injuries related to inconsistent or inappropriate use of PPE, or lack of hazard identification. Injuries prevented in significantly affected industry sectors are shown in Table 4. Since injuries will be prevented in some other industry sectors as well, total estimates are conservative.

These benefits will be gained through selection of more appropriate PPE, increased awareness of hazards and improved consistency in use. These benefit estimates exceed those of the PRIA because OSHA has determined that current compliance with the PPE standards is poorer than was estimated in the PRIA. In addition, OSHA believes these requirements will enhance compliance with existing requirements, thereby preventing more injuries; however, the extent of these benefits are difficult to quantify. 2 Recent research by Arthur Oleinick identifies a possible underestimation of lost workdays when reference periods are bounded by calendar years, as in the BLS survey. For elaboration of this point, see Oleinick [8]. OSHA also estimated the number of fatalities associated with the absence of personal protective equipment. From an analysis of BLS, NIOSH and OSHA accident data, OSHA estimates that 125 fatal head injuries occur annually. While most fatal head injuries are the result of crushing injuries, falls, explosions and other traumatic events beyond the scope of this standard, some are preventable with the use of head protection. Based on a review of OSHA accident abstracts and an understanding of the rule's scope and effectiveness, OSHA estimates that 4 head injury fatality cases are preventable each year through compliance with the new provisions of the standard. Cost Savings Based upon these estimated reduction in injuries, OSHA estimates that society will reap substantial economic benefits from prevented injuries. Lost work time injuries can be particularly expensive. PPE is uniquely effective in preventing eye injuries, for example, which can be severely debilitating. Dr. Leonard Parver [9, pp. 28&hyph;29] of Georgetown University's ophthalmology department elaborated on this cost to employers: These injuries tend to be very devastating. They have severe impact on the patient in terms of vision, and the costs are phenomenal. We estimate the costs of hospitalizing these patients at $250 million per year. That's just for the hospital stay; that doesn't include lost work days and compensation costs. This is a very significant problem, and very, very preventable. We're not talking about reinventing the wheel here. We have the means of doing this. We have adequate eye protective gear. It's a matter of educating the workforce that this is necessary. While employers typically bear only a fraction of the costs related to injuries, these costs can be substantial. Employers specifically will benefit from reduced lost production time, administrative time spent preparing insurance claims and accident reports and replacing injured workers. Based on a 1981 study by Levitt and coworkers [10], OSHA estimates the cost to employers from the average lost worktime injury is at least $4000 3 . This cost includes: 3 Levitt's wage rates were adjusted to reflect current wage conditions in general industry [11]. In light of the National Safety Council estimates presented later in this document, given the debilitating severity of many PPE accidents (eye, head), and the surge in workers compensation costs in recent years, an estimate of $4000 per injury is likely to be conservative. &blank;Administrative cost of handling insurance company claims. &blank;Wages paid to other workers for the time not worked (work interrupted). &blank;Cost of scheduling and funding overtime necessitated by the accident. &blank;Cost to find and train a replacement worker. &blank;Extra wage cost to rehabilitate the returning worker at a reduced capacity. &blank;Cost to clean up, repair, or replace damage from the accident. &blank;Cost of wages for supervision associated with the accident. &blank;Cost for safety and clerical personnel to record and investigate the accident. Other nonquantifiable costs associated with accidents, such as increased anxiety among non-injured workers, the loss of employee goodwill towards the employer, and the impact on public perception of a company and its products were not considered in the Levitt study. Based on the Levitt study and the estimated 37,924 lost workdays prevented, OSHA estimates that the rule will save firms over $150 million annually. However, as noted above, the cost of workplace injuries is typically borne primarily by employees themselves. The National Safety Council recently calculated the societal cost per lost worktime injury at $27,000 [7,p. 35], by factoring in long-term wage losses, medical expenses, administrative expenses and miscellaneous employer costs. Applying this figure to OSHA's estimate of 37,924 lost workday injuries prevented annually, revisions to this rule should save society (employees, employers and third parties) over $1 billion annually. These estimates of the economic benefits of the rule may be conservative, since the benefits analysis focuses on injuries prevented, not reduced severity of injuries. To the extent the rule results in nonlost workday injuries, as opposed to disabling lost workday injuries, the economic benefits may be greater yet. In sum, OSHA estimates the rule will save society over $1 billion annually, dwarfing the initial $52 million investment. Employers themselves should save over $150 million through full compliance with revisions to the PPE standard, approximately three times the estimated cost of compliance. Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis OSHA analyzed the potential economic impact of the revised PPE standard and has determined that none of the major industry groups subject to the standard would experience a significant economic burden as a result of compliance, even before cost savings to employers are factored in. Table 5 presents average compliance cost, revenue, profit, and economic impacts of the standard for establishments in affected industry groups. If all of the compliance costs are passed through to the consumer, OSHA estimates that the average price increase would be negligible, less than 0.001 percent, calculated as the ratio of total compliance cost to industry sales. The maximum price increase in any industry would be less than 0.005 percent. Given the minuscule price increases necessary to cover these safety investments, employers should be able to pass along compliance costs to their customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected firms, the average reduction in profits would be approximately 0.01 percent, the largest being 0.06 percent. OSHA, therefore, does not expect the revised standard to have a significant economic impact on affected firms or industries 4 . 4 In the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA analyzed the entire spectrum of affected industries, and had determined no significant economic impact would result on establishments on any industry, with substantially less impact in those establishments without heavy PPE use. This determination was reached even though the PRIA included costs not directly attributable to the proposal, resulting in a total cost estimate which was nearly twice the cost estimated in this final analysis. Accordingly, OSHA reaffirms that establishments in those industries will incur minimal economic impact.

OSHA has determined that, in relation to compliance with the standard, equipment purchases and labor utilization will to a great extent depend positively on size of workforce; smaller firms are not expected to incur relatively higher costs per worker. As shown in Table 6, OSHA estimates that the average price impact for small establishments will be 0.002 percent, while profit impacts will not exceed 0.04 percent under the assumption that all compliance costs are absorbed by firms. These impacts are judged to be relatively minor; therefore, the PPE standard is economically feasible for small establishments.

National Safety Council, Accident Facts , 1993 Edition. V. Statutory Considerations A. Introduction OSHA has described the hazards that require the use of PPE and the measures required to protect affected employees from those hazards in Section I, Background , Section II, Workplace hazards involved ; and Section III, Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule , above. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the revised PPE standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death. Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that ``the term 'occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.'' In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective safety standards. In International Union, UAW v. OSHA , 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In National Grain & Feed Ass'n v. OSHA , 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective, directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing courts must defer. (See for example, Building & Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock , 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst. , 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification of the agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this rule. Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally, proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing a rule. B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared ``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].'' Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)], based on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].'' ``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business*&blank;*&blank;*. Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan , 452 U.S. 490, 519&hyph;522 (1981) ( ATMI ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' ``[T]he fundamental objective of the Act [is] to prevent occupational deaths and serious injuries [ Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall , 445 U.S. 1, 11 (1980)].'' ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America [S. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1291, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 , (Committee Print 1971) (``Leg. Hist.'') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].'' ``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [ Id . at 324; see also 510&hyph;511, 517].'' [T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses*&blank;*&blank;*. Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. [ Id . at 518&hyph;19 (Senator Cranston)] Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers -- particularly smaller ones -- simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets clear and reasonable limits for agency rulemaking action. OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates `` any permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe -- in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [ Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst. , 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) ( Benzene ); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would a fortiori not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson , [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business.') [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc. , 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the industry)].'' By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for example, ATMI , 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27, 360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 \u03bcg/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 \u03bcg/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 \u03bcg/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29, 245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American Iron & Steel Institute , 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small firms.) All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end ( ATMI , at 514 n. 32; Building and Constr. Trades Dep't AFL-CIO v. Brock , 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See United Steelworkers of Am. v. Marshall , 647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied , 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See ATMI at 2501&hyph;2503; American Iron & Steel Institute generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See Steelworkers , 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.) OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety standards (29 U.S.C. 659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in Benzene at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors. (See Building and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock , 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes. D. The revised PPE standard complies with the statutory criteria described above and is not subject to the additional constraints applicable to section 6(b)(5) standards. Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards. (See National Grain & Feed Ass'n v. OSHA (NGFA II) , 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that all OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5). The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: *&blank;*&blank;* by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational safety. The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer: [The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [ Leg . Hist . at 502&hyph;503 (Sen. Dominick), quoted in Benzene at 648&hyph;49] Additionally, Representative Daniels distinguished between ``insidious `silent killers' such as toxic fumes, bases, acids, and chemicals'' and ``violent physical injury causing immediate visible physical harm'' ( Leg . Hist . at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the more visible and well-known question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' ( Leg . Hist . at 1004). (See also, for example, S. Rep. No. 1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess 2&hyph;3 (1970), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1970, pp. 5177, 5179, reprinted in Leg. Hist. at 142&hyph;43, discussing 1967 Surgeon General study that found that 65 percent of employees in industrial plants ``were potentially exposed to harmful physical agents, such as severe noise or vibration , or to toxic materials''; Leg.Hist at 412; id. at 446; id. at 516; id. at 845; International Union, UAW at 1315.) In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' ( Benzene at 643 n. 48). As Justice Stevens observed: The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances *&blank;*&blank;* was because Congress recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case, the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [ Benzene , at 649 n. 54.] Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example, the Court in International Union, UAW v. OSHA , 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between `health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported the OSHA position ( International Union, UAW at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' ( International Union, UAW at 1313, citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC , 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)). The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust ( National Grain & Feed Association v. OSHA (NGFA II) , 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety. As explained in Section I, Background , Section III, Summary and Explanation of the Standard , and in Section IV, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis , above, OSHA has determined that the non-use or misuse of appropriate PPE poses significant risks to employees and that the provisions of the final rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks. The Agency estimates that compliance with the revised PPE standard will cost $52.4 million annually and will reduce the risk of the identified hazards (preventing 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial reduction of significant risk of material harm for the exposed population of approximately 22 million general industry employees. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates that the PPE required by the standard is already in general use throughout the industries covered by the standard. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs during the standard's first five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs thereafter. As detailed in Section IV, Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and the Table below, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements are consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard. &blank; 1Standard (CFR cite) 1Final rule date (FR cite) 1Number of deaths prevented annually 1Number of injuries prevented annually 1Annual cost first five yrs (mill) 1Annual cost next five yrs (mill) Grain handling (1910.272) 12&hyph;31&hyph;87 (52 FR 49622) 18 394 5.9 to 33.4 5.9 to 33.4 HAZWOPER (1910.120) 3&hyph;6&hyph;89 (54 FR 9311) 32 18,700 153 153 Excavations (Subpt P) 10&hyph;31&hyph;89 (54 FR 45,954) 74 800 306 306 Process Safety Mgmt (1910.119) 2&hyph;24&hyph;92 57 FR 6356 330 1,917 880.7 470.8 Permit-Required Confined Spaces (1910.146) 1&hyph;14&hyph;93 58 FR 4462 54 5,041 202.4 202.4 OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to PPE-related hazards in a large range of industries. The Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis , Section IV, above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised PPE standard in terms of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for the industries regulated. The Agency acknowledges that some industries covered by the revised PPE standard have more documented PPE-related injuries or fatalities than do others. However, the record indicates that the hazards addressed by the standard exist throughout general industry. OSHA does not believe that the significance of the risk associated with exposure to PPE-related hazards within a given SIC classification is dependent on the number of incidents documented for that particular industry sector. OSHA has set the scope of the revised PPE standard to address those situations where employees are exposed to PPE-related hazards, regardless of the relative frequency of incidents. The Agency believes, based on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that employees in the covered sectors face significant risks related to the non-use or misuse of PPE. Therefore, the Agency has determined that all employees within the scope of the revised PPE standard face a significant risk of material harm and that compliance with the revised PPE standard is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from that risk, regardless of the number of injuries or fatalities reported for the SIC code to which the employer has been assigned. In order to facilitate data analysis, OSHA has organized the pertinent injury and fatality information according to the SIC code for the particular industry sectors where incidents have been reported. Given the limitations of the OSHA database and the likelihood of misclassification (due, for example, to the difficulty of classifying contractors), the Agency does not believe that the risks associated with the use or misuse of PPE vary according to the SIC code to which employers have been assigned. OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed PPE standard on their merits in the Section III, Summary and Explanation of the Standard , earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. VI. Federalism This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding Federalism. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) preempts state laws relating to issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid preemption in issues covered by Federal standards only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate commerce they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. The Federal standard for personal protective equipment used in general industry addresses hazards that are not unique to any one State or region of the country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems which might be encountered in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general, performance-oriented terms, there is considerable flexibility for State plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in general industry. Those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard, and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the State standards are at least as effective as that standard. VII. State Plan States The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must develop a comparable standard applicable to both the private and public (state and local government employees) sectors within six months of the publication date of a permanent final Federal rule or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective as'' the new Federal standard. These States and territories are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (plan covers only State and local government employees), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (plan covers only State and local government employees), North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. After the effective date of the Federal final rule, until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these States. VIII. Recordkeeping This final rule does not contain recordkeeping requirements.

Signed at Washington D.C. this 25th day of March, 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary of Labor. PART 1910_[AMENDED] Subpart I_Personal Protective Equipment 1. The authority citation for subpart I of part 1910 is revised to read as follows: Authority: Sections 4, 6, and 8 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 653, 655, 657); Secretary of Labor's Order No. 12&hyph;71 (36 FR 8754), 8&hyph;76 (41 FR 25059), 9&hyph;83 (48 FR 35736) or 1&hyph;90 (55 FR 9033), as applicable; and 29 CFR part 1911, as applicable. 2. New paragraphs (d) through (f) are added to 1910.132 to read as follows: 1910.132 General requirements. * * * * * (d) Hazard assessment and equipment selection . (1) The employer shall assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which necessitate the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). If such hazards are present, or likely to be present, the employer shall: (i) Select, and have each affected employee use, the types of PPE that will protect the affected employee from the hazards identified in the hazard assessment; (ii) Communicate selection decisions to each affected employee; and, (iii) Select PPE that properly fits each affected employee. Note: Non-mandatory Appendix B contains an example of procedures that would comply with the requirement for a hazard assessment. (2) The employer shall verify that the required workplace hazard assessment has been performed through a written certification that identifies the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the evaluation has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and, which identifies the document as a certification of hazard assessment. (e) Defective and damaged equipment . Defective or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used. (f) Training . (1) The employer shall provide training to each employee who is required by this section to use PPE. Each such employee shall be trained to know at least the following: (i) When PPE is necessary; (ii) What PPE is necessary; (iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; (iv) The limitations of the PPE; and, (v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. (2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE. (3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee. Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations where: (i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or (ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or (iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the requisite understanding or skill. (4) The employer shall verify that each affected employee has received and understood the required training through a written certification that contains the name of each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and that identifies the subject of the certification. 3. Section 1910.133 is revised to read as follows. 1910.133 Eye and face protection. (a) General requirements . (1) Each affected employee shall use appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious light radiation. (2) Each affected employee shall use eye protection that provides side protection when there is a hazard from flying objects. Detachable side protectors (e.g. clip-on or slide-on side shields) meeting the pertinent requirements of this section are acceptable. (3) Each affected employee who wears prescription lenses while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in its design, or shall wear eye protection that can be worn over the prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of the prescription lenses or the protective lenses. (4) Eye and face PPE shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification of the manufacturer. (5) Each affected employee shall use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate for the work being performed for protection from injurious light radiation. The following is a listing of appropriate shade numbers for various operations. &blank; 1Filter Lenses for Protection Against Radiant Energy 2Operations 2Electric Size 1/32 in. 2Arc Current 2Minimum* Protective Shade Shielded metal arc welding Less than 3 Less than 60 l7 3-5 60-160 l8 5-8 160-250 l10 More than 8 250-550 l11 s,s,s,s Gas metal arc welding and flux cored arc welding l&blank; less than 60 7 &blank; l&blank; 60-160 l10 &blank; l&blank; 160-250 l10 &blank; l&blank; 250-500 l10 s,s,s,s Gas Tungsten arc welding l&blank; less than 50 l8 &blank; l&blank; 50-150 l8 &blank; l&blank; 150-500 l10 s,s,s,s Air carbon (Light) less than 500 l10 Arc cutting (Heavy) 500-1000 l11 s,s,s,s Plasma arc welding l&blank; less than 20 l6 l&blank; 20-100 l8 l&blank; 100-400 l10 l&blank; 400-800 l11 s,s,s,s Plasma arc cutting (light)** less than 300 l8 (medium)** 300-400 l9 (heavy)** 400-800 l10 s,s,s,s Torch brazing l&blank; l3 Torch soldering l&blank; l2 Carbon arc welding l&blank; l14 &blank; 1Filter Lenses for Protection Against Radiant Energy 2Operations 2Plate thickness_inches 2Plate thickness_mm 2Minimum* Protective Shade Gas Welding: Light Under 1/8 Under 3.2 l4 Medium 1/8 to 1/2 3.2 to 12.7 l5 Heavy Over 1/2 Over 12.7 l6 s,s,s,s Oxygen cutting: Light Under 1 Under 25 l3 Medium 1 to 6 25 to 150 l4 Heavy Over 6 Over 150 l5 * As a rule of thumb, start with a shade that is too dark to see the weld zone. Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum) operation. ** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece. (b) Criteria for protective eye and face devices .

Appendix B to Subpart I_Non-mandatory Compliance Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment Selection This Appendix is intended to provide compliance assistance for employers and employees in implementing requirements for a hazard assessment and the selection of personal protective equipment. 1. Controlling hazards. PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction with guards, engineering controls, and sound manufacturing practices. 2. Assessment and selection. It is necessary to consider certain general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand hazard situations that exist in an occupational or educational operation or process, and to match the protective devices to the particular hazard. It should be the responsibility of the safety officer to exercise common sense and appropriate expertise to accomplish these tasks. 3. Assessment guidelines. In order to assess the need for PPE the following steps should be taken: a. Survey. Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question. The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards to workers and co-workers. Consideration should be given to the basic hazard categories: (a) Impact (b) Penetration (c) Compression (roll-over) (d) Chemical (e) Heat (f) Harmful dust (g) Light (optical) radiation b. Sources. During the walk-through survey the safety officer should observe: (a) sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result in collision with stationary objects; (b) sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury or ignition of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of chemical exposures; (d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light radiation, i.e., welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc.; (f) sources of falling objects or potential for dropping objects; (g) sources of sharp objects which might pierce the feet or cut the hands; (h) sources of rolling or pinching objects which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace and location of co-workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accident data should be reviewed to help identify problem areas. c. Organize data. Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and information for use in the assessment of hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environment to enable proper selection of protective equipment. d. Analyze data. Having gathered and organized data on a workplace, an estimate of the potential for injuries should be made. Each of the basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness of potential injury from each of the hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure to several hazards simultaneously should be considered. 4. Selection guidelines. After completion of the procedures in paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is to: a) Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what it can do; i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.; b) compare the hazards associated with the environment; i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape, radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available protective equipment; c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from the hazards; and d) fit the user with the protective device and give instructions on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that end users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations of their PPE. 5. Fitting the device. Careful consideration must be given to comfort and fit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary protection. Continued wearing of the device is more likely if it fits the wearer comfortably. Protective devices are generally available in a variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure that the right size is selected. 6. Devices with adjustable features. Adjustments should be made on an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the protective device in the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face. In addition, proper fitting of helmets is important to ensure that it will not fall off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep the helmet on an employee's head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonably low force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard). Where manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed carefully. 7. Reassessment of hazards. It is the responsibility of the safety officer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by identifying and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously selected PPE. 8. Selection chart guidelines for eye and face protection. Some occupations (not a complete list) for which eye protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, millwrights, plumbers and pipe fitters, sheet metal workers and tinsmiths, assemblers, sanders, grinding machine operators, lathe and milling machine operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, and timber cutting and logging workers. The following chart provides general guidance for the proper selection of eye and face protection to protect against hazards associated with the listed hazard ``source'' operations.

See notes (3), (9) Glare Poor vision Spectacles with shaded or special-purpose lenses, as suitable. See notes (9), (10). Notes to Eye and Face Protection Selection Chart: (1) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards. Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protective devices do not provide unlimited protection. (2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As required by the standard, protection from both hazards must be provided. (3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). (4) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the requirements for shade designations in 1910.133(a)(5). Tinted and shaded lenses are not filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such. (5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either protective devices fitted with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be worn over regular prescription (Rx) eyewear. (6) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardous environment. It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional hazard to contact lens wearers. (7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas. (8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing may be necessary. (9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). (10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protection only, but are not acceptable eye protection for the sources and operations listed for ``impact.'' (11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash entry. Eye and face protection should be designed and used so that it provides both adequate ventilation and protects the wearer from splash entry. (12) Protection from light radiation is directly related to filter lens density. See note (4) . Select the darkest shade that allows task performance. 9. Selection guidelines for head protection. All head protection (helmets) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetration hazards caused by falling objects. Head protection is also available which provides protection from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important. Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from low-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 2,200 volts). Class B helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from high-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000 volts). Class C helmets provide impact and penetration resistance (they are usually made of aluminum which conducts electricity), and should not be used around electrical hazards. Where falling object hazards are present, helmets must be worn. Some examples include: working below other workers who are using tools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which are carrying parts or materials; working below machinery or processes which might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed energized conductors. Some examples of occupations for which head protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians, linemen, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and logging, stock handlers, and warehouse laborers. 10. Selection guidelines for foot protection. Safety shoes and boots which meet the ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 Standard provide both impact and compression protection. Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal protection should be provided, and in other special situations electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes would be appropriate. Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and, for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavy pipes, all of which could potentially roll over an employee's feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection should be routinely considered are: shipping and receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall installers and lathers, packers, wrappers, craters, punch and stamping press operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, gardeners and grounds-keepers, timber cutting and logging workers, stock handlers and warehouse laborers. 11. Selection guidelines for hand protection. Gloves are often relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals that are capable of causing local or systemic effects following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide protection against all potential hand hazards, and commonly available glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals. Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a particular application and to determine how long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused. It is also important to know the performance characteristics of gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated; e.g., chemical hazards, cut hazards, flame hazards, etc. These performance characteristics should be assessed by using standard test procedures. Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from the manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s) for the hazard(s) anticipated. Other factors to be considered for glove selection in general include: (A) As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective to regularly change cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and, (B) The work activities of the employee should be studied to determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration, frequency, and degree of exposure of the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be applied. With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical hazards: (A) The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in particular, the ability of the chemical to cause local effects on the skin and /or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects; (B) Generally, any ``chemical resistant'' glove can be used for dry powders; (C) For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data are available), a glove should be selected on the basis of the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for solvents to carry active ingredients through polymeric materials; and, (D) Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as to prevent skin contamination. 12. Cleaning and maintenance. It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. For the purposes of compliance with 1910.132 (a) and (b), PPE should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular intervals so that the PPE provides the requisite protection. It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that protects employees from exposure to hazards.

In section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, the 189 HAP are defined as hazardous for the purposes of regulation. Section 112(g) requires control technology reviews for new, modified and reconstructed major sources of these pollutants. Increases in hazardous air pollution emissions from existing major sources are not considered a modification if they can be offset by equal or greater decreases in HAP deemed ``more hazardous''. Furthermore, the HAP ``with no safety threshold of exposure'' may only be offset by other such ``nonthreshold'' pollutants. Therefore, threshold and nonthreshold pollutants must be identified and are subject to offsetting restrictions. The proposed section 112(g) rulemaking contains the EPA's guidance that identifies the relative hazard to human health of these hazardous pollutants and application of that characterization for determining allowing offsets.

ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue regulations requiring disclosure of certain information by persons selling or leasing (leasing includes renting) housing that may contain lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. Under that authority, EPA and HUD propose the following requirements. Sellers and lessors, or any agent acting on their behalf, of most residential housing built before 1978 would be required to provide purchasers and lessees with all information known to the seller, lessor, or agent on the presence of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards, as well as an EPA pamphlet on lead-based paint hazards. In addition, sellers would be required to grant purchasers 10 calendar days to conduct an inspection or risk assessment for lead-based paint hazards before being obligated under any contract to purchase that housing. Finally, the regulation would require that a standard warning, disclosure, and acknowledgement form be attached to all leases and sales contracts involving target housing. The rule would require the completion of these disclosure activities before the purchaser or lessee had become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the target housing. DATES: Written comments in response to this proposed rule must be received on or before January 3, 1995. If persons request time for oral comment, EPA and HUD will consider holding an informal hearing in Washington, DC. Requests for oral comment must be received by December 2, 1994. EPA and HUD will decide whether to hold such a hearing by December 19, 1994. The exact date, time, and location of any such hearing will be made available by telephoning EPA's Environmental Assistance Division at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT . For further information regarding the submission of information claimed as confidential business information (CBI), see Unit XI of this preamble. ADDRESSES: Please submit three copies of all written comments on this joint HUD/EPA proposed rule, including any comments directed specifically to HUD, to: TSCA Document Receipts (7407), Rm. E&hyph;G99, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. All comments on this proposed rule should be identified by the docket number OPPTS&hyph;62130A. In order to reduce the burden on the commenters, receipt of all comments will be centralized at EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Authority This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, [42 U.S.C. 4852(d)]. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act is Title X of the Housing and Community and Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550. II. Background A. Legal Background In 1992, Congress, recognizing the need to control exposure to lead-based paint hazards, passed the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (the Act). The main purpose of the Act was to develop the infrastructure and standards necessary to reduce lead-based paint hazards in housing (section 1003 of the Act). Congress recognized that lead poisoning is a particular threat to children under age 6, and particularly emphasized the needs of this vulnerable population within various sections of the Act. Section 1021 of the Act amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., by adding a new Title IV entitled ``Lead Exposure Reduction.'' Actions under some sections of the Act are to be implemented and administered by HUD, some by EPA, and some jointly by both agencies, often in consultation with other federal agencies. This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Act. Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to jointly promulgate regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in target housing which is offered for sale or lease. Target housing is defined in section 1004(27) of the Act and in Unit V. of this preamble. Specifically, section 1018 requires: (1) Sellers or lessors to provide the purchaser or lessee of target housing with a lead information pamphlet to be developed under section 406(a) of TSCA; (2) sellers and lessors of target housing to disclose any known lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazard in such housing; (3) sellers of target housing to permit purchasers a 10-day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards; and (4) attachment of a lead warning statement to each contract for purchase and sale of target housing. Violation of section 1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties and potential triple damages in a private civil suit. Section 1018 provides that regulations under this section must be promulgated no later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Act and must take effect 3 years after enactment of the Act. Thus, Congress intended that the section 1018 regulations must be published as final by October 28, 1994, and must take effect on October 28, 1995. Although 1018 specified that final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD will not be able to meet this deadline. It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between the promulgation of the final rule, and the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have believed that this year was necessary in order that the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the rule requirements and set up procedures for compliance. For this reason, EPA and HUD believe that the effective date of the rule should be no earlier than 1 year after promulgation of the final rule, even if this occurs later than October 28, 1995. EPA and HUD believe that this interpretation is the one most consistent with Congressional intent. Several related provisions of the Act and of the new Title IV of TSCA, added by section 1021 of the Act, are briefly discussed below to further clarify this proposed rule. The section most closely related to section 1018 is section 406 of TSCA. Section 406(a) directs EPA to develop and publish, after notice and comment, a lead hazard information pamphlet on lead and lead-based paint hazards in the home. EPA has developed the draft pamphlet in consultation with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and published a notice in the Federal Register of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the pamphlet's availability for public review and comment. As required under section 1018 of the Act, the section 406 pamphlet will be given to purchasers and lessees under the EPA/HUD disclosure regulations proposed today. Sections 1004(15), 1004(16), and 1004(17) of the Act generally define lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated dust, and lead-contaminated soil. Congress charged EPA under section 403 of TSCA to issue regulations identifying more specifically the meaning of these three terms, for the purposes of other provisions of TSCA and the Act. Thus, EPA is in the process of defining more precisely what constitutes a lead-based paint hazard, including lead-contaminated dust and lead-contaminated soil. However, EPA and HUD believe that the provisions of this proposed section 1018 rule can be carefully considered on their own merit and independent of decisions made under the section 403 rulemaking. Therefore, EPA and HUD are soliciting public comment on this proposed rule prior to the availability of proposed or final regulations under section 403. EPA and HUD believe the public has adequate information and opportunity to comment on the contents of this proposed rule and on the relationship between regulations promulgated under sections 1018 and 403 for the following reasons: (1) While known lead-based paint hazards must be disclosed, this requirement is only one of a number of requirements for which sellers and lessors of target housing are responsible. Therefore, EPA's definition of ``lead-based paint hazards'' does not change the affected population, although that definition has clear implications for the extent of disclosure. (2) The requirements under section 1018 will apply to all target housing regardless of the presence of lead-based paint hazards in that housing. That is, all owners, sellers, and lessors of target housing will be on notice that EPA and HUD are issuing disclosure requirements, and that they will be required to retain and disclose certain types of information and to allow for the 10&hyph;day inspection period, regardless of whether their housing contains lead-based paint or a lead-based paint hazard. (3) The Act clearly specifies the requirements of this proposed rule. Therefore, regardless of the standards proposed and issued in the section 403 regulations, EPA and HUD do not have flexibility to change the basic provisions specified by Congress. (4) Section 403, on the other hand, does give EPA flexibility to consider a number of factors in developing health-based standards. Comments specifically concerning the implications of EPA's section 403 standards, given the concrete legislative requirements of section 1018, will be most appropriately addressed by EPA during the development of the section 403 rule. Section 402 of TSCA requires that EPA (in consultation with HUD, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services) promulgate regulations to ensure that individuals engaged in certain lead-based paint activities are trained, that such training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaging in such activities are certified. This section also requires that EPA, in consultation with the above agencies, shall develop standards for performance of lead-based paint activities. Pursuant to section 402, EPA is in the process of developing regulations which would require that detailed reports be written at the completion of any lead inspection or risk assessment, whether voluntary or required. Such reports would have to be disclosed as information known to the seller or lessor under the proposed section 1018 disclosure requirements being proposed today. B. Lead Background 1. Lead and lead-based paint . Lead is a soft, bluish metallic element mined from rock and found in its natural state all over the world. Lead is virtually indestructible, is nonbiodegradable, and has been known since antiquity for its adaptability in making various useful items. In modern times it has been used to manufacture many different products, including paint, batteries, pipes, solder, pottery, and gasoline. From the turn of the century through the 1940's, paint manufacturers frequently used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based interior and exterior house paints. Usage gradually decreased through the 1950's and 60's as latex paints (which are generally lead-free) became more widespread. Although the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned lead-based paints from residential use in 1978 (paint currently may not have greater than .06 percent lead by weight) (Ref. 1), HUD estimates that 75 percent of the houses built in the United States before 1978 contain some lead-based paint (Ref. 2). By current estimations, approximately 57 million homes may contain lead-based paint (Ref. 2). Thus lead-based paint may pose a potential hazard to the occupants under some conditions. 2. Lead hazards . Lead affects virtually every system of the body. While it is harmful to individuals of all ages, lead exposure is especially harmful to children, fetuses, and women of childbearing age. Results of recent studies suggest that lead's adverse effects occur at blood-lead levels previously thought to be safe; in fact, there does not yet appear to be a discernable threshold for the adverse effects of lead on the young (Ref. 3). Lead poisoning has been referred to as ``the silent disease'' because its effects often occur gradually and imperceptibly, showing no obvious symptoms. Over time, low levels of lead in the bloodstream can cause learning disabilities, interfere with growth, cause permanent hearing and visual impairment, and cause other damage to the brain and nervous system. In large doses, lead can cause blindness, brain damage, convulsions, and even death. Lead exposure before or during pregnancy can also affect fetal development and cause miscarriages (Ref. 3). In 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services characterized lead poisoning as the ``number one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States'' (Ref. 4). Although the percentage of children with elevated blood-lead levels has declined over the last 20 years with the reduction of lead in gasoline, millions of U.S. children still have levels of lead in their blood high enough to seriously threaten their health (Ref. 5). Lead-based paint poses a health threat through various routes of exposure. Children under age 6 may ingest lead-based paint chips from flaking walls, windows, and doors. Lead from exterior house paint can flake off or leach into the soil around the outside of a home, contaminating children's playing areas. Dust caused during normal lead-based paint wear (especially around windows and doors) can create an invisible film over surfaces in a house. In some cases, cleaning and renovation activities can actually increase the threat of lead-based paint exposure by dispersing fine lead dust particles in the air and over accessible household surfaces. Both adults and children can receive hazardous exposures by inhaling the fine dust or by ingesting paint-dust during hand-to-mouth activities. III. Purpose The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure that families are aware of: (1) The existence of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in target housing, (2) the hazards of exposure to lead-based paint, and (3) ways to avoid such exposure before they become obligated to purchase or lease housing that may contain lead-based paint. EPA and HUD are proposing identical rules to appear in both Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) where other EPA lead rules will appear and in Title 24 of the CFR where other HUD lead rules appear. IV. Scope and Applicability Section 1018 of the Act applies to contracts for sale or lease of target housing as defined in section 1004(27) of the Act. Therefore, this rulemaking would apply to virtually all transactions involving a written contract to sell or lease target housing. EPA and HUD have identified the following several specific areas that would be excluded or where coverage would be limited in the proposed rule. A. Foreclosure Sales EPA and HUD have identified both legal and policy reasons to exclude the sale of properties at foreclosure from the section 1018 requirements. First, when a property is sold at foreclosure, the sale is conducted at public auction by or on behalf of a secured lender, and the property is sold to the highest bidder without any form of arms-length negotiation and without a sales contract. In most of these cases, the lender is not in possession of the property being sold and never has been; the property is controlled by the owner, who is often hostile to the lender and to any potential purchaser. For this reason, the lender (or the party conducting the sale for the lender) is often not in a position to provide a potential purchaser with access to the property for a risk assessment or inspection, nor are they usually in possession of information concerning the existence of lead-based paint, as required by section 1018(a)(1)(B). In fact, lenders typically know very little about the history of single-family properties in their portfolios, and these make up the vast majority of the properties being foreclosed. HUD's experience in foreclosure sales suggests that most properties sold at foreclosure are not sold to private investors or people attempting to purchase a residence for themselves. Rather, the secured lender, acting to protect its security for the defaulted loan, is the successful bidder in nearly all foreclosure sales, purchasing the property at auction. When the lender is the purchaser, the lender will typically attempt to recover its investment by selling the property to a third party and, at that point, the protections of section 1018 would clearly apply. B. Informal Rental Agreements Because this proposed rulemaking only applies to transactions to lease housing which involve a written contract, EPA and HUD have concluded that it should not apply to informal rental agreements which do not involve a lease. Such arrangements, by virtue of their informality, make the administration and enforcement of these requirements extremely difficult. To the extent practicable, however, EPA and HUD encourage individuals engaging in such informal arrangements to obtain available information on lead-based paint before occupying target housing. C. Renewals of Existing Leases EPA and HUD do not believe that individuals would significantly benefit from multiple receipt of previously disclosed information during renewals of existing leases and see no justification for placing repetitive disclosure requirements on lessors. For that reason, renewals of existing leases would only be covered by this proposed regulation if the tenant has not previously received the lead-based paint hazard information required under section 1018. If, however, the lessor becomes aware of additional information about the property concerning lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards during the term of the lease, he or she would be required to disclose this information prior to renewal of the lease. V. Definitions In order to implement section 1018 of the Act, certain terms need to be defined. This section will provide the regulatory definition followed by an explanation of the definition's source. Where possible, EPA and HUD have drawn definitions directly from section 1004 of the Act. In cases where the statute either failed to define terms for the rulemaking or where the definition lacked sufficient detail, EPA and HUD are proposing appropriate definitions, along with an explanation of the reasons for their choices. EPA and HUD are accepting comment on all definitions not taken directly from the statute. Abatement means any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards in accordance with standards established by appropriate Federal agencies. Such term includes: (1) The removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust, the permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead painted surfaces or fixtures, and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil; and (2) all preparation, clean up, disposal, and post abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. This definition appears in section 1004(1) of the Act. In accordance with the development of standards for the performance of abatements by EPA under section 402 of TSCA, EPA may propose modifications to this definition in a separate proposed rule. If such a revision is proposed, EPA and HUD would consider including the revised definition in the final rule for these requirements. The Act means the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550. Agent means any party who enters into a contract with a seller or lessor to represent the seller or lessor for the purpose of selling or leasing target housing. This definition is based on the statutory wording of section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, which states that ``Whenever a seller or lessor has entered into a contract with an agent for the purpose of selling or leasing a residential dwelling of target housing , the regulations promulgated under this section shall require the agent, on behalf of the seller or lessor, to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section'' [emphasis added]. This provision clearly identifies an agent as a party who has entered into a contract for the purpose of selling or leasing target housing. State statutory provisions and common law may vary on the topic of real estate contracts and the concept of agency. In response to this diversity in state law, EPA and HUD propose a definition of ``agent'' which does not seek to differentiate various real estate agent activities. The agencies believe that this proposed definition provides necessary flexibility regarding which parties could be defined as ``agents'' who have entered into a contract to sell or lease target housing and, as a consequence, would be covered by the requirements of this regulation. For example, it is EPA's and HUD's understanding that in many states, it is typical for a seller or lessor to enter into a contract to sell or lease target housing with a licensed ``real estate broker,'' who may or may not perform the actual duties of an ``agent'' associated with selling or leasing housing. In these states, individuals working for the licensed broker, typically called ``real estate agents,'' may perform some or all of the duties of an ``agent'' but may be treated as an employee of the broker or independent contractor. If the ``real estate agent'' were to fail to ensure compliance with the requirements of the rulemaking, the broker would assume liability for that failure, just as if the broker had performed all agent duties themselves. In other states, the real estate agent is considered an independent contractor rather than an employee of the broker, and the agent, rather than the broker, is held liable for negligence under common law. Because of these variations in state law, EPA/HUD propose a flexible definition of agent, one that could include broker and/or agent, depending on the particular circumstance. If state law does not recognize the difference between a real estate agent and a real estate broker, the party identified in the contract, and in any subcontract to perform those duties, would be liable for any failure to comply, regardless of whether they were called brokers or agents. Specifically excluded from the requirements of this regulation, however, would be agents or brokers who operate solely on behalf of the buyer(s) or lessee(s) and who receive all remuneration from the buyer/lessee (so called ``buyers' agents''). This exclusion is based on the language of section 1018(a)(4) which focuses on agents entering into a contract with a seller or lessor. Common Area means a portion of a building generally accessible to all residents/users including, but not limited to, hallways, stairways, laundry and recreational rooms, playgrounds, community centers, and boundary fences. EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to maintain consistency with the definition of ``common area'' proposed in a separate notice in the Federal Register of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), pursuant to the requirements of section 406 of TSCA. This definition is purposefully broad to allow for its use in other EPA and HUD regulations that might also cover commercial and public buildings. Contract for the purchase and sale of residential real property means any contract or agreement in which one party agrees to purchase an interest in real property on which there is situated one or more residential dwellings used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, as the home or residence of one or more persons. This definition appears in section 1004(4) of the Act. Evaluation means a risk assessment and/or inspection. This definition appears in section 1004(6) of the Act. Inspection means (1) a surface-by-surface investigation to determine the presence of lead-based paint as provided in section 302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning and Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], and (2) the provision of a report explaining the results of the investigation. This definition appears in section 1004(12) of the Act. Lead-based paint means paint or other surface coatings that contain lead in excess of 1.0 milligrams per centimeter squared or 0.5 percent by weight or (1) in the case of paint or other surface coatings on target housing, such lower level as may be established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as defined under section 302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], or (2) in the case of any other paint or surface coatings, such other level as may be established by the Administrator. This definition appears in section 401 of TSCA. Title IV of TSCA was added by the Act, and, given the close relationship between the section 1018 requirements and the provisions of TSCA Title IV, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent to use the Title IV definition for section 1018 purposes. Lead-based paint hazard means any condition that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, lead-contaminated paint that is deteriorated or present in accessible surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result in adverse human health effects as established by the appropriate Federal Agency. This definition appears in section 1004(15) of the Act. The exact levels of lead in dust, paint, and soil that would be defined as a hazard will be addressed in a separate rulemaking, mandated by section 403 of TSCA. For the purposes of this rulemaking, however, the statutory definition is sufficient to provide the public with notice to comment on the rulemaking's requirements and structure. Parties who wish to provide comments specifically on what levels of lead in dust and soil (or what conditions or locations of lead-based paint) should be considered a hazard, should do so separately in the section 403 rulemaking process. Lessee means any entity that enters into an agreement to lease or rent target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. This proposed definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act in identifying individuals entering into a contract to lease target housing. Lessor means any entity that offers target housing for lease, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. This definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying entities entering into an agreement to lease target housing. Owner means any entity that has legal title to target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. This definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act relating to owners of target housing. Purchaser means any entity that submits a written offer to purchaser an interest in target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. EPA and HUD are proposing to limit the scope of this regulation to parties that demonstrate a real interest in purchasing target housing, so that sellers or agents representing sellers need not provide all parties who view a property with a 10 calendar-day opportunity to inspect for lead-based paint hazards. This definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying purchasers of target housing. Residential dwelling means (1) a single-family dwelling, including attached structures such as porches and stoops; or (2) a single-family dwelling unit in a structure that contains more than one separate residential dwelling unit, and in which each such unit is used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, as the residence of one or more persons. This definition is provided in section 1004(23) of the Act. Risk assessment means an on-site investigation to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards in residential dwellings, including: (1) Information gathering regarding the age and history of the housing and occupancy by children under age 6; (2) visual inspection; (3) limited wipe sampling or other environmental sampling techniques; (4) other activity as may be appropriate, and; (5) provision of a report explaining the results of the investigation. This definition is provided in section 1004(25) of the Act. Secretary means the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seller means any entity that sells an interest in target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. The term seller also includes: (1) An entity which transfers shares in a cooperatively-owned project and (2) an entity which transfers its interest in a leasehold in jurisdictions or circumstances where it is legally permissible to separate the fee title from the title to the improvement. EPA and HUD have proposed this definition to cover the range of entities and arrangements that may be involved in the ``sale'' of target housing and that the agencies interpret to be covered by the Act. The second part of the proposed definition describes sellers who have legal title to the improvements (residential dwellings) on property that is leased from another person. Target housing means any housing constructed prior to 1978, except 0-bedroom dwellings, or housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in the dwelling). In the case of jurisdictions which banned the sale or use of lead-based paint prior to 1978, the Secretary, at the Secretary's discretion, may designate an earlier date. This definition appears in section 1004(27) of the Act. The Act excludes housing constructed after 1978 since the allowable lead in paint was reduced to .06 percent by CPSC after that date (Ref. 1). EPA and HUD interpret the term ``0-bedroom dwelling'' to mean any dwelling in which the living area is unseparated from the sleeping area. Under this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory units would be exempt from the requirements of the rule unless children under 6 years of age reside or may reside in the unit. EPA and HUD interpret the term ``housing for the elderly,'' to mean retirement communities or similar types of housing reserved for persons 62 years of age or older. EPA and HUD request comment on what additional specificity might be necessary for identifying housing for the elderly. EPA and HUD also considered whether Congress meant to include hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging facilities in the term ``housing.'' Most hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging are 0-bedroom dwellings, and would typically be exempt from the requirements of this proposed rule. In addition, EPA and HUD believe it is reasonable to interpret that Congress' intent was to distinguish residential housing from commercial lodging facilities. Specifically, the definition of target housing intended to capture housing designed for long-term or continuous residence, as opposed to lodging facilities offering temporary accommodations. Given the high frequency and short duration of transactions, EPA and HUD believe it is impractical to apply the requirements of this proposed rule to rental transactions in motels, hotels, and other commercial lodging facilities. As directed in the statute, the exclusions for 0-bedroom dwelling, elderly housing, and handicapped housing do not apply to any housing in which children under 6 years old reside or are expected to reside. Similarly, in cases where families with children under 6 might enter into a contract to purchase or lease commercial housing as long-term residences, however, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent with the statute that such establishments be considered target housing under this proposed rule's requirements. 0-Bedroom dwelling means any residential dwelling in which the living area is unseparated from the sleeping area. EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to clarify the term used in the Act's definition of target housing. Under this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory units would be considered 0-bedroom dwellings. VI. Proposed Regulatory Requirements Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to promulgate joint regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in target housing which is offered for sale or lease. Specifically, section 1018 requires that before purchasers or lessees become obligated under any purchase or lease contract, sellers or lessors must provide the purchaser or lessee with a lead information pamphlet (being developed by EPA under TSCA section 406) and disclose any lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards known to the seller or lessor in such housing. In addition, before obligating purchasers under a contract to purchase the housing, sellers must permit purchasers a 10-day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards, and must attach a specific lead warning statement and acknowledgement, signed by the purchaser, to each contract. Violation of Section 1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties, and potential triple damages in a private civil suit. In this unit, EPA and HUD present a more detailed discussion of these requirements as proposed in the EPA and HUD regulations. As noted above, EPA and HUD are proposing joint and equivalent regulations that would appear in Title 40 of the CFR with other EPA lead regulations and in Title 24 of the CFR with other HUD lead regulations. Including the joint regulations in both CFR locations will help ensure that sellers, lessors, agents, buyers, and lessees are informed of their existence. A. Disclosure Requirement Section 1018(a)(1)(B) of the Act requires the seller or lessor of target housing to provide all information known to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to the purchaser or lessee before the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease target housing. EPA and HUD are proposing such a disclosure requirement in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. Under the proposed regulations, the seller or lessor, or the agent acting on behalf of the seller or lessor, is required to provide the purchaser or lessee with written documentation of all information known to the seller or lessor, or the agent regarding the presence of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards associated with the housing being sold or leased. Consistent with the statute, records of this information must be provided to the purchaser or lessee before they become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the target housing. For the purposes of this proposed rule, EPA and HUD propose that ``information known to the seller or lessor'' comprise, at minimum, the information described in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107 of these regulations. The proposed information would include, but not be limited to, the following items: 1. Reports from all lead-based paint inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities known to the seller or lessor and conducted on or in the target housing, including any known reports completed before the effective date of the final rule if such reports are available to the seller or lessor on or after the effective date. Section 1018(a)(1)(B) requires sellers or lessors of target housing to ``provide to the purchaser or lessee any lead hazard evaluation report available to the seller or lessor.'' EPA and HUD recognize that reports from some lead-based paint activities conducted before the effective date of the final rule may no longer be available to the seller or lessor given that the seller or lessor had not been put on notice that disclosure of such records would be required. However, those reports in the possession of the seller or lessor on or after November 2, 1994 would become part of the permanent record for that unit of target housing. 2. Records of lead-based paint inspections, assessments, and abatement activities conducted for current or past sellers or lessors in common areas of target housing containing more than one residential dwelling. EPA and HUD are concerned that lead-based paint in common areas may pose an additional exposure risk to occupants, especially in buildings where lead-based paint chips and dust are allowed to accumulate. Also, the presence of lead-based paint in common areas of buildings containing target housing may signal the presence of lead-based paint within the residential dwellings. For these reasons, EPA and HUD are proposing to require the disclosure of records and reports of lead-based paint in common areas. 3. Information known to the seller or lessor regarding whether other residential dwellings in the target housing contain or have contained lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. This would only apply to target housing containing more than one residential dwelling, and would be of primary value in cases where information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards only exists for some, but not all residential dwellings. The presence of lead-based paint in some of the residential dwellings may suggest a greater likelihood of lead-based paint existing in the residential dwellings that have yet to be tested. To balance the indirect value of the information with the disclosure burden of providing such information during transactions, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers/lessors disclose only whether or not lead-based paint is or has been present in other residential dwellings within the target housing, rather than requiring that sellers and lessors provide specific reports on those residential dwellings. The seller or lessor would, of course, retain the option of providing more detailed information, but would not be required to provide specific data on each residential dwelling. EPA and HUD believe that such information will help potential occupants make more informed decisions when considering leasing or purchasing target housing. For example, such information could persuade purchasers to exercise their option to conduct an inspection or risk assessment before purchasing the property. Similarly, knowledge of lead-based paint on the premises could prompt lessees to take greater precautions to guard against exposure. EPA and HUD request comment on whether requiring disclosure of information regarding other residential units is warranted and, if so, whether a more stringent disclosure standard is needed. 4. Other available information that may indicate lead-based paint or a lead-based paint hazard in the unit. This proposed requirement is directed at other relevant information on lead-based paint hazards that may be known by the seller or lessor. EPA and HUD request information and comment on other appropriate information that may be commonly available to owners of target housing and which should be itemized in the final rule. For example, should information on past cases of lead-poisoning of occupants be disclosed to purchasers or lessees? If such information is to be considered, what level of detail would be appropriate given the privacy implications of medical records? In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether the final rule should impose specific recordkeeping requirements on owners of target housing to retain information known to the owner on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards, as identified in proposed 24 CFR 35.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. If promulgated, the time period for such a recordkeeping requirement for owners of target housing could range in length from the length of ownership to a discrete number of years (3 years, 5 years, 10 years, etc), based on its feasibility and utility in ensuring compliance with the regulations. In evaluating the value of an owner record retention requirement, EPA and HUD will consider its potential value both in aiding and supporting Agency enforcement efforts as well as its potential value in supporting civil actions for damages taken under section 1018(b)(3). B. Lead-Hazard Information Pamphlet Section 1018(a)(1)(A) requires that sellers and lessors of target housing provide the purchaser or lessee with a copy of the EPA pamphlet Lead Paint: Protect Your Family before the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the housing. A primary function of the pamphlet is to educate families on the potential health risks associated with lead exposure and ways to avoid such exposure. By requiring that families receive the pamphlet at the beginning of the real estate transaction, Congress ensured that families would be informed about lead-based paint issues during the transaction process. Therefore, the joint provisions of these regulations (located in \u00a7\u00a738.20(a) and 745.107(a) of the proposed regulatory text) would require that purchasers and lessees receive the pamphlet before becoming obligated under any contract. The draft pamphlet was developed by EPA in consultation with HUD and CDC and was released to the public for a 60&hyph;day comment period and announced in the Federal Register of March 9, 1994, (59 FR 11119). In addition, EPA has conducted a series of focus tests and interviews in different regions of the country to ensure that the pamphlet meets both high technical and editorial standards. The final pamphlet will be made available to the public through the Government Printing Office (GPO) for a nominal fee. In addition, EPA will make a limited number of camera-ready copies of the final pamphlet available to organizations that wish to print copies for private distribution, and the pamphlet will be available in electronic form through the GPO Bulletin Board. EPA and HUD are continuing to explore methods for printing and distributing the pamphlet in a quick and inexpensive way to the regulated community and the general public at large. EPA and HUD welcome comment on other potential distribution methods for the pamphlet. C. Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form In addition to requiring written documentation of the information known by the seller or lessor, defined in proposed 24 CFR 38.20(b) and 40 CFR 745.107(b) of the regulatory text, EPA and HUD have developed disclosure and acknowledgement forms to be attached to all sales and leasing contracts for target housing. Form A for sellers and Form B for lessors are included as Appendix A to the proposed HUD regulatory text. EPA and HUD believe that the forms will help ensure that (1) All information known to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards is disclosed and documented, (2) all purchasers and lessees are aware of their rights under the provisions of section 1018, and (3) sellers, lessors, and agents are aware of their obligations under their rule. In addition, these forms would be an important enforcement tool by providing a record of compliance with the rule. By maintaining completed forms after a transaction to purchase or lease target housing, the seller, lessor, and agents would have documentation of their compliance with the disclosure activities and of the purchaser's/lessee's receipt and acknowledgement. Because sellers and lessors have different obligations under the requirements mandated by section 1018, EPA and HUD believe that it is appropriate to provide two separate and distinct forms for the two types of transactions. EPA and HUD initially considered including the elements in the forms as separate provisions for inclusion in the leasing or purchase contracts themselves. Ultimately, that concept was rejected because it would be more burdensome and confusing. By creating one form covering all regulated parties for each type of transaction, EPA and HUD hope to minimize confusion over the new requirements, decrease the recordkeeping burden, and ensure a greater level of compliance. 1. Form for Transactions to Sell Target Housing For the reasons discussed above, EPA and HUD are proposing in \u00a7\u00a7745.107(a)(4) and 38.20(a)(4), respectively, that each contract to sell property defined as target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form entitled Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Sale . The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement by the seller, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement by the purchaser. Each part is discussed below. a. Notice to purchasers of target housing . Section 1018(a)(3) of the Act provides a specific ``lead warning statement'' to be included in all contracts involving the purchase and sale of any interest in target housing. The statute states that the lead warning statement shall contain the required language printed in large type on a separate sheet of paper attached to the contract. Because the disclosure and acknowledgement form would serve as an attachment to the contract, EPA and HUD propose to include this lead warning statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence. The required text would read: Every purchaser of any interest in residential real property on which a residential dwelling was built prior to 1978 is notified that such property may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint that may place young children at risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children may produce permanent neurological damage, including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The seller of any interest in residential real property is required to provide the buyer with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments or inspections in the seller's possession and notify the buyer of any known lead-based paint hazards. A risk assessment or inspection for possible lead-based paint hazards is recommended prior to purchase. In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the sales contract is written in a language other than English, the lead warning statement must be included in the language of the contract as well, based on a translation of the English-version lead warning statement. While this is not expressly required by the statute, such a requirement would be consistent with Congress' intent of ensuring that families be fully aware of the potential hazards of lead-based paint before purchasing target housing. EPA and HUD request comment on this proposed requirement. b. Certification of compliance statement by the seller . The second part of the form would require the seller to list all information known to the seller on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. EPA and HUD believe that it is necessary to create a single record of the information provided by the lessor/owner. Completion of this part would ensure that at the time of the contract agreement, both the seller and the purchaser would be aware of the disclosure requirements under these regulations and the lead-based paint hazard information being disclosed. If information described in Part II of the form is in the possession of the seller, the seller would be required to provide the information in written form to the purchaser, check the appropriate box, and note the dates and type of known information in the space provided. This information would be a necessary record during the disclosure process, both to inform the purchaser of the information the purchaser should have received, and as a later measure of compliance by the seller and the seller's agent. c. Certification of compliance statement by the agent . The third part of the form would require an agent, if one is used, to certify that the requirements of section 1018 have been satisfied, either by the seller or by the agent. d. Acknowledgement of lead-based paint requirements in target housing by the purchaser . Section 1018(a)(2) requires that contracts to purchase target property include an acknowledgement signed by purchasers. EPA and HUD propose that the purchaser indicate the following in the acknowledgement: That they have read and understood the lead warning statement, received any information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards noted in the seller certification, received a lead hazard information pamphlet, and that they are aware that they must receive an opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the property. In the fourth part of the form, EPA and HUD propose such an acknowledgement. The acknowledgement would state: I acknowledge that I have read and understood the attached lead warning statement in Part I of this form, received the information noted in Part II of this form, received the lead hazard information pamphlet Lead-Based Paint: Protect Your Family . In addition, I acknowledge that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4852(d) and its implementing regulations, the attached contract entitles me to up to 10 calendar days to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase, unless I agree otherwise in writing. 2. Form for Transactions to Lease Target Housing EPA and HUD are proposing in \u00a7\u00a7745.107(a)(5) and 38.20(a)(5), respectively, that each contract to lease target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form entitled Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Lease. The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement by the lessor, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement by the lessee. Each part is discussed below; however, where statutory justifications and background are the same as that presented in the part on the form for sales of target housing, the repetitive elements have been omitted. a. Notice to residents of target housing . EPA and HUD propose to include a tailored lead warning statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence. Although not specifically required by section 1018, EPA and HUD believe that this statement provides a useful context for information disclosed to lessees, just as for purchasers, concerning the hazards of lead-based paint. The required text would read: A residential structure built prior to 1978 may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint. This exposure may place young children at risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children can produce permanent neurological damage, including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The lessor of any residential dwelling is required to provide the lessee with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments or inspections in the lessor's possession and notify the lessee of any known lead-based paint hazards. In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the lease is written in a language other than English, a translation of this lead warning statement would be required to be attached in the language of the contract. EPA and HUD believe that this translation requirement may be even more critical in the case of leasing transactions than in purchases as many non-English speakers may be more likely to lease housing for themselves and their families. EPA and HUD request comment on this proposed requirement. b. Certification of compliance statement by the lessor . The second part of the form would require the lessor to list all information known to the lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. If information listed in Part II of the form is in the possession of the lessor, the lessor would be required to provide it in written form to the lessee, check the appropriate box, and note the dates and type of known information in the space provided. c. Certification of compliance statement by the agent . The third part of the form would require an agent, if one is used, to certify that the requirements of section 1018 have been satisfied, either by the lessor or by the agent. d. Acknowledgement of lead-based paint requirements in target housing by the lessee . The fourth part of the form consists of an acknowledgement by the lessee that the necessary disclosure steps, as required by section 1018(a)(1), had been performed. The acknowledgement language reads: I acknowledge that I have read and understood the attached lead warning statement in Part I of this form, received the information noted in Part II of this form and received the lead hazard information pamphlet Lead Paint: Protect Your Family 3. Request for Comment on the Forms EPA and HUD request comments on all aspects of the disclosure and acknowledgement forms. Specific questions include: Are the forms effective in communicating the importance of lead-based paint hazard awareness and the rights of purchasers and lessees? Is there other information that should be included on the forms? Is some of the included information that is not required by the statute unnecessary? 4. Retention of Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form The disclosure and acknowledgement form documents the fulfillment of the mandated disclosure requirements during the sale or lease of target housing. This record, if maintained by the seller or lessor after the completion of the transaction, would provide a valuable record of the fulfillment of these requirements to both the agencies and courts. If this record were not regularly maintained, EPA and HUD are concerned that they would have little ability to determine whether the necessary disclosure steps had occurred. For that reason, proposed \u00a7\u00a738.20 and 745.107 of the regulatory text would require that the signed notice and disclosure form be maintained by sellers, lessors, and agents for a full 3 years from: (a) The commencement of the lease period in the case of a transaction to lease target housing, or (b) the completion of the sale in the case of a sale of target housing. EPA and HUD chose 3 years as the retention period for the disclosure form in order to allow adequate time for enforcement action by HUD or EPA. If the regulation were to mandate a shorter period of time, Federal enforcement actions could be hampered, undermining the efficacy of the regulations mandated by statute. EPA and HUD are concerned that requiring a longer retention period would place an undue burden on the regulated community. EPA and HUD have not identified any less burdensome alternative to support compliance monitoring and enforcement actions but are sensitive to the need to impose minimum recordkeeping burdens on the regulated community, especially given the large number of transactions affected. The agencies are willing to consider alternatives to the proposed requirements, including the reduction or omission of recordkeeping requirements, if the alternatives would still ensure the successful administration and enforcement of the provisions of section 1018 of the Act. Such alternatives could include the imposition of a longer or shorter retention period for the disclosure form, or the addition or substitution of other records as part of a post-transaction recordkeeping requirement. EPA is also considering the potential efficacy of instituting recordkeeping requirements with a sunset provision, which would phase them out over time as the market increasingly embraced and institutionalized the disclosure process. Regardless of what recordkeeping time limits the agencies impose, these limits would not effect time limits on lawsuits under section 1018(b)(3) by injured parties against former sellers, lessors, or agents who fail to comply with these regulations. For this reason EPA and HUD would encourage sellers, lessors, and agents to maintain signed, dated forms beyond the required recordkeeping period as proof of compliance. D. 10-Day Inspection Period Section 1018(a)(1)(C) of the Act requires that, before a party is obligated under any contract to purchase target housing, the seller shall grant the purchaser a 10&hyph;day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards in target housing. EPA and HUD interpret the term ``10&hyph;day period'' to mean 10 calendar days. While the seller and purchaser may mutually agree to a shorter or longer period, without written proof of an agreed upon change to the time, the legally enforceable period would remain 10 calendar days. Given the diversity of definitions for ``business'' or ``working'' days, EPA and HUD believe that an alternative interpretation of the 10&hyph;day period would lead to confusion among the public. In cases where a 10 calendar-day inspection or assessment period would be insufficient, the purchaser would retain the option of negotiating in writing for a longer period. Since known lead-based paint information may affect a purchaser's decision to utilize the 10&hyph;day inspection period option, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers perform and document all disclosure activities required under this proposed rule before providing the purchaser with the opportunity for the 10&hyph;day period. EPA and HUD believe that the purchaser will be most able to determine whether a risk assessment or inspection is necessary or appropriate after receiving the disclosed information. EPA and HUD also believe that reports from inspections conducted during the 10&hyph;day inspection/assessment period should become part of the permanent record retained by the owner of the housing. Therefore, EPA and HUD are also requesting comment on whether purchasers who conduct inspections or risk assessments during the 10&hyph;day period but who do not ultimately purchase the housing should be required, under this rulemaking, to provide a copy of any report to the owner for their records. Some purchasers and sellers may prefer to conduct the 10&hyph;day inspection/assessment period before the parties have signed a contract for the purchase and sale of the target housing. Others may prefer to conduct the inspection period after the contract is signed. In implementing these requirements, EPA and HUD have considered several approaches to fulfilling the statutory provision that the purchaser receive the opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the housing. These regulations propose several approaches to Federal implementation of the 10&hyph;day inspection period. Option 1. Require Contract Language Addressing Outcome of Inspection (Preferred Option) To insure that the purchaser receives the statutorily required 10&hyph;day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment or inspection before becoming obligated under the contract, the proposed regulation (24 CFR 38.21 and 40 CFR 745.110) requires that, if the parties elect to ratify the contract prior to completion of the 10&hyph;day opportunity, the seller or agent must include appropriate language in the contract to reflect that the contract shall be contingent on the condition that no lead-based paint hazard is found in the inspection or risk assessment. If a lead-based paint hazard is found during the inspection or risk assessment, the seller and purchaser would mutually determine the terms under which the sale will or will not proceed. Option 2. Base Regulatory Text on Statutory Language The least prescriptive option for implementing section 1018(a)(1)(C) requirement for a 10&hyph;day inspection opportunity is to state in the regulation simply that ``the seller shall provide the purchaser with an opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period (unless the parties agree to a mutually agreed upon different period of time) before becoming obligated under the contract to purchase the housing to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards.'' While this option would provide the regulated community with flexibility in determining how to comply, EPA and HUD are concerned that the lack of detail would provide inadequate guidance to the regulated community, regarding the measures needed for proper compliance. Option 3. Mandate Specific Contingency Language for All Contracts Completed Before Inspection or Assessment Period EPA and HUD are considering the merit of requiring that all contracts to purchase target housing include specific language mandated by HUD and EPA addressing the purchaser's opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period. In addition to further informing the purchaser of his/her rights to the inspection/assessment period, EPA and HUD could provide specific language addressing the rights of the purchaser in cases where the inspection/assessment period was provided after the purchaser had signed a contract to purchase the target housing. These requirements have the advantage of providing a clear message regarding what the seller and agent must do to comply and regarding what rights the purchaser has in cases where the purchaser does not receive the inspection or assessment period until after having signed a contract. Option 4. Require the Inspection/Assessment Period Before the Contract is Signed EPA and HUD also requests comment on requiring that the 10&hyph;day opportunity for inspection or assessment be provided before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of target housing. This would ensure that all purchasers were aware of the presence of any lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards before they entered into the contract to purchase the housing. EPA and HUD do not currently prefer to impose such a prescriptive requirement on the real estate community; however, recognizing that both purchasers and sellers may prefer, at times, to implement the inspection period after all parties have acknowledged serious interest in completing the transaction. In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether more prescriptive regulations would be of value regarding exactly what level or conditions of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards would allow for purchasers to escape their obligation under a contract signed before the inspection. Alternatively, the agencies would also like comment on whether the regulatory language and safeguards being proposed may be overly prescriptive regarding implementation of the 10&hyph;day opportunity. E. Role of Agent As set forth in section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, agents entering into a contract with a seller or lessor to sell or lease target housing must ensure compliance with all requirements imposed upon the seller or lessor under section 1018. If the sale or lease of target housing was aided or accomplished by an agent who has entered into a contract with a seller or lessor, the agent can be held liable for their failure to comply with the requirements of section 1018 and the regulations and can be liable for all penalties, both criminal and civil. EPA and HUD propose to impose an affirmative obligation on agents to advise the seller of the provisions of the rule, including the seller's obligation to inform the agent of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. The language of the disclosure form reflects this notification requirement. As a method for demonstrating compliance, EPA and HUD have proposed a requirement that agents sign and maintain copies of the signed notice and disclosure forms from each sale or lease of target housing. As proposed for sellers and lessors, the agent would have to maintain these records for 3 years from the commencement of the leasing period or for 3 years from the completion of the sale. In determining an appropriate recordkeeping requirement, EPA and HUD considered both the burden on the regulated community and the information and duration necessary to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement of the rule's provisions. EPA and HUD rejected the ``no-recordkeeping requirement'' for agents because it would hinder Federal compliance assurance activities and make it difficult to determine whether a disclosure had taken place. Similarly, a recordkeeping requirement of less than 3 years would provide inadequate time for inspection of records and initiation of appropriate enforcement actions. If no agents were employed during the leasing or purchasing process, then all liability for failure to adhere to the proposed requirements would rest solely with the seller or lessor. EPA and HUD request comment on the rule's proposed definition of agent (see Unit IV of the preamble and \u00a7\u00a738.15 and 745.103 of the regulatory text) and on the interpretation of their compliance assurance provision in section 1018(a)(4). F. Effective Date Section 1018(a)(1) of the Act directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue these requirements as final regulations by October 28, 1994, and pursuant to section 1018(d), the regulations will take effect on October 28, 1995. Although section 1018 specified that final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD will not be able to meet this deadline. It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between the promulgation of the final rule, and the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have felt that this year was necessary in order that the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the rule requirements and set up procedures for compliance. For this reason, EPA/HUD believe that the effective date of the rule should be no early than 1 year after promulgation of the final rule, even if this means occurring later than October 28, 1995, as mandated by section 1018. EPA and HUD believe that this interpretation is the one most consistent with Congressional intent. VII. Non-Compliance and Penalties In addition to civil liability under section 1018(b)(3), section 1018 provides both EPA and HUD with other enforcement authority for these requirements. The enforcement authority is discussed below. A. HUD Authority Section 1018(b)(1) of the Act authorizes HUD to impose civil monetary penalties on any person who knowingly violates section 1018. HUD interprets this authority to apply to violators of the regulations under section 1018 as well. HUD shall impose penalties under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 [42 U.S.C. 3545]. These penalties may be up to $10,000 for each violation. In addition, section 1018(b)(2) of the Act authorizes the Secretary of HUD to ``take such lawful action as may be necessary to enjoin any violation'' of the rule's provisions. Section 1018(b)(5) provides that any violation of section 1018 will be a violation of section 409. Section 412(a) of TSCA provides that the U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to restrain any violation of section 409 of TSCA. Thus, the district courts will have jurisdiction over violations of section 1018. B. EPA Authority 1. Civil Section 1018(b)(5) of the Act provides that failure or refusal to comply with section 1018 or its implementing regulations is a violation of TSCA section 409. Violations of TSCA section 409 are subject to TSCA section 16 penalties. Thus, a violator of section 1018 will be subject to penalties under TSCA section 16 of up to $10,000 for each violation. 2. Criminal Since TSCA section 16 includes violations under section 409, TSCA section 16(b) provides that any person who knowingly or willfully violates section 409 (and thus section 1018) would, in addition to or instead of any civil penalty, be subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $10,000 for each day of violation or to imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. As violations of each provision can only occur one time during each transaction (as opposed to on a daily basis), the $10,000 penalty may be interpreted as ``for each violation.'' C. Civil Liability In addition to the EPA and HUD enforcement authority for the provisions of this proposed rule, under section 1018(b)(3) of the Act, ``Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of this section shall be jointly and severally liable to the purchaser or lessee in an amount equal to 3 times the amount of damages incurred by such individual.'' This provision allows the purchaser or lessee to seek direct compensation for any damages incurred based on the seller or lessor's noncompliance. Section 1018(b)(4) authorizes the court to award court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and expert witness fees to the plaintiff if the plaintiff prevails. D. Validity of Contracts and Liens Section 1018(c) provides that nothing in section 1018 (or implementing rules) shall affect the validity or enforceability of any sale or contract for the purchase and sale or lease of any interest in residential real property or any loan, loan agreement, mortgage, or lien, made or arising in connection with a mortgage loan.'' It also provides that nothing in section 1018 (or its implementing rules) shall ``create a defect in title.'' EPA and HUD have looked at section 1018(c) in the context of other section 1018 provisions, which outline specific clauses which must be attached to contracts for the purchase and sale of target housing, and specific procedural protections which must be given to the purchaser/lessee. EPA and HUD interpret section 1018 as a whole to provide that, once the contract is ratified, if certain attachments are not included in the ratified contract and if certain protections afforded in section 1018 were not given to the lessee/purchaser, the remedy available to the purchaser or lessee under section 1018 against the seller or lessor would be monetary damages. It appears clear from the language of section 1018(c), that such an injured purchaser/lessee could not void or nullify the contract after ratification and could not void any transfer of real estate, through the use of section 1018 authority, even if it could be proven that the seller/lessor violated section 1018 provisions. Congress appears to have wanted to avoid upsetting real estate transactions once they were completed, and to have intended to limit the purchaser/lessee's remedies to civil damage suits. Also, Congress appears to have wanted not to create an independent cause of action for breach of contract or for any breach associated with real estate transfers through the use of section 1018. Of course, traditional causes of action under state law for misrepresentation/fraud would still exist, and possibly could be applied to some section 1018 violations. Also, violations of section 1018 would be subject to civil and criminal penalties administered by EPA and HUD under section 1018(b). VIII. Procedures for Requesting a Public Hearing The Act mandates Federal involvement in housing transactions at an unprecedented level. Recognizing the broad scope of these provisions, EPA and HUD will consider holding an informal hearing for public comment on this proposed rule in Washington, DC. To ensure adequate preparation for the hearing by all parties involved, persons or organizations desiring to participate in an informal hearing must file a written request for a hearing or to participate in any such hearing. The written request must be sent to the Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT . The written request to participate must include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. The request must be received by December 2, 1994. Should a hearing be held, organizations are requested to bring with them, to the extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each one of the areas to be addressed. Organizations which do not file written comments in response to the proposed rule will not be allowed to participate at the hearing. IX. Summary of Regulatory Impact Analysis EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) examining the potential costs, benefits, and impacts of regulations for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in residential property upon the transfer of the property for sale or rental. The analysis is presented in five sections: \u2022Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers \u2022Profile of Sectors Affected by the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers \u2022Estimated Costs to Private Parties from the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers \u2022Effect of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers on Small Businesses-Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis \u2022Assessment of the Benefits of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers. 1. Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers Those parties directly affected by the proposed rule are the seller, lessor, agent, property manager, buyer, and tenant. EPA found the required activities which give rise to regulatory burden imposed on the affected parties to fall into four categories for cost estimation purposes: \u2022Start-up costs, which include learning the rule's requirements and establishing compliance procedures. \u2022Disclosure activities, which refers to the costs resulting from the actual transfer of information and obtaining of needed signatures. \u2022Recordkeeping, which results from the requirement that signed acknowledgement forms must be retained by the provider of the information. \u2022Materials, which are linked primarily to the disclosure requirement, as the lead hazard information pamphlet must be purchased or photocopied (acknowedgement forms must also be duplicated). Costs may also be incurred for filing where a high number of acknowledgement forms are generated (e.g., agents), though such burden was estimated to be quite modest. The requirements of section 1018 of the Act fall primarily on the seller or lessor of ``target housing,'' which is defined to be any housing constructed prior to 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0 bedroom dwelling. However, if an agent or property manager acts on behalf of the seller or lessor, which EPA has estimated to be the case in the great majority of transfers, the responsibilities fall to such agents or managers. To estimate the cost impacts of the proposed rule, data were sought pertaining to the number of affected parties in each classification listed above, the frequency with which affected purchase and lease transactions are completed, and the incremental costs, in labor and materials, added to each transaction by the proposed regulations. 2. Profile of Sectors Affected by the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers The larger of the two affected sectors expected to bear the principal effects of the proposed rule falls within Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 651, Real Estate Operators and Lessors. EPA estimates there to be 96,000 establishments potentially affected by the proposed rule. Also affected are business establishments falling within SIC code 653, Real Estate Agents and Managers; an estimated 72,000 establishments could be affected by the proposed rule. Employment data for these industries were obtained for occupations most likely to be involved in transactions subject to the rule. EPA estimates that 339,000 real estate agents and 225,000 property managers will be affected. With regard to transaction volume, EPA found that 2.9 million sales transactions and 9.3 million rental transactions occur annually in target housing. 3. Estimated Costs to Private Parties from the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers Table 1 below presents a summary of the estimated annual compliance costs associated with the proposed rule. Each of the four cost categories appearing in the table are discussed briefly below. The first category, start-up costs, represents about one-third of overall annual costs. Factors affecting the magnitude of these costs include the number of employees having to familiarize themselves with the regulations, both initially (employees in the existing workforce) and over time (new entrants to the affected sectors); the time required to learn the activities which must be undertaken in order to comply; and the hourly compensation of affected employees. As is evident from Table 1 below, disclosure event costs constitute the greatest portion of overall costs. Factors affecting the magnitude of these costs include the frequencies of regulated events; the time involved in performing required activities, such as providing the prospective purchaser/tenant with the required information and obtaining the required signatures; and the hourly compensation of all involved parties. EPA also took into account the fact that a number of States have similar requirements pertaining to information transfer regarding potential lead hazards in the sale of residential property. Thus, an allowance was made in the burden estimates for transactions occurring in such States to reflect a certain level of current compliance. Table 1. _Summary of Annual Costs of Compliance 1&blank; 1&blank; lSales Transactions lStart-up Costs* l$24.5 million lDisclosure Event Costs l18.8 million lRecordkeeping Costs l0.6 million lMaterials Costs l1.1 million n,s lTotal for Sales Transactions: l$45.0 million lRental Transactions lStart-up Costs* l$ 0.9 million lDisclosure Event Costs l23.9 million lRecordkeeping Costs l1.8 million lMaterials Costs l2.6 million n,s lTotal for Sales Transactions: l$29.2 million lTotal Estimated Annual Costs: l$74.2 million *First-year costs annualized at 3 percent rate. Recordkeeping and materials costs comprise a relatively modest share of overall annual costs. Factors affecting the magnitude of these cost items include the number of affected parties per transaction; the frequency of transactions, the costs of acquiring/duplicating documents, which include the lead hazard information pamphlet and signed acknowledgement forms; and costs to maintain documents. 4. Effect of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers on Small Businesses - Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis EPA investigated the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small businesses, and has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). While a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule, cost impacts were not found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently, no regulatory alternatives are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. The IRFA is summarized separately below in Unit XI.C of this preamble. 5. Assessment of the Benefits of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers The market imperfection that the proposed rule is intended to correct is the lack of information available to prospective home buyers and renters on lead-based paint hazards in homes they may be considering for purchase or rent. Under the proposed rule, general information about risks associated with lead-based paint will be provided (through the provision of a brochure) and, when available, information about the presence of or abatement of lead in the specific unit being considered for purchase or rent must also be disclosed (e.g., information concerning previous testing for the presence of lead-based paint, abatement history, evidence of previous poisoning, etc.). The failure of the marketplace to provide this information or to provide prospective home buyers and renters the opportunity to develop such information means that prospective buyers and renters might purchase or lease a property, or make pricing or rental payment decisions regarding properties, without understanding possible lead-related health risks or risk management costs accompanying the transaction. EPA and HUD expect that this rulemaking will generate benefits by providing prospective home buyers and renters access to information which they otherwise may not have been able to acquire, such as information pertaining to abatement activities for a specific residence, or, in the case of more general information, which they may have been able to acquire only through their own effort at some cost. In addition, EPA believes the information will generate health benefits by leading many buyers and renters to modify their behavior in a way that will reduce risks from lead-based paint. For example, purchasers could undertake abatement activities subsequent to taking ownership of a dwelling, change household cleaning practices, or request professional assistance when undertaking renovation activities. The proposed rule may also prompt property owners, due to reluctance on the part of prospective buyers/renters to select housing containing lead-based paint, to act to reduce lead-related hazards associated with their residential dwellings. In cases where action is taken to remediate a lead-based paint hazard, additional costs would be incurred, and would have to be subtracted from the expected benefits associated with the remediation. EPA and HUD note that the regulation does not require actions to be taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards in residential housing; thus, the extent to which health benefits accrue depends upon how transaction participants, that is, sellers/lessors and prospective buyers/renters, value and respond to the additional information. In the RIA, three approaches are detailed that are evolving and can be seen as a starting point in an effort to expand the level of understanding of how benefits from information products can be valued. However, an information base and the associated accepted analytic methods necessary to predict consumer reaction to information products on lead-based paint hazards are not readily available; thus, quantifying the expected benefits of this proposed rule would be extremely difficult. Given the high level of uncertainty associated with the results from such a quantitative analysis, and given the prescriptive nature of section 1018 of the Act, EPA and HUD believe that the information provided in the qualitative analysis presented in the RIA served to inform decisionmaking. EPA invites comment, however, on its benefits analysis and on alternative approaches to assessing the benefits of the proposed rule. X. Confidential Business Information While EPA and HUD do not anticipate the receipt of much (if any) confidential business information (CBI) in connection with this rulemaking, a person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, including all or portions of written comments, submitted in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a comment subject to a claim of confidentiality must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted. Persons must label information claimed as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. A determination of whether information will be disclosed will be made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time they are submitted to EPA, EPA will place the information in the public record for this rulemaking without further notice to that person. XI. Rulemaking Record A record for this proposed rule has been established under docket number ``OPPTS&hyph;62130.'' The public version of this record (which does not contain any information claimed as CBI) is available for inspection from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays. The public record is located in EPA's TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC), Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. The following is a list of documents which EPA and HUD referred to in developing this regulation and which can be found in the docket. In addition, other documents, including those submitted with written comments from interested parties, will be included in the docket following the publication of this proposed rule in the Federal Register . The draft of the proposed rule submitted by EPA and HUD to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review prior to proposal will also be contained in the docket. The drafts of the final rule submitted for review before promulgation will be placed into the docket as well. 1. CPSC, Notice Reducing Allowable Levels of Lead in Lead-Based Paint.

Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grant, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it is raising novel policy issues arising out of its legal mandate. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented in the public record. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In an effort to identify and characterize the proposed rule's effects on small business, EPA and HUD have prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). This assessment has been included as part of the RIA, and is summarized below. In preparing the IRFA, EPA and HUD first developed an establishment profile for each major sector (SIC 651 and SIC 653). This profile indicated that approximately 75 percent of all establishments in SIC 651 (Real Estate Operators and Lessors) and approximately 71 percent of all establishments in SIC 653 (Real Estate Agents and Managers) fell within the 1 to 4 employee size class. These proportions increased to 90 percent and 86 percent, respectively, when employee size class 1 to 9 was examined. To measure the cost impacts of the proposed rule on these small establishments, representative, or model establishments were designed. These model establishments corresponded to typical establishments, with respect to number of employees and annual transaction volume, in each affected sector. Since transaction activity was reported to vary widely, a range of transaction volume was estimated for each establishment type. For each model establishment, annual regulatory costs were then calculated and compared to annual labor and overhead costs. Ratios were computed for both high and low estimates of the range of transaction activity. In the case of a real estate sales organization, regulatory costs were found to represent from 0.18 to 0.38 percent of labor and overhead costs. In the case of a rental establishment, impacts were slightly higher, ranging from 0.20 to 0.46 percent. An establishment engaged in both activities was projected to sustain impacts of 0.26 to 0.59 percent. Thus, while a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule, cost impacts were not found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently, no regulatory alternatives are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have been submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq . An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA and HUD (ICR No. 1710.01) and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. The collection of information that would be associated with this proposed rule is estimated to have a public burden averaging 19.5 minutes per response (at 6.5 minutes per an average of 3 respondents), and to require 15.4 minutes per respondent, annually. This includes time for gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136); Environmental Protection Agency; 401 M St., SW; Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule. D. Environmental Impact In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.19 and 50.20(o)(2) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this proposed rule relate only to information services and, therfore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. E. HUD's Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was listed as Item No. 1517 in HUD's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20431), in accordance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and was requested by and submitted to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives under section 7(o) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act.

For purposes of enforcing this subpart under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the penalty for each violation applicable under section 16 of that Act is not more than $10,000.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941102-1-00119", "score": 6.758999824523926}, {"content": "Title: Content: 1. Applicability The applicability of the subpart CC standards has been revised since proposal to specifically exempt from the rule certain tanks surface impoundments, and containers in which the owner or operator has stopped adding hazardous waste. The subpart CC standards do not apply to a tank, surface impoundment, or container that meets either of the following conditions: (1) No hazardous waste is added to the waste management unit on or after June 5, 1995 (see generally 55 FR 39409, September 27, 1990); or (2) Addition to hazardous waste to the waste management unit is stopped and the owner or operator has begun implementing or completed closure pursuant to an approved closure plan. In addition, the applicability of the subpart CC standards has been changed such that the rule is not applicable to any container having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 (approximately 26 gallons) regardless of the organic content of the hazardous waste handled in the container. In response to comments on the proposed rule, the EPA reviewed the types of small containers commonly used to accumulate and transfer hazardous waste. Considering the small quantity of hazardous waste handled in a sample collection vial, safety can, disposal can, and other types of small containers and the short periods of time that the waste normally remains in one of these containers, the EPA concluded that existing rules for containers having a design capacity less than 0.1 m3 are sufficient to protect human health and the environment. Finally, the EPA has decided to temporarily defer application of the subpart CC standards to tanks, surface impoundments, and containers managing hazardous wastes under certain special circumstances. For now, the EPA is deferring application of the subpart CC standards to waste management units that are used solely to treat or store hazardous wastes generated on-site from remedial activities required under RCRA corrective action or CERCLA response authorities (or similar State remediation authorities). Also, the EPA is deferring application of the subpart CC standards to waste management units that are used solely to manage radioactive mixed wastes. The EPA's rationale for these deferrals is explained in section VIII.A.1 of this preamble. 2. General Standards For each tank, surface impoundment, or container to which the subpart CC standards apply (referred to here as an ``affected unit''), the owner or operator is required to use the air emission controls specified in the rule except when the hazardous waste placed in an affected unit meets certain conditions. As explained in the following paragraphs, the conditions under which an affected unit is exempted from the air emission control requirements of the subpart CC standards have been revised since proposal. a. Waste volatile organic concentration exemption. Under the final subpart CC standards, an affected unit is exempt from the air emission control requirements of the rule if all hazardous waste placed in the unit is determined to have an average volatile organic concentration less than 100 parts per million by weight (ppmw) based on the organic composition of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination. This waste volatile organic concentration limit incorporates several revisions that have been made by the EPA since proposal. First, the format for the limit has been changed to be the average volatile organic concentration of the hazardous waste on a mass-weighted basis during normal operating conditions for the source or process generating the waste (in contrast to the proposed format of the maximum volatile organic concentration for the hazardous waste never to be exceeded). Averaging periods up to 1 year in duration are allowed for each individual waste stream under the final rule. The procedures for determining the average volatile organic concentration of a waste are explained further under ``Waste Determination Procedures'' in this section and in section VII.A.3 of this preamble.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941206-0-00137", "score": 6.756199836730957}, {"content": "Title: Content: B.

The current 1915 standard is not adequate when addressing training requirements. While the 1915 standards state that the SCP [shipyard competent person] must have certain abilities it does not require formal training. There are also no formal training requirements for personnel working in confined spaces. These deficiencies should be addressed. The SCP should receive formal training on testing, ventilation, fire and explosive and toxic hazards as is being currently covered by NFPA SCP courses. General workers do not require the same level of training but should be instructed as to the hazards associated with confined spaces and the employer's testing, entry, hot work and space labeling or identification program. [Ex. 11&hyph;10] OSHA's requirements for shipyard competent persons are contained in final \u00a71915.7, which is discussed earlier in this preamble. The employer is responsible for ensuring that these designated individuals have knowledge and skills appropriate for determining whether or not a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere is safe to enter. The employer cannot have the necessary information to designate a person as a competent person unless that employer either provides the necessary training or ensures that the person has already received it. In addition, if the competent person is not an employee, the employer will not usually be the source of that person's training. Therefore, rather than specifying shipyard competent person training this final rule focuses on the abilities and skills of the competent person and holds the employer responsible for determining that the competent person meets those requirements. Other commenters suggested that OSHA require all exposed shipyard employees to receive training as outlined in the SESAC recommendation (Ex. 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;30, 11&hyph;50). They argued that all workers that work in areas containing confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres should be aware of the hazards of unrestricted entry into those spaces. For example, the U.S. Department of the Navy (Ex. 11&hyph;30) stated: All workers except those who will never be involved with confined space entry/work should be trained. Minimum knowledge should be a well understood concept of what a confined or enclosed space is, what the potential hazards are, and the need for space evaluation by a knowledgeable individual and, in some cases, certification by a ``qualified person'' prior to entry and work. One commenter, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) (Ex. 11&hyph;51), suggested that the standard specify that employees receive classroom-type training. They were concerned that employees would receive a simple briefing rather than actual training. They stated their concerns as follows: The ability to have specific directions to train and provide annual review with classroom type instruction, and where the instructor has direct inter-play with the employee, is the most desirable, as well as preferred. One of the big problems that we have always felt has been the issue in training is the addressing of specific training. In the training of employees at our facility, stand-up safety briefings are used for training in Haz Com. The employee is asked to sign the back of this briefing to show they have attended and received the training. In the briefings given, the person giving the briefing has had little or no formal training on the subject material, making it a perfect ``paper program''. The only way we know it does not work is through interviews with the employees. It is therefore imperative that the recommendations of SESAC be followed, as they are most inclusive and specific, and that the instructors be knowledgeable of the subject material. OSHA has not adopted the IBEW's suggestion. Employers may use classroom or ``on-the-job'' instruction or a combination of the two in complying with final \u00a71915.12(d). The primary objective of final \u00a71915.12(d) is to ensure that employees will be familiar with the subjects listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3). There may be wide variations in the combinations of classroom and on-the-job training that may be necessary for different work sites, configurations, and control measures. On the other hand, OSHA shares IBEW's concern that some employers might try to comply with the standard through simple briefings that impart little knowledge to employees. In enforcing final revised Subpart B, the Agency will determine whether employees have learned the subject matter addressed by the standard by interviewing employees and reviewing the employer's procedures for dealing with communicating hazard information and ensuring employees have the skills necessary to do their jobs. In addition the Agency will examine the employer's certification that the training has been provided as required by final \u00a71915.12(d)(5). It should be noted that, whatever the method of training that is provided, it must be provided before an employee enters a confined or enclosed space or other dangerous atmosphere, as required by final \u00a71915.12(d)(4). The requirements adopted in final \u00a71915.12(d) are based on the recommendations of SESAC as presented in the notice reopening the record on Subpart B. The purpose of these requirements, along with an explanation of any differences between the final rule and SESAC's proposed language, is presented in the following discussion. In paragraph (d)(1), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that employees who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres are trained to perform their duties safely. This provision is intended to ensure that employees are familiar with the duties imposed by final revised Subpart B so that the work practices they use will conform to the standard and will protect them from hazards posed by these spaces. In paragraph (d)(2), OSHA is requiring employers to ensure that each employee who must enter confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres is trained to recognize and understand the hazards or hazardous conditions he or she may encounter during entry. The specific hazards or hazardous conditions that OSHA addresses are found in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (d)(2)(vii) and they include the following: (1) Recognition of the characteristics of the space, (2) Anticipation and awareness of the hazards that may be encountered during entry, (3) Recognition of the signs, symptoms, or other adverse health effects that may be caused by exposure to hazards,", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940725-0-00152", "score": 6.751200199127197}, {"content": "Title: Content: Neurobehavioral Health Risks in Farmworkers: Meeting The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the following meeting.

PURPOSE: Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles. Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, as well as a worker study at the same site, the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of Idaho citizens to provide consensus advice regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The draft charter for this proposed committee states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each DOE site, operational guidelines at each site must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and the responsibilities of the Committee members and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public meetings to begin developing operational guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of these public meetings is to update the public on the status of CDC's and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and recommendations from interested parties concerning operational guidelines.

Process waters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigments containing high levels of aniline or other raw materials and solvents sometimes are sent to a distillation column for recovery of the material for reuse in the process. As expected, the bottoms generated from the distillation contain high concentrations of the material being recovered. The concentrations of aniline present in two samples collected exemplify the concentrations of solvent contaminants anticipated in these wastes. Information on the concentration of aniline observed is not presented at his time due to business confidentiality concerns. Based on data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, four facilities generated a total of 1700 metric tons of this waste in 1991. EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this waste in Table II&hyph;11. The data presented in this table represent two samples from two facilities. These samples were collected from the two largest generators of this wastestream, both of which recover aniline from the wastewater. One of the remaining two facilities recovers other aniline derivatives ( i.e., N,N- dimethylaniline and N,N-diethylaniline) that are used as raw materials and solvents in the production of triarylmethane dyes. The second facility recovers chlorobenzene used as a solvent in the production of triarylmethane dyes and generates a still bottom waste that is reported to contain 50% chlorobenzene. This waste is already listed as F002, based on the use of the solvent chlorobenzene. Based on an evaluation of the processes generating these wastes and the contaminants reported to be present by industry, the Agency believes the risks posed are similar to those assessed in Table II&hyph;11. The data used to characterize these wastestreams, assess the risks posed by these wastes, and make a proposed listing determination on the waste grouping were obtained from the two samples collected by EPA and the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Waste management information relevant to this discussion are not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. As discussed earlier in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on these wastestreams using the two most widely used practices, the on-site boiler and municipal landfill as the current management scenario, and an on-site boiler (for the air pathway) and on-site monofill (for the ground-water pathway) as the plausible management scenario. The risk posed by the presence of aniline in the concentrations found in the waste is estimated to be very high ( i.e., greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water pathway, and HQ=6 for the air pathway). Due to the imperfect nature of any recovery process, it is not unexpected that large quantities of aniline, or any other raw material or solvent being recovered, would be present in these still bottoms. Aniline was found in very high concentrations ( i.e., the low concentration was 1.9%) in both distillation bottom samples collected from triarylmethane pigment production. Information on the high concentration value is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. In addition to aniline, the two sets of coeluting constituents present in the wastewater treatment sludge and wastewaters from these operations ( i.e., 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine) also are present in the distillation bottoms (K166). These compounds are all likely by-products arising from the oxidation of aniline. The MS curve representing 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene was identified in both distillation bottom samples collected from triarylmethane pigment operations. For the reasons discussed in Section II.D, the Agency conducted the risk assessment for these coeluting compounds independently. The resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this first set of coeluting compounds is greater than 9E&hyph;3. Likewise, the risk assessment for N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine was conducted independently, as discussed in Section II.D. The resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this second set of coeluting compounds is 6E&hyph;6. In addition to assessing the risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of still bottoms from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments, all of the constituents are believed to co-exist in the wastestream. The distillation columns generating this residual process the same wastestream with each dye or pigment batch. As a result, the constituents detected are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. The risk of each individual constituent is high, and the combined risks of these constituents are very high (greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water pathway and 6E&hyph;5 for the air pathway), both of which were considered in making this listing determination. In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible management practice (on-site boiler for the air pathway and on-site monofill for the ground-water pathway), the risks posed by the baseline management practice (on-site boiler for the air pathway and municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway) are also very high. Specifically, the risks posed by the current management practices are greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water pathway, and 6E&hyph;5 (carcinogens) and HQ=6 (non-carcinogens) for the air pathway. In summary, the calculated risks associated with managing these still bottoms in on-site boilers, municipal landfills, and on-site monofills are all very high, based on each of the individual hazardous constituents in the wastestream and the combined risks due to carcinogens found in the wastestream as a whole. Therefore, based on the risks associated with both current management and plausible management practices for this waste, EPA is proposing to list as hazardous still bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K166. For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for Listing: 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, azobenzene, aniline, diphenylamine, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine. In addition, azobenzene and N-nitrosodiphenylamine are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents. 5.Wastes from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments. a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments. Summary EPA is proposing to defer the proposed listing determination for wastewater treatment sludges from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time. Based on analysis of the sludge samples collected by the Agency, no constituents attributable to anthraquinone processes were detected. However, data supplied by industry indicate the presence of two constituents on the target analyte list for which no health-based levels and no adequate surrogates exist. Based on this discrepancy and the need to identify surrogates for risk analysis, the Agency believes a deferral is appropriate for this wastestream. Discussion This sludge is generated from the treatment of wastewaters from anthraquinone dye and pigment manufacturing.

This is most often done by a person traveling alone who is often required to be in the bleeder entries or worked-out areas for an extended period. The purpose of this standard is to protect miners, not to regulate air quality where persons are not exposed. Therefore, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels at bleeder connectors and bleeder evaluation points that do not meet the proposed concentrations would not constitute a violation of the standard if examinations are performed remotely or if persons making the examination can otherwise remain in air that meets the proposal. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic, May 1987), 19.5 percent oxygen provides an adequate amount of oxygen for most work assignments and incorporates a safety factor. Also according to NIOSH, the safety factor is needed because oxygen-deficient atmospheres offer little warning of danger. In the NIOSH publication, ``A Guide to Safety in Confined Spaces,'' (page 4), a chart is presented that indicates that 19.5 percent oxygen is the minimum level for safe entry into an area, and that at a level of 16 percent, judgement and breathing are impaired. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), in ANSI Z88.2&hyph;1992, ``American National Standard for Respiratory Protection'' recognizes that at 16 percent oxygen there is an impairment in the ability to think and pay attention, and a reduction in coordination. ANSI recognizes that at 19 percent oxygen there are some adverse physiological effects, but they are unnoticeable. The need for regulating the oxygen level where persons work or travel in bleeder entries is illustrated by two mining accidents. One of these accidents resulted in the death of a mine examiner and the second resulted in the near death of two additional individuals, one of whom was a mine examiner. Mine examiners are, through training and experience, the individuals best able to identify the hazards associated with irrespirable atmospheres. The first accident occurred at the Arclar Mine in Equality, Illinois in 1989. Prior to implementation of the existing standard, a mine examiner, for unknown reasons, entered a worked-out area that was posted with a danger sign. Under the existing regulation, ventilation or sealing of this area, rather than posting, would be required. Because the area was not sealed, the existing regulation would require the area to be examined during the weekly examination. The proposal would require that the route of travel for the examiner would contain at least 19.5 percent oxygen. Had the proposal been in place when the examiner entered the worked-out area, there is a strong likelihood that he would not have died. The second accident, although not in a bleeder entry or worked-out area, is illustrative of what can happen when individuals, including mine examiners, are subjected to oxygen deficient air. In 1983 at the Bird No. 3 Mine in Riverside, Pennsylvania, an assistant mine foreman, a certified person, entered the mine for the purpose of conducting an examination. After traveling approximately 1100 feet, the examiner became dizzy, noticed that his flame safety lamp had extinguished and withdrew approximately 200 feet where he sat down and apparently became unconscious. A second individual upon entering the area in search of the examiner also became dizzy but was able to withdraw to a location that was not oxygen deficient. When the mine examiner regained consciousness, his cap lamp battery had discharged and he traveled in total darkness until he encountered a mine rescue team. Air samples collected in the area where the mine examiner first became dizzy indicated an oxygen concentration of about 16.8 percent, while other samples collected nearby indicated oxygen concentrations of nearly 20 percent. Because mine examiners are required to work or travel in areas where oxygen-deficient air could occur without warning, and they normally travel and work alone, there must be a requirement that provides them the protection necessary for the performance of their duties under these conditions. It is important that the level for oxygen be established above that identified as resulting in impaired judgement because it is essential that individuals traveling in these areas remain highly alert. The hazards that can exist in bleeder entries and worked-out areas include elevated methane levels, poor footing, loose and unstable roof, and water accumulations. For this reason, the Agency is proposing to adopt a minimum level of oxygen of 19.5 percent as recommended by NIOSH. MSHA is also concerned with the effects of other gases often found in bleeder entries. Section 75.322 of the existing regulation limits the concentration of noxious or poisonous gases to the current (1971) Threshold Limit Values (TLV's) as adopted and applied by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Section 75.322 specifically excludes carbon dioxide since it is covered by \u00a775.321. However, in light of the Court's stay of \u00a775.321(a) relative to bleeder entries, the Agency is proposing a separate standard for carbon dioxide levels for areas where persons work or travel in bleeder entries and worked-out areas. The levels proposed, 0.5 percent TWA and 3.0 percent STEL, when considered in conjunction with the requirements of \u00a775.322 and the proposed requirement for oxygen, will aid in providing persons working or traveling in these areas with a safe and healthful working environment. The Agency recognizes that the effects of carbon dioxide are both chronic and acute and has therefore elected to propose both a time weighted average and a short term exposure limit. NIOSH, in recommending a standard for carbon dioxide, also recognized this and recommended a similar approach. The NIOSH recommendation, made in a Criteria Document published in 1976, proposed a TWA concentration of 1.0 percent and a ceiling value of 3.0 percent not to exceed 10 minutes. In making this recommendation, NIOSH states that there are ``additive stress effects of increased carbon dioxide concentrations and exercise *&blank;*&blank;*'' As support for this, the NIOSH document cites research that showed that healthy, trained subjects exposed to 2.8 to 5.2 percent carbon dioxide at maximum exercise levels experienced respiratory difficulty, impaired vision, severe headache, and mental confusion; three subjects collapsed. At or below 2.8 percent carbon dioxide combined with lower, but still strenuous, levels of exercise, no ill effects other than awareness of increased ventilation were experienced by the subjects.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940719-1-00056", "score": 6.691299915313721}, {"content": "Title: Content: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Public Meeting The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the following meeting.

Status: Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. Purpose: Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living offsite of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associates (SC&A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&A will discuss project progress and responses to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions faced by SC&A's project team. Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.

The new \"Infection Research\" funding scheme, which is being launched under the \"Health Research 2000\" program, will take account of this experience. It will bring together and continue existing BMFT funding measures on AIDS, tropical medicine, and other infectious diseases. In future, priority will be given to funding projects with particular potential for enhancing clinical research structures in this area. It is initially intended to fund the scheme with approximately 35 million marks [DM] a year. The following individual topics will be covered: -- The AIDS pandemic has made everyone aware of the health hazard to the population posed when new pathogens appear. With an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 patients infected in y alone since the outbreak of the pandemic, AIDS-related topics will continue to require an enormous amount of work. However, topics such as infection via tick bites (Lyme's borreliosis) and the much-debated possibility of the transfer to humans of what is popularly known as \"mad cow disease\" are also worth mentioning in this connection. These examples illustrate the need to create sufficient research capability to meet new challenges effectively. -- The rapid increase in salmonella cases in recent times has shown how known pathogens spread: The number of new infections has doubled in only 10 years to over 90,000 cases a year. The constant rise in the number of infections contracted in hospital, which constitutes a growing problem for our health system, is also a major issue here. -- The phenomenon of resistance to antibiotics has been known for a long time but has recently become a greater hazard with the advent of multiresistances in tuberculosis pathogens and the progressive development of resistance in the malaria tropica pathogen. The transition of findings from research into practice is still being hindered by a lack of cooperation between basic research and clinicians. One of the reasons why this is so in y is that infectious diseases have low priority as a clinical specialization, which, indeed, is absent from most university clinics. Three funding channels designed specifically to remedy these shortcomings will therefore be used to continue existing BMFT funding of research into infectious diseases: -- The funding of joint research is intended to foster local, regional, and national interdisciplinary cooperation. The funding authority specifies no particular topics, so all areas of applied research into infection are eligible. -- In order to place the study of infectious diseases on a firmer institutional footing, structural aid for university research facilities and funds for redirecting existing facilities will be granted. This offer of financial priming over a limited period is designed primarily to stimulate and support research work in faculties of medicine, which has largely had to give way to routine health care work over recent decades. -- A grants scheme will be available to attract trainee scientists to this field. This scheme follows on from the established AIDS grant scheme, which will cease to be exclusive to work on AIDS in the future. As a rule, funding will be provided for a two-year term spent at a research facility of international renown followed by a post at a institute for a maximum of three years. The BMFT is currently funding infectious disease research under four main headings: -- AIDS: Shortly after the first cases of the disease were reported in y, the BMFT issued an initial annoucement on research funding at the end of 1983. 1984 saw the beginning of the first projects financed by the BMFT. Since then, 138 medical and natural science research projects, 34 social science research projects, and nine clinical research consortia (in Berlin, Frankfurt (2), Hamburg, Hannover, Heidelberg, Munich (2), and Wuerzburg) have been funded and 58 grants awarded. Overall, approximately DM165 million have been spent to date on AIDS research. In the initial stages it was necessary to fund AIDS research under a single program to react rapidly to a new health policy challenge. AIDS research has attained a high standard, although a solution to the AIDS problem cannot be expected in the short term. The topic will therefore remain a major area for funding. -- Tropical medicine: The BMFT intended this program to provide targeted funding for research on tropical medicine in areas where the funding could be expected to promote long-term structural improvements. The first measure introduced was the comprehensive restructuring and reorientation of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, on which DM8.7 million have been spent since 1992. -- Diagnostics of infectious diseases: The primary goal here was to improve and extend the available range of methods for detecting pathogens or pathogen components and antibodies in viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasite infections. Grants totaling about DM17 million were awarded to 46 projects between 1981 and 1991. -- Infectious diseases: This heading covered the whole range of research from fundamental principles to diagnostic and therapeutic advances and vaccine development. Between 1987 and 1992, a total of 54 individual projects, 10 consortia, and one case of structural aid (for Wuerzburg University's Infectious Disease Research Center) were funded for an approximate total of DM67 million.

Target audiences are community members and health professionals. Preventive health education related to sites should be integral to the entire public health activities process and not simply performed when all other activities are completed. Sites for health education should be selected based on public health need. The following describes the two types of site-specific preventive health education activities. Community Health Education_ Any activity or activities directed toward the community near a site, designed to assist the community in understanding their potential for exposure or assessing adverse health occurrence in their community and to prevent or mitigate exposure to hazardous substances. Activities may include disseminating written materials, presenting coordinated programs involving on-site actions and site-specific materials development (prevention oriented), or supporting an on site health educator. It is assumed that in community health education, community members are involved in the assessment, policy development, and assurance phases of site-specific preventive health education. Health Professional Education_ Any activity or activities directed toward educating public health professionals and the local medical community. The purpose of these activities is to improve the knowledge, skill, and behavior of health professionals concerning medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing injury or disease related to exposure to hazardous substances. See Recipient Activities for a description of types of activities. General Environmental Health Education_Programs and materials for health professionals that may not be directly related to a site, but contribute to the base of knowledge in environmental health and help equip health professionals to more effectively address environmental health issues. A partial list of appropriate and inappropriate topics to be addressed by these efforts follows: Sample of Appropriate Topics: Superfund site hazardous substances on the priority pollutant list (the ranked list of substances prioritized by ATSDR and the EPA appears in Federal Register issue 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991); environmental exposure histories; resources for environmental health information; environmental toxicology; environmental epidemiology; and health risk communication. Sample of Inappropriate Topics: Occupational health/workplace exposures; radon; indoor air; sick building syndrome; secondhand smoke; ozone; air pollution; carbon monoxide poisoning; childhood lead poisoning (unless site-related); greenhouse effect; insect repellents; and household chemicals. Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP)_This is a multidisciplinary intra-Agency panel established to evaluate the data and information contained in public health assessments, health consultations, public health advisories and other documents developed by ATSDR to determine public health follow-up actions_including environmental health education_needed for communities affected by exposures to hazardous substances present at hazardous waste sites nationwide. States funded under the health education cooperative agreement may be asked to participate in HARP review of selected sites, when appropriate. Program Requirements In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities under A., below, and ATSDR shall be responsible for conducting activities under B., below: A. Recipient Activities 1. Site-Specific Preventive Health Education Site-specific preventive health education includes activities for health professionals, communities, and that apply to both audiences. a. Health professionals. (1) Develop for health professionals site-related educational activities. Sites to be addressed include: sites listed or proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL); HARP-recommended sites; sites that have had consultations or petitions, and other sites where the State and ATSDR determine health education is needed. Activities relevant to hazardous substances found at these sites are also appropriate. Activities include grand rounds, short courses, and workshops. (2) Develop educational materials to improve the skills and knowledge of health professionals concerning potential exposure to hazardous substances at Superfund (or HARP) sites. If non-printed materials are to be developed, the applicant must thoroughly describe the materials, and justify their superiority over traditional educational materials. b. Communities. Develop and conduct community health education activities and materials related to potential exposure to hazardous substances at sites as described above in 1.a. The recipient should give priority to HARP-recommended sites and those sites where community members can take specific actions to reduce or eliminate exposure to hazardous substances.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940711-2-00084", "score": 6.671500205993652}, {"content": "Title: Content: April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition FOOD BRIEFS: CDC ISSUES TOXIN ALERT ON TROPICAL SEAFOOD SPECIES Thorough heating is inadequate protection against toxins that may be present in certain tropical seafood species, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. An article in the agency's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report found that cooking did not destroy elevated levels of scombroid toxin -- a naturally occurring contaminant -- in fish identified as the source of two outbreaks last year. In each of the incidents, which occurred in Chicago and Charleston, S.C., victims were diagnosed as suffering from scombroid poisoning. This particular toxin is fast-acting and is capable of producing symptoms in otherwise healthy adults in as little as five minutes after a meal. The attack, which can last up to 10 hours and may require emergency medical care, includes nausea, dizziness, facial swelling, diarrhea and fever. There have been 192 scombroid fish poisoning outbreaks in this country between 1973 and 1987 resulting in more than 1,000 illnesses, according to the CDC. Hawaii, with 51, and California, with 29, topped all other states in the number of such incidents. None of the cases involved fatalities. Those species most often implicated in these poisonings are mahi-mahi, tuna and bluefish. The scombroid toxin is produced in dark-fleshed fresh fish with high levels of the compound histidine, an amino acid. Under poor storage conditions -- whether on fishing boats, docks or in warehouses -- the histidine can be converted into histimine by surface bacteria on the fish. \"This is a situation where the bacteria that are normally present on the fish break down the other normal surface materials to form abnormally high levels of toxic products,\" said Stephen Ostroff M.D., CDC medical epidemiologist familiar with the report. As little as 20 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams of fresh fish can cause symptoms, according to the CDC. Hazardous levels of the compound in tuna are considered to be 50 milligrams of histimine per 100 grams. In the Chicago outbreak, which produced eight illnesses, mahi-mahi was implicated as the source of the contamination. Investigators found that the fish showed signs of freezer burn or had been thawed and improperly refrozen. Laboratory tests found levels of histimine in the remaining fish to be three times that considered hazardous by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As for the Charleston case, contaminated yellow-fin tuna was identified as the cause of nine illnesses. However, local health officials who reviewed the incident found that the suspect fish was kept thoroughly iced throughout storage and handling. Even so, investigators found that histimine present in uneaten tuna was 10 to 15 times above the level considered hazardous. \"As these outbreaks demonstrate, cooking toxic fish is not protective,\" the article stated. The authors recommend continuous icing or refrigeration for all potentially scombroid-toxic fish from the point at which the catch leaves the water until cooking. This recommendation, however, is standard advice for all fish species -- not just the dark-flesh varieties. \"There is nothing else the consumer can do if they get a bad piece of fish. You can't smell the toxin, feel it or see it,\" said Ostroff. \"But people have to realize that, while this is a problem, it is not a frequent occurrence.\" Tropical Toxins -- Often mentioned in tandem with scombroid poisoning is ciguatera, another toxin found in tropical reef fish. The number of poisoning incidents involving ciguatera are estimated to be 25% higher than that from scombroid, Ostroff said. From 1973 to 1987 there were a total of 233 ciguatera outbreaks with a total of 1,045 illnesses and three fatalities. Most of these incidents, or 167, occurred in Hawaii. Another 35 were in Florida and only three in California. Species linked to ciguatera, which is formed when fish eat a certain poisonous reef algae, include mahi-mahi, barracuda, amber jack and some red snapper varieties. The CDC's statistics for seafood-related poisonings, including bacteria such as Vibrio cholera and Vibrio vulnificus, are considered fairly well documented because the contaminations are so distinctive. \"Seafood-related illnesses tend to be more severe (than those caused by other foods),\" said Ostroff. \"Cholera, ciguatoxin, scombroid are often easily recognizable entities. Another one is paralytic shellfish poisoning. They usually involve a small number of people when noticed (by health officials). Cholera cases sometimes only involve one person.\" In terms of outbreaks, it appears that there are more poisonings and illnesses related to seafood than any other individual protein source. That's because illnesses caused by meats, such as salmonellosis and camplylobacteriosis, are harder to detect and are often not as identifiable. Symptoms in these cases can also be more variable. \"A substantial portion of the outbreaks (documented by CDC) where there's a known contaminant and a specific food are seafood related,\" said Ostroff. There were 7,431 food-related outbreaks between 1973 and 1987. Seafood accounted for 11.1% of these, or 827 outbreaks and 12,766 illnesses, according to the CDC. Half of all the episodes, however, have undetermined causes. As a result, the figure for seafood contaminations, as well as for those cases linked to any other individual food, can be doubled as a way of accounting for the percentage of unknown causes, Ostroff said. \"The proportion of seafood-related illnesses are higher than any particular meat product,\" he said. However, Ostroff disagreed with some consumer groups who have claimed that the contamination threat from seafood -- in general -- is a greater health risk to consumers than is meat or poultry. Botulism Threat -- Improper storage conditions also played an important role in another food poisoning recently reported by the FDA. The agency linked three botulism cases in the New York City area with consumption of a commercial garlic-and-oil mix that was kept at room temperature despite a label stating \"Keep Refrigerated.\" A preliminary investigation by health officials implicated a product no longer manufactured: Chopped Garlic in Extra Virgin Olive Oil made by Colavita Pasta & Oil Co. The Newark, N.J.,-based firm discontinued the item a year ago but announced a recall of the product nevertheless. The victims, each of whom required hospitalization, apparently used the oil to prepare garlic bread. As a result of this and other recent cases, the FDA has alerted commercial producers of similar products to ensure that labels and bulk packaging materials prominently state, \"Requires Refrigeration for Safety\" or \"Refrigerate Both Before and After Opening.\" FDA researchers have found that oils present an ideal environment for the growth of botulinum spores. \"Clostridium botulinum bacteria are widespread . . . and may be found on various produce, including garlic, but their spores are harmless when there is oxygen in the environment,\" according to the FDA's account of the episode. \"However, the spores can produce a deadly toxin when in an oxygen-free, low-acid environment.\" A similar contamination incident occurred in 1985, the FDA reported, when 37 people suffered from botulism after eating a dish that included a commercial chopped garlic in soybean oil in a Vancouver, British Columbia, restaurant. As a result of the recent problems with garlic in oil, the agency is warning that any such commercial or homemade mixes can pose serious health risks if left at room temperature.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA040689-0078", "score": 6.66949987411499}, {"content": "Title: Content: ADDRESSES: The information upon which this determination is based is available to the public and may be inspected during normal business hours at the EPA Library, 10th floor, Park Place Building, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action is being taken under the authority of section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 United States Code, 300f, 300h-3(e), Pub. L. 93&hyph;523). The information upon which EPA is issuing this final determination has been summarized in the ``Support Document for Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System'', EPA 910/R&hyph;94&hyph;002. I. Background Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act states: If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that determination in the Federal Register . After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for federal assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer. EPA further defines a ``Sole Source Aquifer'' (SSA) as one which supplies at least 50 percent of the drinking water to persons living in the area overlying the aquifer and in areas supplied by the aquifer, and if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health. Designations can be made for entire aquifers, hydrogeologically connected aquifers (aquifer systems), or part of an aquifer if that portion is hydrogeologically separated from the rest of the aquifer. EPA guidelines further stipulate that these areas can have no feasible alternative source(s) of drinking water of sufficient volume which could replace the aquifer, should it become contaminated. Although EPA has the authority to initiate SSA designations, the Agency has a policy of acting only in response to petitions. Petitions may be submitted to EPA by any individual or organization and must address procedures and criteria outlined in the ``Sole Source Aquifer Designation Petitioner Guidance'', EPA 440/6&hyph;87&hyph;003. EPA Region 10 received a petition from the Marrowstone Island Community Association on August 27, 1991, and after an initial review, the petition was declared complete on September 19, 1991. A more detailed technical review was completed in February of 1994. EPA's findings and basis for the proposed designation were documented and made available for public review in EPA publication 910/R&hyph;94&hyph;002. II. Basis for Determination The Region 10 Administrator has determined that the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System meets all applicable SSA designation criteria established through Federal statute and EPA guidance documents, as follows: 1. The Marrowstone Island Aquifer System supplies approximately 98 percent of the drinking water to persons living on the island; 2. As the principal drinking water source for the area, contamination of the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System would create a significant hazard to public health; 3. The boundary was determined in accordance with EPA guidance and is representative of an aquifer system that encompasses the entire Marrowstone Island area and includes all potable water-bearing geologic units underlying the Island; 4. There are no feasible alternative source(s) of drinking water which could replace the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System, should it become contaminated. III. Description of the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System Note: Some information in this section represents an unfootnoted summary from the ``Support Document for Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Marrowstone Island Aquifer System'', EPA 910/R&hyph;94&hyph;002. Marrowstone Island is an elongate island located in the northern Puget Sound area of Jefferson County, Washington, near the City of Port Townsend. The island is approximately eight miles long and one mile wide and reaches a maximum elevation of approximately 180 feet above mean sea level. Marrowstone Island Aquifer System boundaries are representative of an aquifer system that encompasses the entire Marrowstone Island area. The aquifer system is bounded by the shorelines of Admiralty Inlet, Kilisut Harbor, and Oak Bay. A straight line boundary divides Indian Island from Marrowstone Island in the southwest corner of the Island. The vertical extent of the aquifer system at depth includes all potable water-bearing geologic units underlying the Island. Water level data indicates that all deposits underlying the Island are hydrogeologically connected. Water quality studies have discovered elevated chloride concentrations that indicate seawater intrusion is occurring in the fresh water aquifer system underlying the Island. This intrusion of seawater is the result of increased pumping of the aquifers, which in turn, is attributable to the increase in Island population. Other potential sources of contamination include many normal rural activities, such as improper pesticide storage and use, improper disposal of used motor oil and other household hazardous wastes, and poorly-sited or maintained storm water drainage wells, animal waste storage facilities, on-site septic systems, and underground storage tanks. Population of the Island varies by season, with the highest population occurring in the summer, and lowest in the winter. There are approximately 900 permanent residents of the Island. During a peak summer weekend, the population increases by about one-third for a total maximum population of 1300 people. There may be as few as 600 resident water users on a typical winter weekday. Approximately 98 percent of the water consumed on the Island is ground water pumped from the aquifer system by about 400 private wells. Roughly one percent of water used on the Island is collected in rainwater collection systems and used primarily for livestock consumption and outside watering of lawns and gardens. Another one percent is obtained from Fort Flagler State Park which receives water via pipeline from a U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Detachment facility on Indian Island. There are no physical, legal, or economically feasible alternative source(s) of drinking water that could replace the aquifer system.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940602-2-00187", "score": 6.646999835968018}, {"content": "Title: Content: Course 510, Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry 1.

Existing facility design features would reduce direct worker contact with radioactive materials. The formation of dioxins from Glass Melter operation would be virtually precluded due to specific technological design features of the equipment. For instance, the elevated operating temperatures of the Glass Melter would result in a high destruction and removal efficiency (99.9999% in test burns). In addition, the rapid cooling of the offgases below dioxin-forming temperatures, as recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency for municipal waste incinerators, would also be used to preclude dioxin formation. The worst reasonably foreseeable accident involving the Glass Melter would be a fire on the loading dock that would result in the complete vaporization of the contents of ten mixed waste storage drums. The estimated frequency of such an accident is once every 100,000 years. The effective dose equivalent to the maximally exposed individual [approximately 200 m (220 yd) downwind] would be 0.2 mrem, well below Environmental Protection Agency standards. The environmental assessment shows that the health risk from such exposures would be very small. Predicted concentrations of nonradiological pollutants would meet the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's maximum acceptable ground-level concentrations. Taking account of the low probability of such an event and the small magnitude of the consequences, the health risk posed by the accident is insignificant. No endangered species, critical habitats, floodplains, wetlands, or historical or archaeological resources would be affected by the proposed action. Alternatives Considered: In the environmental assessment, DOE considered two onsite alternatives to the proposed action and seven offsite alternatives in the context of the original proposed action (i.e., assuming the continuing operation of the Mound Plant). The discussion below, however, while being based on the environmental assessment, reflects the current proposed use of the Glass Melter following DOE's decision to close the Plant, which is to treat only mixed waste backlog. \u2022 No Action. The present practices of waste storage and disposal would continue and the Glass Melter would not be used. Most of the mixed waste backlog is liquid, and much of it is combustible. Storage of the untreated waste, therefore, could adversely impact human health and the environment, especially in the case of a fire in the storage facility. \u2022 Administrative Action. Another alternative would be to rely upon the established Mound Waste Minimization and Pollution Prevention program to identify, screen, and analyze options to reduce the generation of waste. Waste that is in storage would not be affected by this program. The need for treatment options would persist. \u2022 Offsite Treatment and Disposal. These alternatives would involve the transportation of mixed wastes to designated sites. DOE considered seven options for offsite treatment. All of the offsite treatment alternatives (i.e., all offsite alternatives except the Nevada Test Site) would involve thermal treatment. _ Quadrex HPS, Inc. (Gainesville, FL) .

(Other than the ``800'' number, these are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The existing lead-based paint regulations pertaining to the Department's programs were written pursuant to the passage of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4801&hyph;4846) in the early 1970s. This legislation required the Secretary to ``establish procedures to eliminate as far as practicable the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning with respect to any existing housing which may present such hazards and which is covered by an application for mortgage insurance or housing assistance payments under a program administered by the Secretary.'' HUD implemented that requirement by promulgating 24 CFR part 35 in 1976 (41 FR 28878, July 13, 1976). Part 35 includes the general procedures for the testing and abatement of lead-based paint hazards in HUD-associated housing and applies to all programs. Section 35.5(c), however, allows each Assistant Secretary to develop regulations pertaining to specific HUD programs. It is the Department's intent that program-specific regulations define the conditions that require action, but reference part 35 for specification of how the action should be conducted. Since part 35 was first written, amendments to it and to the program-specific regulations have been issued from time to time in response to changes in the law and increased knowledge about the hazards and treatment of lead-based paint. The most recent Department-wide regulatory revisions pertaining to lead-based paint were made in 1986, 1987, and 1988. Some additional revisions specific to the public and Indian housing programs were issued in 1991. However, new legislation_specifically the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102&hyph;550; approved October 28, 1992) (Title X)_and recent advances in knowledge have again made some of the information in the existing regulations obsolete. Therefore, the Department is undertaking a comprehensive revision of its lead-based paint regulations. The changes in this proposed rule would represent the first phase in the revision process. In the first phase, HUD would correct certain provisions in the regulations that are clearly out of date and should be corrected as soon as possible. Subsequent revisions will implement Title X, which establishes new requirements effective January 1, 1995. The Department intends to issue proposed regulations implementing the new Act as soon as possible, to allow the maximum amount of time for comment and for preparation by State and local agencies and the private sector. HUD welcomes comments on the regulatory revisions that are described in this proposed rule. Revising the Definition of an Elevated Blood-Lead Level Current regulations require special procedures if a child has an ``elevated blood-lead level.'' This proposed rule would change the definition of an elevated blood-lead level (EBL) to conform to the new recommendations of the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control (CDC), regarding blood lead levels that require environmental intervention. Existing regulations define an EBL as equal to or exceeding 25 micrograms per deciliter (\u03bcg/dl). The Department's new standard for environmental intervention would be equal to or exceeding 20 \u03bcg/dl for a single test or 15&hyph;19 \u03bcg/dl in two consecutive tests several months apart. Many people are under the impression that the CDC, in its Statement, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991), effectively lowered the definition of an EBL to 10 \u03bcg/dl. It is true that the Statement indicates that ``the overall goal is to reduce children's blood lead levels below 10 \u03bcg/dl. However, the Statement does not recommend medical or environmental intervention at levels of 10&hyph;14 \u03bcg/dl. Three reasons are given: First, particularly at low blood lead levels, laboratory measurements may have some inaccuracy and imprecision, so a blood lead level in this range (10&hyph;14 \u03bcg/dl) may, in fact, be below 10 \u03bcg/dl. Second, effective environmental and medical interventions for children with blood lead levels in this range have not yet been identified and evaluated. Finally, the sheer numbers of children in this range would preclude effective case management and would detract from individualized follow-up required by children who have higher blood lead levels. (See, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, Preventing Lead Poisoning in Young Children, A Statement by the Centers for Disease Control_October 1991, page 2.) The definition currently used by HUD of an EBL first appears in 24 CFR 200.805. The revised definition would be included in 24 CFR 35.3, because the definition affects all residential HUD programs. Specific program regulations could then reference the definition in part 35 as appropriate, although some program regulations might continue to repeat the definition.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940512-1-00088", "score": 6.588399887084961}, {"content": "Title: Content: DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 65 RIN 0905&hyph;AD69 National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Hazardous Waste Worker Training AGENCY: National Institutes of Health, Public Health Service, HHS. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is amending regulations governing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program authorized by section 118 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended by the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act of 1990. EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective January 12, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Chip Hughes, Worker Education and Training Program, Office of Disease Prevention, P. O. Box 12233, NIEHS, West Campus, MD WC&hyph;04, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, telephone (919) 541&hyph;0217 (this not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;615, enacted on November 16, 1990, amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) (49 U.S.C. Appendix 1801 et seq. ) by authorizing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health to administer a program of grants to qualified non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing training and education to hazardous materials employees regarding the safe unloading, loading, handling, storage and transportation of hazardous materials and emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents involving the transportation of hazardous materials in order to meet the training requirements issued under section 106(b) of the HMTA. Section 118 of the HMTA directs NIEHS to administer the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The grants are funded from the collection of fees, as specified under section 117A(h) of the HMTA, which are collected from the transporters of hazardous materials on an annual basis. Funds to support the grant program are transferred from DOT to NIEHS on an annual basis through an Interagency Agreement. This rule amends regulations at 42 CFR part 65 governing the NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker Training Grants Program to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program. Specifically, the authority citation for part 65 is amended to include the authority for the new training grants (49 U.S.C. App. 1816); \u00a765.1 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b) concluding text and (c) introductory text to set forth the applicability of part 65 to the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program; and \u00a765.2 is amended by deleting the definition of ``Act'' and adding definitions of the acronyms ``SARA'' and ``HMTA'' and by revising the definition of ``Award or grant.'' Additionally, references to ``section 126 of the Act'' found in sections 65.1, 65.4 and 65.5 of the part 65 are revised to read ``section 126 of the SARA or section 118 of the HMTA.'' Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law. Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941213-0-00036", "score": 6.583399772644043}, {"content": "Title: Content: DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29 CFR Parts 1910, 1915, 1917, 1918 and 1926 RIN 1218&hyph;AB02 Hazard Communication AGENCY: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Department of Labor. ACTION: Final rule; Temporary stay of effective date for wood products. SUMMARY: OSHA is staying until August 11, 1994 the coverage of the Hazardous Communication Standard to wood and wood products which will be processed in a manner which will create wood dust or which are treated with hazardous chemicals. This will allow more time to prepare labels and MSDS's. DATES: The stay is effective March 11, 1994 to August 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, room N3647, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, (202) 219&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published amendments to the existing Hazard Communication Standard which requires employers to establish hazard communication programs that would transmit information to employees by means of labels, manufacturer's safety data sheets (MSDS) and training. The amendment contained minor changes and technical amendments which went into effect March 11, 1994. One of those amendments made clear that wood products which were to be processed in a manner which would create wood dust or were treated with hazardous chemicals were covered by the standard. They would not be covered by the exemption for other wood and wood products in the Hazard Communication Standard. Warning labels and MSDS were appropriate for wood processed to create wood dust or treated with hazardous chemicals because of the health hazards that respiration of excess levels of those substances would cause. However, wood and wood products which only present the hazard of flammability do not need to be labeled because that hazard is common knowledge. Paragraph (b)(6)(iv) was amended to incorporate this clarification. As the Hazard Communication standard covers all industries covered by OSHA, that amendment was made in identical language to 29 CFR 1910.1200(b)(6)(iv) (General Industry), 1915.1200(b)(6)(iv) (Shipyards), 1917.28(b)(6)(iv) (Marine Terminals), 1918.90(b)(iv)(6) (Longshoring), and 1926.59(b)(6)(iv) (Construction). Agriculture was covered by cross reference to the General Industry standard. On March 4, 1994 OSHA was sent a letter by the American Forest and Paper Association which requested that this change be made effective August 11, 1994 and not March 11, 1994 as specified in the notice. OSHA viewed this change as a clarification because it was consistent with an interpretation OSHA had followed for several years. However many of its members had disagreed with OSHA's interpretation and one ALJ decision supported those members' view. Consequently they had not been labeling or supplying MSDS's when they shipped wood and wood products. It would take many of their members and other effected employers substantially more than 30 days to develop appropriate labels and MSDS's. OSHA concludes that this request is reasonable. Efforts by employers would be better spent in the next few months, from the perspective of worker health, developing and attaching protective labels and supplying MSDS rather than upon interpretive disputes. Accordingly OSHA is staying from March 11, 1994 until August 11, 1994 the effective date of that part of Paragraph (b)(6)(iv) which excludes from the wood dust exemption, wood and wood products which have been treated with hazardous chemicals or which would be sawed or otherwise processed to create wood dust. This stay applies to all sectors covered by OSHA. OSHA is adding a note following the regulatory text of the Hazard Communication standard in parts 1910, 1915, 1917, 1918 and 1926 to implement this stay. Agriculture is covered through the cross reference in 29 CFR 1928.21 to the General Industry standard. All other amendments to the hazard communication standard became effective March 11, 1994 as stated in the final rule. Notice and comment is unnecessary pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 and paragraph 6(b) of the OSH Act because this stay is brief and will facilitate concentrating efforts to come into compliance.

As RSPA noted in 1980, in its first notice of proposed rulemaking to regulate hazardous substances as hazardous materials: DOT should not attempt to develop the criteria for materials that are subject to the FWPCA unless they fall within the realm of the existing defining criteria for materials presently designated as hazardous materials. (RSPA) believes the EPA has both the expertise and the technical resources necessary to deal with the determination and designation of those materials which should be considered for inclusion in the reporting requirement mandated by the FWPCA. 44 FR 10677. The assignment of authority under the FWPCA and CERCLA between DOT and the EPA reflects the agencies' relative areas of expertise and resources. Both 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 9602(a) direct the EPA Administrator to designate as hazardous substances those materials that may substantially endanger public health or the environment, and to establish for each the RQ that determines which hazardous substance releases must be reported. Both the decision to designate a material as a hazardous substance and the choice of an RQ are matters for the exercise of the EPA Administrator's broad discretion. The assignment to RSPA under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), conversely, is strictly confined: if the EPA has designated a material as a hazardous substance, RSPA must list it and regulate its transportation. The rulemaking challenged by petitioners was preceded by a notice and comment rulemaking in which the EPA affirmed its designation of lead sulfide as a hazardous substance, and determined that on the basis of chronic toxicity, the lead sulfide in petitioners' concentrates warranted assignment of an RQ of 10 pounds. 58 FR 35316. If RSPA were to consider petitioners' argument that the low bioavailability of the lead sulfide in their concentrates justifies excepting the concentrates from the hazardous material designation, the result would be untenable. In every rulemaking under section 9656(a), RSPA would be required to consider, on a cost-benefit basis, the appropriate level of Federal hazmat regulation for each hazardous substance designated by the EPA and the appropriateness of excluding certain forms of hazardous substances from regulation entirely. Costs and benefits could not be estimated without RSPA independently assessing the health and environmental risks that a hazardous substance posed. The statute cannot reasonably intend that each hazardous substance and RQ designation, determined by the EPA through consideration of public comment and the exercise of its own expert judgment, be subject to full reconsideration by RSPA before it is incorporated into the HMR. This reading would be contrary to the statutory recognition of agency expertise and all notions of executive branch efficiency and consistency. RSPA does have discretion as to precisely how it regulates hazardous substances in transportation. Regulation may be extensive or minimal. Vehicle operating requirements, segregation requirements and routing restrictions might be imposed, or shipping paper and package notations might suffice. RSPA's task is to formulate a principle that reconciles (1) the EPA's authority to adjudge public health and environmental risk by designating hazardous substances and their RQ's with (2) RSPA's inescapable discretion to determine the specific requirements that apply to the transportation of each hazardous substance. The guiding principle is this: RSPA, in its discretion, may prescribe reasonable requirements to govern the safe transportation of hazardous substances, so long as those requirements do not, in effect, revisit the EPA's assessment of health and environmental risks. In practice, this means that RSPA may exercise discretion under 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) in three respects: (1) It may prescribe regulations for the transportation of hazardous substances as a class ; (2) it may regulate differently hazardous substances with different RQ's; and (3) it may regulate hazardous substances by class on the basis of shared characteristics other than the degree of health or environmental risk posed. C. Petitioners' Substantive Claims Petitioners contend that although RSPA must ``list and regulate'' all hazardous substances as hazardous materials, it has the discretion to except copper, molybdenum and zinc concentrates from the hazardous material designation. In support of this claim, petitioners suggest that RSPA already has exercised this sort of discretion under 49 CFR 171.8, by: (1) Regulating hazardous substances only when transported in excess of their RQ's; and (2) not regulating mixtures and solutions containing a hazardous substance, when the hazardous substance is below a specified concentration. Petitioners ask that RSPA merely amend the rule governing mixtures and solutions to increase the concentration of lead sulfide that must be present in their concentrates before they are considered hazardous materials. Petitioners argue that the exception from regulation for hazardous substances in amounts below their RQ's and for those in mixtures or solutions below the specified concentration proves that RSPA has the discretion to disregard the 42 U.S.C. 9656(a) command to ``list and regulate'' each hazardous substance. These exceptions, however, do not contravene the statute, but implement it. As discussed above, the primary purpose of section 9656(a) is to provide for identification of cargo subject to CERCLA reporting requirements if released. There is no need to regulate a hazardous substance being transported in an amount below its RQ, because no reportable release could occur during transportation. 42 U.S.C. 9603(b); cf. 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(5). The provision setting a minimum concentration for designating as a hazardous material a hazardous substance in a mixture or in solution is to simplify the operator's task of determining whether an RQ of a hazardous substance is present. 45 FR 34569; 44 FR 10676&hyph;77. Further, the statute requires reporting of a hazardous substance release only when the release equals or exceeds the RQ of the substance. 42 U.S.C. 9603(a). This is an implied finding that the release of a limited quantity of a hazardous substance is of lesser regulatory concern. Cf . 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(4) (defining the RQ as the quantity of a hazardous substance ``which may be harmful'' to the public health or welfare or the environment).", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR940831-0-00068", "score": 6.566500186920166}, {"content": "Title: Content: A second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three isomers was confirmed when detected, and the combined concentration of the three compounds was quantified. Because the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, any one of the coeluting contaminants could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. Therefore, the Agency evaluated coeluting compounds with health-based levels independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated by the constituents, in this case 2-aminotoluene, to ensure that risk was not underestimated. The volume of 2-aminotoluene consumed as a raw material, based on 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, is approximately 9 times that of the other isomers. In addition, aromatic amines with substitutions in the 2- and 4- positions of the aromatic ring are used in the manufacture of azo dyes much more frequently than those substituted in the 3- position. Therefore, any impurities or breakdown products from aromatic amines are likely to be substituted in the 2- and 4- positions. 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene also coelute on the GC/MS curve. Both compounds are likely oxidation products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that either contaminant may be present at all or part of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated these coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated. As with azobenzene and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine coelute on the GC/MS curve and are likely by-products resulting from the oxidation of aniline. As stated above, the Agency evaluated these coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated. The Agency requests comments on the approach used to assess risk when compounds that coelute were detected in the wastestream, and on alternative approaches that commenters may develop. 3. Risk Analysis Risk Characterization Approach The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments will be expected to include (1) the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, and (2) important subgroups of the populations such as highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known. In addition to the presentation of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures with a discussion of uncertainties. These documents are available in the public docket for this action (see ADDRESSES section). Individual Risk Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population, and the risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route; (2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating individual risk for likely exposure pathways that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor. Risk Assessment The results of the risk assessment are presented in waste-specific risk tables in each of the basis for listing sections (Section II.E.). The risk tables include the following information: Constituents of concern; estimated human health risk associated with the current and plausible management scenarios; high, low, and average concentrations of constituents found in this wastestream; the number of samples in which the constituent was detected; notes regarding ``J-values'' (see Section II.B on Data Uncertainties); and industry-submitted data. In addition to those compounds presented in the waste-specific risk tables, the Agency's characterization data include a number of compounds identified as present in the waste but for which no health benchmarks exist. In addition, other compounds which do have health benchmarks have been identified in these wastes but were dropped from further consideration following the risk screening because the risks were projected to be below levels of concern. The risk tables presented in this preamble do not contain these additional constituents. The complete list of constituents found in each of the wastes generated from the manufacture of dyes and pigments, an explanation of the risk screening process, and an explanation of EPA's development of the target analyte list are presented in the Listing and Health Effects Background Documents for this proposed rule, which are located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See ADDRESSES section). The analysis of risk was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modeling of exposure from baseline (or current) waste management practices and other plausible management scenarios. Pursuant to the Agency's regulations on listing hazardous wastes, EPA considers the ``plausible types of improper management to which the waste could be subjected'', 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Thus, plausible management is one of the waste management scenarios used by EPA to assess the risks to human health and the environment from the disposal of the wastes under consideration. The choice of ``plausible management'' depends on a combination of factors which are discussed in Section II.A, ``EPA's Listing Determination Process.'' The following discussion explains the plausible management scenarios used to assess risk for each of the waste groups addressed in this proposal. The Agency requests comment on its choice of plausible management scenarios and on the possibility of using alternative plausible management scenarios.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00036", "score": 6.558599948883057}, {"content": "Title: Content: February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition U.S. BUREAUCRACY BLAMED IN CONFINED-SPACE DEATHS Just before dawn on Dec. 5, a fellow worker found Dennis Claypool and Mark DeMoss lying dead on their backs in a large tanker-trailer they had been directed to clean at a trucking company 60 miles south of Chicago. The two young men had died in the same way as about 3,000 other workers in the last decade: by breathing unsafe air in enclosed work spaces. In this case, federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials have concluded that DeMoss, 18, and Claypool, 21, died because all the oxygen had been sucked out of the tanker during a chemical operation two days earlier. Claypool's father, Philip, a Morris, Ill., carpenter, and occupational safety experts said the deaths of his son and DeMoss are symbolic of a striking failure by regulators. Every year, about 300 workers die in such incidents nationwide, and all of them die needlessly, according to John Moran, former director of safety research for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Unlike many health and safety issues affecting the workplace, there is little disagreement over the need for federal standards to regulate work in what are referred to as \"confined spaces.\" Some employer groups, as well as numerous unions, have been among those urging the government to adopt such standards. In fact, OSHA itself first acknowledged in 1975 the need to set safety standards for workers entering and working in confined spaces. That was 14 years ago, but standards still have not been issued. In the meantime, according to Moran's figures, more than 4,000 people have been asphyxiated, poisoned or died in explosions in boilers, sewers, refinery tanks, silos, airplane wings and other confined spaces. Many of those died trying to rescue their co-workers. \"This is a clear example of the failure of OSHA to act in an area where people are getting killed,\" said Margaret Seminario, associate director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO. \"It's such a clear hazard and there's no question that it's feasible to do something.\" Outline Exists for 10 Years The formal outline of how federal OSHA could regulate \"confined space\" entries has existed since 1979, when NIOSH presented OSHA with a 68-page document describing the criteria for a standard. Since then, OSHA personnel have written several drafts but never took any action. Only a few days before Claypool and DeMoss died, OSHA finally finished its confined-space proposal and sent it to the Office of Management and Budget. The budget agency must approve the proposal before OSHA can formally present it for public hearings. A knowledgeable source in federal OSHA said the standard differs \"very little\" from the last major draft, completed in June, 1985. The source said that for the last three years Labor Department lawyers have been tinkering with the proposal and writing a lengthy preamble to the standard. Tom Seymour, OSHA's deputy for safety standards programs, acknowledged that confined-space deaths are a \"serious problem\" and that federal regulations are \"long overdue.\" It should not have taken so long to get a standard written, Seymour said in a telephone interview. \"Part of the problem (for the delay) has been priorities,\" he said, indicating that the agency considered other issues more pressing. Administration Opposition But union representatives and other safety and health officials asserted that much of the delay was due to the stated philosophical opposition of the Reagan Administration to adopting more regulations. \"This reflects the Reagan Administration's knee-jerk, anti-regulation outlook which has obstructed all OSHA rule-making,\" said Frank Mirer, the United Auto Workers' health and safety director. Confined-space deaths are hardly a matter of concern only to union officials and safety engineers. At least some elements of corporate America say they have urged OSHA to act. \"People are dying every year; industries recognize that,\" said Jo Anne Linhardt, a safety expert for Organization Resources Counselors Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm that gives professional assistance to numerous Fortune 500 companies. She said her organization had sent suggestions to federal OSHA on what should be in a confined space standard, as have several unions and professional safety groups, including the Water Pollution Control Federation. Characteristics Listed A \"confined space\" is described by occupational safety experts as a space with any of the following characteristics: * Small openings for entry and exit. * Unfavorable natural ventilation. * An area not designed for continuous worker occupancy. The two most commonly occurring hazards in confined spaces, according to Moran, are oxygen deficiency and potentially explosive conditions created by the presence of methane gas. The deaths generally occur when a worker enters a confined space not knowing that there is a lack of oxygen or that the air is pervaded by toxic chemicals that can swiftly be fatal. The recent Illinois case appears to be a classic example, as was an incident in Burbank in 1981 when two city workers were overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas when they entered a manhole, unaware of the hazard. In the Illinois case, there was insufficient oxygen in the tanker that Claypool and DeMoss entered because, two days earlier, a chemical company had used nitrogen to remove a shipment of dodane, a liquid used in making detergent, from the tanker, according to state and federal officials. Nitrogen, an odorless, colorless gas, sucks oxygen out of the air. There was no sign on the tanker warning that breathing could be difficult, according to a wrongful death suit filed by Claypool's parents. Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the confined-space problem is that the vast majority of the calamities involve multiple fatalities. Generally at least one would-be rescuer perishes, as well as the original victim, according to government studies. Five Men Die For example, last June five young men died in a confined-space incident at Bastian Plating, a small company in Auburn, Ind. They were asphyxiated by hydrogen cyanide gas, which was created when Jeff Link was cleaning a 5-foot-deep tank. Four of Link's colleagues died from the same fumes while trying to rescue him. Craig Fogle, 19, was the last. Fogle's mother, Brenda, a waitress, is now campaigning to get a federal law passed in hope that such tragedies will not recur. \"The four boys tried to save the first one,\" she said. \"It was such a waste.\" Ted Tomczak, a federal OSHA official who has been working on the confined-space issue for almost five years, goes further. \"The core of the problem is rescues,\" he said. \"To lose additional people trying to make an impossible rescue -- that borders on criminal.\" Moran agreed. He said that NIOSH's division of safety research did detailed investigation of 39 confined-space incidents from 1984 to 1987. The investigations took place in 17 states, ranging from California to Vermont, and covered a wide range of industries, including tanker trucks, aerospace and waste water treatment. The research revealed that 31% of the companies at which incidents occurred had written confined-space entry procedures but that none of the companies had used them. Only 15% of the companies had trained their workers on confined-space hazards; none of the companies had a rescue plan; 43% of the victims were would-be rescuers; 95% of the entries had been authorized by supervisors and 29% of those who died were supervisors. None of the spaces were evaluated or tested (for oxygen or chemical content) before entry and none of the spaces were ventilated. Deaths Were Avoidable \"None of these fatalities would have occurred if the NIOSH confined-spaces recommendations in the 1979 criteria document had been followed,\" Moran said. And reports of individual NIOSH investigations describe a series of grim incidents: \"Three sanitation workers and one policeman die in an an underground sewage pumping station in Kentucky\"; \"Truck driver suffocates in sawdust bin in Pennsylvania\"; \"Two workers die in underground valve pit in Oklahoma\"; \"Insufficient oxygen level in sewer claims the life of plumbing contractor in Georgia,\" and on and on. In their defense, federal OSHA officials said that they have not been powerless to respond to these tragic incidents. In numerous instances, they have cited employers responsible for confined-space deaths by using the \"general duty clause,\" a catchall provision of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act designed to plug holes in instances where there has been a fatality or a serious life-threatening hazard. For example, federal OSHA's Long Beach office cited Continental Truck Wash on South Central Avenue and fined the company after a worker was killed there in an explosion on Nov. 10, 1987, while cleaning a truck tank that had recently contained aviation fuel. The fine was $1,400. Michael Wright, health and safety director of the United Steelworkers of America, one of the unions most actively advocating enactment of a confined-space standard, said that general duty clause citations were better than no action at all. However, he said that such citations are tougher to sustain, if challenged in court, than citations based on a specific standard, such as one regulating the amount of airborne asbestos that can be present in a workplace. Primarily Punitive More importantly, Wright said, general duty clause citations are primarily a punitive tool rather than a preventive tool. He said that inspectors \"rarely\" are able to issue such citations on a routine inspection before an accident occurs. \"They're generally used after serious accidents,\" which is important, he said. \"But the whole purpose of OSHA is to prevent the accident, not just to penalize someone afterward. . . . I can't understand why it's taken them so long to write a standard.\" OSHA's Tomczak said the process of drawing up the proposed confined-space standard had been long and \"very frustrating.\" He said he could not provide a copy of the proposed standard until it had been cleared by the Office of Management and Budget. However, he was willing to describe some of its components. \"We are demanding that the employer have a program to identify the (confined) spaces, identify hazards, evaluate their severity, determine proper controls for all the hazards, entry procedures, training and permits,\" Tomczak said. The reason for having a written permit, he said, is to make sure that the entry has been authorized and that all the proper procedures have been followed. Tomczak said such a system was designed to ensure that \"in case something goes wrong, everyone knows what to do, where to go for help and how to get the people out of the space.\" Charles Conner, director of safety for the Los Angeles County Sanitation District, also said it would be useful to have a federal standard that provided clear criteria on how confined-space entries should be handled. Conner said the use of proper safety procedures and good training of employees could vastly cut down these deaths. He said there were no confined-space deaths among county sanitation district workers in the last decade, even though waste water treatment work is quite hazardous. Discussion Set Monday Officials of OSHA and the Office of Management and Budget will meet in Washington on Monday to have their first formal discussion of the proposal. OSHA's Seymour said there already are indications that OMB will oppose a major component of OSHA's proposal -- the requirement of a written permit system -- creating the clear possibility of further delay. Still, he said, he is hopeful that the proposal will be cleared by OMB \"before summer\" and that it can go into effect later in the year. Meanwhile, Claypool continues to grieve and has formed an organization called You're Not Forgotten, designed to provide moral support to the family members of victims of industrial accidents. \"No one should have to go through what we're going through,\" said Claypool, referring both to his family's mourning and OSHA's failure to act. Claypool has been given moral support by Joseph Kinney, president of the Chicago-based National Safe Workplace Institute, an organization Kinney formed in 1987 after his brother died in a scaffolding accident. Kinney asserted that the long delay in enacting a confined space standard showed how the goal of improving workplace safety and health in this country had been perverted into an \"abstract exercise in law and economics\" by some government officials who set certain litmus tests that had to be met for regulations to go into effect. \"Let's bias things in favor of safety and work backwards, rather than the opposite, which is what is done now,\" Kinney said. \"If George Bush wants to make this a 'kinder and gentler nation,' one thing he could do is to get confined-space regulations enacted as soon as possible.\"", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA020589-0196", "score": 6.558499813079834}, {"content": "Title: Content: Food and Drug Administration [Docket No. 94N&hyph;0196] Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Systems; Invitation to Participate in a Voluntary HACCP Pilot Program for the Food Manufacturing Industry AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it intends to conduct a pilot program in which volunteers from the food manufacturing industry will use the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. This pilot program is intended to provide information that FDA can use in deciding whether to propose to adopt and, should it decide to do so, in developing and implementing a regulatory system in which food manufacturers are required to operate based on HACCP principles. FDA expects that the pilot program will involve a small number of firms making products presenting a range of risks. FDA is inviting individual firms that wish to participate in this program to submit letters of interest. DATES: Letters of interest from individual firms must be submitted by October 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit letters of interest to the Office of Policy, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (HFS&hyph;4), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John E. Kvenberg, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;4), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;4010. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq ), FDA acts to help ensure that foods in interstate commerce are safe. To achieve this goal of safe foods, FDA engages in a range of activities, including providing guidance about measures that manufacturers can take to ensure the safety of their products. One such measure is the adoption of HACCP, a systematic approach to the identification and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with the production of a particular food. HACCP is recognized as being particularly effective in limiting the risks from the hazards presented by food processing because each firm tailors the HACCP approach to fit its specific product, processing, and distribution conditions. For example, the low-acid canned food regulations contained in part 113 (21 CFR part 113) incorporate the principles of HACCP in a manner designed to prevent Clostridium botulinum outgrowth and toxin production in thermally processed, low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers. In the Federal Register of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA published a proposal to establish regulations to require the implementation of HACCP programs by the seafood industry. The agency is now considering action to extend HACCP beyond seafood to the other food products, domestic and imported, that it regulates. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register , FDA intends to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that requests comments on the application of HACCP to the food industry. After the comments to the ANPRM are evaluated and as FDA gathers information from the pilot program that is the subject of this notice, the agency may begin rulemaking to expand HACCP to other segments of the food industry. To collect information on how HACCP might be implemented in the food industry, FDA is announcing a pilot program designed to provide insight into the problems, costs, and benefits of developing and implementing HACCP for firms that produce a variety of food products. This program will also provide the agency with information on the implications for the agency of implementing a HACCP system. The agency invites individual firms to submit letters of interest in participating in this voluntary program. FDA will select firms with a goal of ensuring that the participants in the program produce products that present a range of potential hazards, have a range of scientific capabilities, have processing facilities of varying sizes, and have a range of HACCP experience. FDA anticipates that this program will provide the selected firm as well as the agency with extremely useful practical experience. The potential benefits to industry from participation in the pilot program include: (1) An opportunity to work with FDA to determine how best to apply HACCP in the firm's particular plant or segment of the food industry, (2) the chance to engage in a scientific dialogue with FDA, (3) an opportunity to contribute to the development of sound regulatory policy relative to food safety hazards, and (4) an opportunity to learn how firms can reduce the likelihood of recalls or seizures. Participation in this pilot program offers several benefits to FDA and to the consumer: (1) Experience gained during this program may allow the agency to generalize what it has found and to make its insights available to the whole food industry, (2) the agency will gain experience that it can rely on in deciding whether HACCP is practicable for the food industry as a whole, and (3) the agency will be able to determine how it can better focus its monitoring of food safety to concentrate on areas of greatest public health need. Moreover, the agency intends to make a summary of the results of the pilot program publicly available, which should help other firms, both inside and outside the segments of the food industry represented in the program, to develop and implement their own HACCP programs, should they choose to do so, or should the agency require that they do so. This will also serve to increase public understanding of, and involvement in this new food safety regimen. FDA requests that individual firms submitting letters of interest provide information concerning the nature of their products, the size of their processing facility, the processing techniques that they use to manufacture their products, their scientific capability (e.g., research and development programs, quality control laboratories), and the extent to which, and how, they employ HACCP (e.g., Does the firm have valid HACCP plans? Is it operating under those plans? If not, does the firm have the capability to develop and implement HACCP plans?). FDA will consider these factors in reviewing the letters of interest as a basis for identifying a limited number of individual firms that, in the judgment of the agency, are best suited to participate in the program. After a list of potential participants has been compiled, FDA will review the regulatory status and inspectional history of each firm on the list. FDA will meet with the firms that have expressed an interest in participating in the program. At this meeting, FDA will present the details of the voluntary HACCP pilot program. If a firm is still interested in participation in the program, it will be visited by the team of FDA employees that will be responsible for the pilot program (the FDA HACCP Pilot Core Team) and by representatives of the local FDA district office. Representatives of a trade association may also participate in the visit if invited by the firm. The purpose of the visit will be to allow FDA to assess how well the firm fits within the agency's goals for the pilot program and to review the firm's HACCP plan, if one exists. Based on the results of these visits, the FDA HACCP Pilot Core Team will select the firms that will participate in the program. Because FDA's resources are limited, only a few firms can be selected. Each firm selected to participate in the pilot program will be expected to design, develop, and implement its own HACCP program tailored to control the hazards presented in producing its products and by its processing facility. FDA will assist each firm that it selects in developing a HACCP program that, at minimum, includes: An employee training program on HACCP principles; a written general sanitation program that the firm will use to maintain its production facility in a sanitary manner, in accordance with FDA's regulation, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (21 CFR part 110); and a written HACCP plan based upon the HACCP principles outlined by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food for each product covered by the program. FDA will expect each firm that participates in the program to agree to: (1) FDA review of its HACCP program before the firm participates in the pilot program, (2) FDA HACCP-based inspections of its processing facility, (3) FDA review of the firm's regularly scheduled internal monitoring to determine the degree of compliance with the HACCP plan, and (4) use of its own resources to accomplish assigned efforts (e.g., developing HACCP plans, training employees on the HACCP principles, conducting audits of HACCP programs) during the course of the program. FDA intends to implement this program on a carefully controlled basis. Within 6 weeks of the date that a firm is accepted and operational in its HACCP program, FDA will conduct an initial verification inspection to determine the firm's compliance with its HACCP program. The firm will be expected to submit monthly verification reports to the FDA HACCP Pilot Core Team for evaluation. FDA will conduct subsequent verification inspections as appropriate. Interested firms are invited to submit a letter of interest to Office of Policy, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (HFS&hyph;4), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. Letters of interest must be submitted by October 3, 1994. Dated: July 28, 1994. Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Commissioner for Policy.

Such State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, these State regulations will not be deemed as RCRA requirements until the State program modification is submitted to EPA and approved. Of course, States with existing regulations may continue to administer and enforce those regulations as a matter of State law. In addition, in implementing the Federal program, EPA will work with the States under cooperative agreements to minimize duplication of efforts; in many cases, EPA will be able to defer to the States in their efforts to implement their programs, rather than take separate actions under Federal authority. States that submit their official applications for final authorization less than 12 months after the effective date of EPA's regulations are not required to include regulations equivalent to the EPA regulations in their application. However, States must modify their programs by the deadlines set forth in 40 CFR 271.21(e). States that submit official applications for final authorization 12 months after the effective date of these standards must include standards equivalent to these standards in their application. The requirements States must meet when submitting final authorization applications are set forth in 40 CFR 271.3. VII. CERCLA Designation and RQ Adjustment All hazardous wastes listed in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that meets one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined at 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), pursuant to CERCLA Section 101(14) 42 U.S.C. 9601 (14)(c). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). Therefore, in addition to the K140 listing being proposed today for 40 CFR 261.32 and the U408 listing being proposed for 40 CFR 261.33, entries for K140 and U408 also are being proposed for Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4. Reporting Requirements. Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or facility from which a hazardous substance has been released in a quantity that equals or exceeds its RQ must immediately notify the National Response Center of the release (see 40 CFR part 302). 1 In addition to this reporting requirement under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11004, requires owners or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities. EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given immediately after the release of an RQ or more to the community emergency coordinator of the local emergency planning committee for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the State emergency planning commission of any State likely to be affected by the release. 1 The toll free telephone number of the National Response Center is 800&hyph;424&hyph;8802; in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is 202&hyph;267&hyph;2675. Adjustment of RQs. Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous wastes newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of one pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. The Agency's methodology for adjusting RQs of individual hazardous substances begins with an evaluation of the intrinsic physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of each hazardous substance. 2 The intrinsic properties examined_called ``primary criteria''_are aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity (oral, dermal, and inhalation), ignitability, reactivity, chronic toxicity, and potential carcinogenicity. Generally, for each intrinsic property, the Agency ranks hazardous substances on a scale, associating a specific range of values on each scale with an RQ of 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 5000 pounds. The data for each hazardous substance are evaluated using various primary criteria; each hazardous substance may receive several tentative RQ values based on its particular intrinsic properties. The lowest of the tentative RQs becomes the ``primary criteria RQ'' for that substance. 2 For more detailed information on this methodology, see the preamble to an RQ adjustment final rule published on August 14, 1989 (54 FR 33426). A different methodology is used to assign adjusted RQs to radionuclides (see 54 FR 22524, May 24, 1989). After the primary criteria RQs are assigned, substances are further evaluated for their susceptibility to certain degradative processes, which are used as secondary adjustment criteria. These natural degradative processes are biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis (BHP). If a hazardous substance, when released into the environment, degrades relatively rapidly to a less hazardous form by one or more of the BHP processes, its RQ (as determined by the primary RQ adjustment criteria) is generally raised one level. 3 This adjustment is made because the relative potential for harm to public health or welfare or the environment posed by the release of such a substance is reduced by these degradative processes. Conversely, if a hazardous substance degrades to a more hazardous product after its release, the original substance is assigned an RQ equal to the RQ for the more hazardous substance, which may be one or more levels lower than the RQ for the original substance. The downward adjustment is appropriate because the hazard posed by the release of the original substance is increased as a result of BHP. 3 No RQ level increase based on BHP occurs if the primary criteria RQ is already at its highest possible level (100 pounds for potential carcinogens and 5000 pounds for all other types of hazardous substances except radionuclides).

NINETEEN PEOPLE HAVE DIED OF A BLOOD DISORDER LINKED TO THE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday expanded its recall of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan to include even small dosages, declaring that the substance poses a \"major public health problem\" and can be fatal. The agency cited 1,411 reported cases of the newly recognized condition eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, which has been linked to L-tryptophan. Nineteen deaths have been reported. \"EMS can cripple. It can cause great pain. It can kill,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said in a statement. \"It has had long-term effects on some unfortunate individuals, and some patients are not responding to treatment.\" EMS is a blood disorder that can cause breathing problems, coughs, skin rashes, swelling of the extremities, fever and muscle weakness. Some patients have displayed signs of congestive heart failure or have developed a potentially fatal condition, ascending polyneuropathy. The condition involves gradual progressive weakness, often starting in the legs and moving upward, sometimes to the point of complete paralysis. \"I urge everyone to stop taking these supplements immediately,\" Sullivan said. L-tryptophan has been sold over the counter and has been used for insomnia, depression, stress reduction, premenstrual syndrome and appetite control. Until Thursday's action, the Nov. 17 recall was confined to L-tryptophan products that would result in a daily intake of 100 milligrams or more of the amino acid. This was based on information from the federal Centers for Disease Control and state public health agencies that those suffering from EMS had taken from 150 to 17,000 milligrams a day. But the FDA said there is at least one reported instance where an individual's intake was believed to be less than 100 milligrams. The only products with L-tryptophan not subject to recall are some protein supplements, infant formulas and special dietary foods, in which minute amounts of the substance are needed for nutrient fortification. There have been no reported cases of EMS from the use of these products, the FDA said. The expanded action was taken at the recommendation of the agency's Health Hazard Evaluation Board, a panel of scientists within the FDA's center for food safety and applied nutrition. \"The risk of contracting EMS due to the consumption of any dietary L-tryptophan product far outweighs any perceived benefit . . . in any dosage form,\" the board said in a statement. By mid-November, the CDC had recorded 287 illnesses and four deaths. The precise relationship between L-tryptophan and the disorder is not clear. EMS involves abnormally high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. A normal count is less than 500 cells per cubic millimeter of blood, while individuals taking L-tryptophan have experienced levels up to more than 32,000. J. B. Cordaro, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, the trade association for the nutritional supplements industry, endorsed the stepped-up recall. \"We believe this suggests the FDA must be closer to identifying the nature of the problem, which we suspect is a contaminant,\" he said. \"We are hopeful that the specific problem is identified in the very near future so that we can reintroduce L-tryptophan into the marketplace.\"", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA032390-0070", "score": 6.542500019073486}, {"content": "Title: Content: September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition CHEVRON FINED $877,000 FOR REFINERY FIRE The Labor Department said Tuesday that it would fine Chevron U.S.A.

The Chevron fire started April 10, when a pipe carrying pressurized hydrogen gas burst a seam. The resulting fire and explosion weakened a 100-foot-tall reactor, which collapsed and engulfed four workers in flames. Three, who were wearing no fire-resistant clothing, suffered second- and third-degree burns on up to 70% of their bodies, OSHA found in its subsequent investigation of the accident. 'Serious Violations' The fourth employee, who was wearing fire-resistant clothing, suffered only minor burns on his face, OSHA said. Five other employees suffered less serious injuries, OSHA reported. OSHA is citing Chevron with 109 \"willful violations\" -- one for each of 109 employees who were expected to fight fires or assist in fighting fires but who did not receive protective clothing, the agency said. Penalties for those violations amount to $872,000. OSHA defined a willful violation as one in which an employer knew of a hazard but made no reasonable effort to correct it. In addition, OSHA is citing Chevron with five \"serious violations,\" each carrying a penalty of $1,000. They include failing to provide fire-resistant coveralls to refinery personnel. The agency defined a serious violation as one in which there is a substantial probability that death or serious injury could result from a condition, and the employer knew or should have known of the hazard. Chevron disputed the need to provide fire protective clothing to employees, although a spokesman admitted the company has changed its policy to provide fire resistant coveralls to some refinery personnel. The refinery has resumed production at its normal level of 265,000 barrels a day, though the damaged equipment remains out of service, said Chevron spokesman Mike Libbey.", "qid": 350, "docid": "LA092789-0107", "score": 6.529300212860107}, {"content": "Title: Content: Subparts B&hyph;G_[Reserved] 40 CFR Chapter I Part 745 of 40 CFR Chapter I which was proposed to be added on March 9, 1994, at 59 FR 11116 would be further amended as follows: PART 745_LEAD EXPOSURE REDUCTION 1.

Obviously, the percentage should be lower in ecologically sound regions and much higher in zones of ecological problems and crises (and at least 15 percent of Russia's territory falls into these categories). It is also obvious that someone must take responsibility for health impairments beyond the citizen's control. Finally, it is also obvious that the protracted absence of state concern for this connection between the state of public health and the state of the environment has led to one of the most substantial threats to national security because the average lifespan--one of the general statistical indicators of national health--has been plunging disastrously since 1986. When we say that the state must defend the rights and freedoms of the individual and that individual rights are above all other rights and freedoms, we are also referring to the now constitutionally secured right to compensation for health impairments resulting from the deterioration of environmental quality. At the beginning of 1992, just after the Russian Federation laws \"On Sanitary-Epidemiological Welfare\" and \"On Environmental Protection\" were passed, it became obvious that the exercise of the right of citizens, declared in these laws, to compensation for health impairments caused by environmental factors would require additional legal and analytical work. We need standards and rules stipulating the actions that victims can take to protect themselves from the unfair judicial actions of polluting enterprises. What these victims need even more, however, is reliable proof that a specific impairment is caused directly by the pollution of the environment from a specific source. Without this information, they cannot expect a court to hear the case and rule in favor of the injured party. As a result of the intense work of a team of specialists, mainly connected with Gossanepidnadzor [State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight] and begun in spring 1992 under the auspices of the Russian Presidential Council on Ecological Policy, a set of standards and rules was drafted. The draft has already been \"under discussion\" in the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Economics for more than a year, and the end of this process is not in sight. I can appreciate the difficulties this kind of deliberation entails: This document would grant citizens rights comparable to the right to protect personal inviolability and the right to own property. In view of these difficulties, a decision was made to enlist the aid of epidemiologists in the codification of the effects of specific environmental pollutants on various health indicators--in a format suitable for a judicial hearing. It was not possible to achieve all of these goals: The information that is being published today sometimes sounds more like a scientific treatise than the anticipated set of guidelines, but even the results to date are important enough to publish. The effects of other ecological factors of human origin on human health--chemicals, as well as noise, radiation, and others--will also be analyzed in the future. We hope that this research will eventually be recognized as the official set of standards and guidelines. Armed with an awareness of the general state of affairs and the effects of pollution on his own health and the health of his children and grandchildren, each individual will choose his own method of avoiding this potential danger--by leaving the zone affected by the pollutant or be uniting with other affected citizens and forcing the polluter (through various channels, including judicial proceedings) to stop the pollution. Therefore, the report that is being published today was written, on the one hand, for the public--to inform each citizen and offer more effective protection of the right of each citizen to a healthy environment--and, on the other, for the administrators and owners of sources (irrespective of forms of ownership) of dangerous chemical pollution, so that they will stop the hazardous emissions and dumping without waiting for legal judgments against them. We wish to thank the newspaper and its special \"Prescription\" supplement for this publication--it is addressed to literally each person in Russia. An applied science conference will be held soon on \"Problems of Public Rehabilitation in Zones of Ecological Damage.\" The conference will be held by an association of trade unions in regions with unhealthy ecological conditions and by the International Fund for Socioecological Aid. Through the efforts of these organizations, the participants in the conference should receive our report in the form of a brochure to be used as a guide for action. These may just be the first tentative steps, but they are signs of progress....", "qid": 350, "docid": "FBIS4-21378", "score": 6.523099899291992}, {"content": "Title: Content: The calculated risks associated with managing these wastewaters in surface impoundments are very high. Three constituents are considered to pose a substantial potential hazard to human health and the environment ( i.e. , risks exceed 1E&hyph;4). Calculated risks for each of these three compounds are 1E&hyph;4. Three of the constituents that have been projected to pose a risk greater than 1E&hyph;6, namely, acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet- o -toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet- o -anisidide (AAOA), are high-volume coupling reactants used in the manufacture of azo pigments. As explained above for K162, these constituents are dominant raw materials in the azo pigment manufacturing industry and generally are present in the wastewater treatment systems at these sites. As shown in Table II&hyph;5, the risks calculated by these compounds range from 1E&hyph;4 to 1E&hyph;6. As stated for K162, these risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships (SAR) for these compounds, an approach which is discussed in detail in Section II.D of this preamble, and in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See ADDRESSES section). Table II&hyph;4, presented earlier, shows that AAA and AAOA were detected in all of the wastewater samples collected from facilities that use these reactants. AAOT was found only in one of four wastewater samples, but it was found in all four of the sludge samples collected from facilities using the compound. The Agency believes that the latter compound generally is present in the wastewater treatment system at facilities that use AAOT as a raw material but that it may be preferentially partitioning to the sludge. In addition to the high risks calculated by the three reactants, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, the hydrolysis products of these compounds, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, also were detected in the waste at concentrations that pose significant risk ( i.e. , risks ranging from 1E&hyph;4 to 4E&hyph;6). Discussions addressing hydrolysis pathways and conditions for these compounds, and the issue of coeluting compounds associated with the hydrolysis products, were presented earlier in this preamble (see discussion of K162, and Section II.D). In addition to the primary raw materials and breakdown products presented above, the combined 2,4- and 2,6-isomers of dimethylaniline, which also are suspected raw material breakdown products, were detected in this waste at concentrations that pose a very high risk ( i.e. , a risk of 1E&hyph;4). Along with risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of wastewaters generated from the manufacture of azo pigments, all of the reactants and breakdown products previously discussed in this section ( i.e. , AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The reactants are used in producing numerous large-volume pigments that are manufactured on a frequent basis. Since this wastewater stream represents several commingled wastestreams from throughout the plant, the constituents are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined risks of these individual constituents, which are projected to be very high under the surface impoundment mismanagment scenario (i.e., 3E&hyph;4 at the high end), also were considered in making this listing determination. Based on the calculated risks associated with the plausible management practice for this waste (treatment in surface impoundments), EPA is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo pigments as a hazardous waste, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K163. However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment sludges from the production of azo pigments (K162) are listed as proposed, the available options for wastewater management may change and the surface impoundment scenario may not be plausible for the following reason: wastewaters that are managed in an impoundment will generate sludges through precipitation. In the event that K162 sludges were listed and the wastewaters were not, the sludges generated in a Subtitle D wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface impoundment would become subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. The Agency is requesting comment on whether the use of Subtitle D surface impoundments to manage wastewaters would be a plausible management scenario if the wastewaters were not listed but the wastewater treatment sludges were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is requesting comment on the need to list K163 wastewaters, given that the plausibility of the management scenario on which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the final outcome of the K162 sludge listing. For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for Listing: Aniline, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3-aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene, acetoacet- o -anisidide, acetoacet- o -toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline. In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 3-aminotoluene, acetoacet- o -anisidide, acetoacet- o -toluidide, acetoacetanilide, 2,4-dimethylaniline, and 2,6-dimethylaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous Constituents.", "qid": 350, "docid": "FR941222-1-00047", "score": 6.518199920654297}, {"content": "Title: Content: Additionally, the shifts in proportions of chemicals used in the formulation result in less waste than is normally generated through the traditional manufacturing process, resulting in a lower probability of overall adverse effects to the general population.

Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the section on acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning. (d) Other chlorinated solvents.

Although the Agency's risk screen focused on use of these chemicals in metals cleaning operations, the screen suggests that release profiles for these chemicals in electronics cleaning will be either the same or lower. As a result, the Agency has reached the same conclusion with respect to electronics cleaning as in the metals cleaning analysis, namely that any risks due to the inherent toxicity of these chemicals could be controlled by existing and future regulatory standards. (e) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in electronics cleaning. The Agency did not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace. (f) Volatile methyl siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the electronics cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these chemicals will be handled under a separate rule-making. (3) Precision cleaning. (a) Semi-aqueous/aqueous cleaners. Semi-aqueous and aqueous cleaners are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The reasons for this decision are the same as those described in the metals cleaning section. Each of these alternatives has the potential to service approximately 65 percent of the precision cleaning market. This figure may overestimate the technical potential for water-based cleaners in this sector, since this end use sector faces the greatest technical constraints in implementing new cleaning alternatives. The Agency did not specifically examine risks from water-based formulations used in precision cleaning since the processes are typically either similar to those used in metals cleaning or have lower throughputs and therefore fewer discharges. Therefore, the analysis assumed that these risks from precision cleaning would be either comparable to or less than risks associated with use of water-based formulations for metals cleaning. (b) Other chlorinated solvents. Other chlorinated solvents are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The reasons for this decision are described in the section on metals cleaning. For the analysis of risks from these substitutes in the precision cleaning end use sector, the Agency made the same assumptions as in its analysis for electronics cleaning applications of water-based formulations, namely that exposures would be equal to or less than exposures in the metals cleaning sector since the processes for precision cleaning are similar or even of lower emissions than those for metals cleaning. Consequently, the Agency believes that risks would also be either equivalent or lower. (c) Straight organic solvent cleaning. Straight organic solvent cleaning is an acceptable substitute for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. This acceptability determination extends to organic solvents used as individual chemicals as well as in combinations. The Agency's justification for this decision is described in the section on acceptable substitutes for metals cleaning. (d) Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning. Supercritical fluid cleaning, plasma cleaning, UV-ozone cleaning are all acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in precision cleaning. The Agency did not identify any environmental issues associated with use of these substitutes. While ozone is hazardous to human health, OSHA has already set standards for use of this compound in the workplace. (e) Volatile Methyl Siloxanes (dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, decamethyltetrasiloxane). The volatile methyl siloxanes dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, and decamethyltetrasiloxane are acceptable substitutes for CFC&hyph;113 and MCF in the precision cleaning sector. The Agency's risk screen for these chemicals indicated that exposure to these substitutes are generally below levels that would raise concern for health risks. Two of the volatile methyl siloxanes, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane, have low company-set exposure limits, and these chemicals will be handled under a separate rule-making. b. Substitutes acceptable subject to use conditions.

ACTION : Proposed rule; Notice of informal public hearings. SUMMARY : The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposes to revise its Safety and Health Regulations for Longshoring and, to a far lesser extent, to amend its Safety and Health Regulations for Marine Terminals. The proposed rule covers cargo handling and related activities conducted aboard vessels and at Marine Terminals. The proposed amendments to the Marine Terminals standard are intended primarily to provide regulatory consistency with the proposed Longshoring ship-board rules. The proposed rules would be ``vertical'' standards which apply to longshoring and marine terminal activities only, except for those general industry provisions referenced within this proposed rule. This proposal contains requirements for longshoring and marine terminal operations; the testing and certification of specific types of cargo lifting appliances and associated auxiliary gear; other cargo handling equipment such as conveyors and industrial trucks; access to vessels; working surfaces; and personal protective equipment. Additionally, specialized longshoring operations such as containerized cargo, roll-on roll-off (Ro-Ro) and menhaden are specifically addressed. The principal hazards addressed by this proposal are injuries and accidents associated with cargo lifting gear, vehicular cargo transferral, manual cargo handling, hazardous atmospheres and materials, and finally, those hazards posed by the more modern and sophisticated cargo handling methods brought about by intermodalism. This provides notice of OSHA's intent to schedule informal public hearings on OSHA's proposed rulemaking on Longshoring and the related Marine Terminal provisions. DATES: Written comments on the standard must be postmarked on or before September 23, 1994. Notices of intention to appear at the informal public hearings must be postmarked by August 24, 1994.Written comments, testimony, and all evidence which will be offered into the hearing record must be postmarked by 21 days prior to the date of the hearing to be attended. The hearings will begin at 9:30 a.m. and be held in the following cities, beginning on the following dates: Charleston, South Carolina on September 20, 1994; Seattle, Washington on October 19, 1994; and New Orleans, Louisiana on November 15, 1994. Requests for public hearings in locations other than the above must be received by July 11, 1994. Parties who request more than 10 minutes for their presentation at the informal public hearing and parties who will submit documentary evidence at the hearing must submit the full text of their testimony and all documentary evidence, postmarked on or before 21 days prior the date of the hearing to be attended.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION I. Background As a result of the high number and serious nature of accidents occurring to port workers in the United States, Congress, in 1958, amended the Longshore and Harborworker's Compensation Act (LHWCA) (33 U.S.C. 901 et seq. ) to provide a large segment of port based employees with a safer work environment. The amendments (P.L. 85&hyph;742, 72 Stat. 835) significantly strengthened Section 41 of the LHWCA (33 U.S.C. 941) by requiring employers covered by that Act to ``furnish, maintain and use'' equipment, and to establish safe working conditions in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. Two years later, the Labor Standards Bureau (LSB) of the Department of Labor issued the first set of safety and health regulations for longshoring activities as 29 CFR part 9 (25 FR 1565). These standards were amended on several occasions between 1960 and 1971. Since 1971, there have been no substantive changes to these provisions. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act) (29 U.S.C. 650 et seq .), which established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), directed the Secretary of Labor to adopt, under the authority conferred by section 6(a) of the Act, ``Any established Federal standard'' as an OSHA standard during the first 2 years of the Act. The Longshoring standards, then codified as 29 CFR part 1504, were adopted by OSHA under section 6(a) in 1971, and were recodified as 29 CFR part 1918. The longshoring industry has changed dramatically since 1971. The methods of cargo handling and the equipment associated with those methods have undergone significant modification. Vessels designed specifically for the carriage of intermodal containers, vehicular rolling stock, and even barges, are now the most common types of ships calling at U.S. ports. By contrast, the established Longshoring standard was designed largely for activities being conducted using methods and equipment that have been overshadowed or replaced by more modern methods of cargo handling. The proposal being published today will seek to modernize OSHA's regulatory approach to deal with these changes in the industry. It is important to consider, however, that some of the older, more conventional vessel configurations, equipped with features and aspects that are addressed in the current standard, continue to call at U.S. ports. For that reason, the Agency will retain in this proposal a number of provisions whose utility, although diminished, will continue to be necessary. Nevertheless, the Agency requests the public to comment on certain provisions that it considers obsolete and no longer in use. For example, the Agency is considering deleting the provisions that address the manually lowering or topping of booms based on a determination that these operations are no longer performed as a part of longshoring work. On July 5, 1983, OSHA published its final rule for Marine Terminals (48 FR 30886)(Ex. 1&hyph;101). These rules were designed to address the shoreside segment of marine cargo handling. Since the Marine Terminal standards currently address equipment and situations (i.e., powered industrial trucks; conveyors; passage between levels and across openings; etc.) that have shipboard counterparts, appropriate provisions from those standards are incorporated into this proposal for shipboard cargo handling, as well. Accordingly, the Agency will rely upon background material and data used to substantiate OSHA's rule for Marine Terminals, and incorporates the docket (S&hyph;506) developed in that rulemaking. This proposal seeks to provide a practical continuity as it addresses the more conventional and time proven methods of cargo handling along with those more modern and revolutionary. The Agency welcomes all suggestions on how to better meet this goal. Longshoring Hazards Traditionally, the longshore industry has been notable in terms of its accident experience. The work environment found in the marine cargo handling sector exposes workers to a greater risk of injury than is true for most other industries. In fact, in the last calendar year for which industrial illnesses and accidents are fully tabulated, this industrial sector had one of the highest rate of lost workdays in the nation. The following tables found in BLS reports (Exs. 1&hyph;109, 1&hyph;110, 1&hyph;111, 1&hyph;112, and 1&hyph;113) are useful in making a comparative assessment: Table A 1Total of lost workdays (rate per 100 full time employees) 11985 11986 11987 11988 11989 11990 11991 Private sector 64.9 65.8 69.9 76.1 78.7 84.0 86.5 Construction 129 134 136 142 143 148 148 SIC 446 (449) 350 405 422 436 343 284 329 Note: These 1988 to 1991 figures are based on SIC Code 449, which includes water transportation. It should be noted that the SIC Code for water transportation was changed from 446 to 499 in 1987. Table B 1Total cases (rate per 100 full-time employees) 11985 11986 11987 11988 11989 11990 11991 Private sector 7.9 7.9 8.3 8.6 8.6 8.8 8.4 Construction Trades 15.2 15.2 14.7 14.6 14.3 14.2 13.0 SIC 446 (449) 16.3 18.0 17.0 14.5 14.7 13.5 13.9 Note: These 1988 to 1991 figures are based on SIC Code 449, which includes water transportation. It should be noted that the SIC Code for water transportation was changed from 446 to 449 in 1987. In 1985, OSHA requested the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to initiate a survey that could be used to develop common aspects of accidents occurring within the current longshore sector (Ex. 1&hyph;73). This survey helped to point out that in spite of the increases in automation that have occurred in the industry, injuries and lost workday cases continue to remain high and the break bulk type of operation still accounts for a major portion of the injuries that occur aboard ship. OSHA sought to validate even further the conclusions it could draw, both from this survey and from regularly published BLS occupational safety and health statistics. In so doing, the Agency reviewed data published in Seafarer magazine (April 1987). In an article entitled ``WGMA reports safety statistics for 85&hyph;86 contract year'' (Ex. 1&hyph;14), that periodical listed a number of pertinent figures that serve to corroborate the other accident information OSHA has secured. The West Gulf Report, prepared by Mr. Hal Draper, Director of Safety; Health and Training for the West Gulf Maritime Association, addressed the accident experience of several ports from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Brownsville, Texas. Quoting directly from the article: West Gulf Report. Draper's report on West Gulf longshore accidents during the 1985&hyph;86 contract year covered a total of 1,192 incidents. According to his analysis, 70% of the accidents occurred on board ships; the remaining 30% on the dock or in the warehouse/terminal. Cargo was involved in 30% of the accidents, 64% of which involved sacks/bags, and 12% steel/pipe. Two hundred and forty of the incidents (20%) involved the individual being struck by a moving object; 221 (19%) resulted from lifting, pushing, pulling or bodily reaction; 208 (17%) from falls from the same level-slip or trip; 142 (12%) from striking against, or stepping/jumping on an object; 130 (11%) from being struck by a falling object; and 109 (9%) from being caught in, under, or between objects. Thirteen percent of all accidents involved stevedore gear/equipment. Another way the Agency attempted to identify the major sources of longshoring accidents for rulemaking purposes was to examine a number of fatal or near fatal accidents reported to OSHA from this industry sector during the period July 1972&hyph;March 1992. In conducting this analysis, OSHA examined these case files to determine the precise cause of the accident. A brief summary of a few of the more than 250 such accidents reviewed is provided below. Boston, Massachusetts _August 1974. A longshoreman, seriously injured while working in the hold of a bulk cargo vessel, was placed aboard a stokes basket stretcher to be transported ashore by the vessel's cargo hoisting gear. The stokes basket had no effective means to secure the injured worker to the stretcher. While in transit, the injured worker fell out of the litter, back into the hold (Ex. 1&hyph;90). Port Elizabeth, New Jersey _June 1978. One employee was killed and one seriously injured when an intermodal container lifting beam, being lowered to hoist the container both men were standing on, suddenly fell. The device, weighing in excess of 4 tons, crushed both employees. Compliance with proposed 1918.81(k) would have prevented this accident (Ex. 1&hyph;87). Port Newark, New Jersey _August 1976. An employee aboard an elevator Ro-Ro ship, while in the process of discharging automobiles, drove into what was thought to be an available elevator to gain access to the ramp or discharge deck. The elevator was actually at a higher deck. The employee and vehicle fell into the shaft and down three decks. Barricading of the open deck spaces could have prevented this accident (Ex. 1&hyph;88). San Juan, Puerto Rico _August 1978. An employee aboard a seagoing, multi-deck Ro-Ro barge was run over and killed by a tractor trailer while the trailer was being maneuvered into its stowage position. No signalman was provided to protect employees from the hazard that ultimately killed this lasher (an employee engaged in securing cargo). Additionally, illumination was severely lacking within the confines of the vessel's below deck cargo spaces. The use of proper illumination and a signaller for this operation could have prevented the fatality (Ex. 1&hyph;89). Port Elizabeth, New Jersey _August 1984. Two workers, while driving in a vehicle within a large Ro-Ro vessel, fell from the end of an elevated internal ramp back down to deck level. These employees thought the ramp could take them to the next higher deck, however, the ramp was not so positioned. The car they were operating landed on its roof. One employee was killed, the other was injured. Barricading of the ramp could have prevented this accident (Ex. 1&hyph;86). Houston, Texas _July 1987. Two longshoremen were killed while positioned atop a deck stowed intermodal container. As they were performing their work, an empty forty foot container being passed over their heads became disengaged from the lifting gear and fell on them. These fatalities could have been prevented if the employees had stayed clear of the overhead drafts (Ex. 1&hyph;74). Port of Los Angeles, California _March, 1992. One longshoreman was killed while working on top of a stack of containers on the deck of a container vessel. A container top safety device was available, but the longshoreman was not attached to it. The safety device, which was attached to the container crane spreader bar, moved and became hung up. When it released, it catapulted the longshoreman off of the stack of containers and onto the dock. This incident could have been prevented if the employee had not been working on the top of the container, or had been using fall protection if it were necessary to be working there (Ex. 1&hyph;108). Based on the BLS data, the West Gulf Maritime Association's accident analysis, and OSHA's own analysis of fatal or near fatal accidents in the cargo handling industry , OSHA concludes that regulatory action is necessary in order to meet its mandate under the Act. See Section III, Statutory Considerations, below, for a complete discussion of OSHA's ``significant risk'' findings. II. General Format of the Standard A. Vertical vs. Horizontal Standards This proposed Longshoring standard has been drafted in a manner that will allow it to stand by itself, i.e., to be a ``vertical'' standard. Vertical standards are those that apply specifically to a given industry, in lieu of any other OSHA standard. In several areas of coverage specified in the proposal's scope section, OSHA's General Industry standards are incorporated by reference. This approach follows OSHA's other marine cargo handling standard, Marine Terminals, 29 CFR part 1917 (48 FR 30886). Vertical standards can encourage voluntary compliance because they are directed to the particular problems of the industry, and because they only contain provisions that are appropriate to the industry in question. On the other hand, since many industries covered by OSHA do in fact use the same or similar equipment and processes, and therefore have employees who are exposed to the same hazards, it is usually a more efficient use of the Agency's resources to develop ``horizontal'' standards (those applying across industry lines). It is also more efficient to train field personnel in general safety programs tailored to the horizontal General Industry standards than to train field staff in individual programs designed for specific industries. In 1983, OSHA promulgated a vertical standard for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (48 FR 30886)_OSHA's rules for Marine Terminals. As was the case in that rulemaking, the Agency is proposing the inclusion of a list of applicable General Industry standards which will supplement the specific provisions in part 1918. This provides coverage for hazards for which the marine cargo handling industry is neither unique nor different from other industries. As an example, OSHA proposes to adopt by reference 1910.95, titled ``occupational noise exposure.'' The detrimental effects of prolonged high levels of noise is the same whether the exposure takes place aboard a vessel or in a factory. The exposure may not be as constant or the workforce may not be subjected to the same type of noise day after day, however the potential for overexposure is there. OSHA does not feel it is necessary to write a ``vertical'' standard that covers exposure to noise when the General Industry standard will suffice. This is entirely consistent with the current coverage provided by OSHA rules for Marine Terminals (part 1917). The majority of this proposed Longshore standard is a ``vertical'' standard. The work environment aboard ship is unique in many respects. Longshore workers must continually work in the harsh environment of the waterfront, which requires exposure both to work-related hazards, such as falling cargo, and to environmental hazards, such as drowning and working around machinery in bad weather. Longshore workers perform some of the same high-hazard tasks, and confront many of the same heavy-industry hazards, as those typically associated with the construction industry. Examples of such hazards include falls, and crushing and caught-in injuries. Cargo handling and construction work are also both weather-dependent and have a high proportion of part-time and transient employees. The extremely high occupational injury and illness incidence rates for the marine cargo handling industry, mentioned in the previous section, testify to the hazardous nature of the longshoring industry. OSHA has decided to continue a vertical standard for many aspects of this high-hazard industry, supplemented by general industry standards where necessary and appropriate. The Agency believes that this approach is necessary to adequately address the unique hazards and working conditions of this industry. OSHA also has a vertical standard for the construction industry (29 CFR part 1926), another hazardous industry with a large workforce. OSHA solicits comments both as to the merits and the limitations of a vertical standard for longshoring operations. B. Performance vs. Specification The format and substance of this standard reflect OSHA's effort to eliminate unnecessary regulations and to simplify and update others. To achieve these goals, the Agency has adopted a performance approach to writing new rules and revising existing ones. A performance-based standard identifies a hazard and the level of control required to protect against the hazard, without specifying the precise means of achieving such control, while a specification standard stipulates design and construction criteria to be met to achieve a particular safety objective. The lack of flexibility in many specification standards fails to take into account the adequacy of many existing operations and work practices and discourages innovation. In keeping with OSHA's commitment to clarity, flexibility, and in order to encourage employers to comply with the standards, this longshore industry proposal has adopted the performance approach except in those cases in which employee safety would be enhanced by more specific requirements. The Agency is interested in receiving comments from persons who feel that certain of the proposed provisions would benefit from a greater degree of specification or from a more goal-oriented approach. III. Statutory Considerations A. Introduction. Throughout this proposal, OSHA describes the hazards confronted by employees who are engaged in longshoring activities and the measures required to protect affected employees from those hazards. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to explain the legal basis for its determination that the Longshoring standard, as proposed, is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death. Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory occupational safety and health standards applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``each employer shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 652(8)) provides that: . . . the term `occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment. In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective safety standards. In International Union, UAW v. OSHA , 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In National Grain & Feed Association v. OSHA , 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective, directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing courts must defer. (See for example, Building & Constr. Trades Dept . AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); Industrial Union Dept. AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst. , 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the Agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought from OSHA more clarification on the agency's view of the scope of those parameters. In light of those decisions, OSHA believes it would be useful to include in the preamble to this proposed safety standard a statement of its view of the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and to explain why it is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this rule. Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally, proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing a rule within their parameters. B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared ``it to be its purpose and policy ... to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe ... working conditions [29 U.S.C. 651(b)].'' To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing Federal and consensus standards during the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C. 655(a)].'' Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(3)], based on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe ... employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C. 654(a)].'' ``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business.... Indeed, Congress thought that the financial costs of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the financial costs of eliminating these problems [ American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc. v. Donovan , 452 U.S. 490, 519&hyph;522 (1981) (ATMI); emphasis was supplied in original].'' ``[T]he fundamental objective of the Act [is] to prevent occupational deaths and serious injuries [ Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall , 445 U.S. 1, 11 (1980)].'' ``We know the costs would be put into consumer goods but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America [S. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970); H.R. Rep. No. 91&hyph;1291, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), reprinted in Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, (Committee Print 1971) (`Leg. Hist.') at 444 (Senator Yarborough)].'' ``Of course, it will cost a little more per item to produce a washing machine. Those of us who use washing machines will pay for the increased cost, but it is worth it, to stop the terrible death and injury rate in this country [ Id . at 324; see also 510&hyph;511, 517].'' [T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives and useful years of labor. When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease, over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation and medical expenses....Only through a comprehensive approach can we hope to effect a significant reduction in these job death and casualty figures. [Id. at 518&hyph;19 (Senator Cranston)] Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers_particularly smaller ones_simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively, unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets a threshold and a ceiling for safety rulemaking that provide clear and reasonable parameters for agency action. OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``any permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe_in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [ Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst , 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (Benzene); emphasis was supplied in original].'' When, as frequently happens in safety rulemaking, OSHA promulgates standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, it must explain ``why the rule as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C. 655(b)(8)].'' Thus, national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C. 655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would a fortiori not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See Industrial Union Dept., v. Hodgson , [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their employers out of business.') [American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc., 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,' but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of, the industry')].'' By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in ATMI that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably below this level. (See for example, ATMI , 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 \u03bcg/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of 90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 \u03bcg/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 \u03bcg/m3 was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); American Iron & Steel Institute, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small firms.) Although the cotton dust and lead rulemakings involved health standards, the economic feasibility ceiling established therein applies equally to safety standards. Indeed, because feasibility is a necessary element of a ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' standard, this ceiling boundary is the same for health and safety rulemaking since it comes from section 3(8), which governs all permanent OSHA standards. All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (ATMI, at 514 n. 32; Building and Const. Trades Dept., AFL-CIO v. Brock , 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall , 647 F.2d 1189, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied , 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). To reach the necessary findings and conclusions that a safety standard substantially reduces a significant risk of harm, is both technologically and economically feasible, and is cost effective, OSHA must conduct rulemaking in accord with the requirements of section 6 of the OSH Act. The regulatory proceeding allows it to determine the qualitative and, if possible, the quantitative nature of the risk with and without regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance, the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See ATMI at 2501&hyph;2503; American Iron & Steel Institute generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See Steelworkers , 647 F.2d at 1206&hyph;1207.) OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety standards (29 U.S.C. 659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in Benzene at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors. (See Building and Construction Trades Dept., AFL-CIO v. Brock , 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) OSHA safety rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these parameters, further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful comment militate against regulatory extremes. D. The proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards comply with the statutory criteria described above and are not subject to the additional constraints applicable to section 6(b)(5) standards. Standards that regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards. (See National Grain & Feed Assn., v. OSHA (NGFA II) , 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that all OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the proposed revisions of the Longshore and Marine Terminal standards are safety standards, because these standards address hazards, such as falling, falling objects and crushing, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards subject to section 6(b)(5). The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: ... by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational safety. The legislative history makes this distinction even clearer: [The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [Leg. Hist. at 502&hyph;503 (Sen. Dominick), quoted in Benzene at 648&hyph;49]. Additionally, Representative Daniels distinguished between ``insidious `silent killers' such as toxic fumes, bases, acids, and chemicals'' and ``violent physical injury causing immediate visible physical harm'' (Leg. Hist. at 1003), and Representative Udall contrasted insidious hazards like carcinogens with ``the more visible and well-known question of industrial accidents and on-the-job injury'' (Leg. Hist. at 1004). (See also, for example, S.Rep. No. 1282, 91st Cong., 2d Sess 2&hyph;3 (1970), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1970, pp. 5177, 5179, reprinted in Leg. Hist. at 142&hyph;43, discussing 1967 Surgeon General study that found that 65 percent of employees in industrial plants ``were potentially exposed to harmful physical agents, such as severe noise or vibration , or to toxic materials''; Leg.Hist at 412; id. at 446; id. at 516; id. at 845; International Union, UAW at 1315.) In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (Benzene at 643 n. 48). As Justice Stevens observed: The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances ... was because Congress recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case, the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [Benzene, at 649 n. 54.] Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example, the Court in International Union, UAW v. OSHA , 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between 'health' and 'safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported the OSHA position (International Union, UAW at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (International Union, UAW at 1313, citing Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984)). The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust ( National Grain & Feed Association v. OSHA (NGFA II), 866 F.2d 717, 733 (5th Cir. 1989)). It therefore applied the criteria of section 3(8), requiring the Agency to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect section 3(8), requiring the Agency to establish that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety. As explained in Section I, Background, above, and Section V, Summary and Explanation of the Proposal and in Section VIII, Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, below, OSHA has determined that marine cargo handling activities pose significant risks to employees (18 fatalities and 7,593 injuries annually) and that the provisions of the proposed rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks. The Agency estimates that compliance with the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards will cost $4.7 million the first year and $1.8 million annually thereafter and will reduce the risk of the identified hazards (preventing 3 fatalities and 1,262 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial reduction of significant risk of material harm for the population at risk of approximately 93,000 employees. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because all of the provisions of the proposed standard can be met by using currently available equipment, facilities, supplies, and work practices. Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs during the standard's first five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs thereafter. As detailed in Section VIII, Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Table 1, below, the standard's costs, benefits, and compliance requirements are consistent with those of other OSHA safety standards, such as the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) standard. &blank; 1Standard (CFR cite) 1Final rule date (FR cite) 1Number of deaths prevented annually 1Number of injuries prevented annually 1Annual cost first five yrs (mill) 1Annual cost next five yrs (mill) Grain handling (1910.272) l12&hyph;31&hyph;87 (52 FR 49622) 18 394 5.9 to 33.4 5.9 to 33.4 HAZWOPER (1910.120) l3&hyph;6&hyph;89 (54 FR 9311) 32 18,700 153 153 Excavations (Subpt P) l10&hyph;31&hyph;89 (54 FR 45,954) 74 800 306 306 Process Safety Mgmt (1910.119) l2&hyph;24&hyph;92 57 FR 6356 330 1,917 880.7 470.8 Permit-Required Confined Spaces (1910.146) l1&hyph;14&hyph;93 58 FR 4462 54 5,041 202.4 202.4 OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to marine cargo handling hazards. The Agency acknowledges that some industries covered by the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards have more documented marine cargo handling injuries or fatalities than do others. OSHA does not believe that the risk associated with exposure to marine cargo handling related hazards varies according to the number of incidents documented for a particular SIC code. OSHA has set the scope of the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards to address those situations where employees are exposed to marine cargo handling hazards, regardless of the relative frequency of incidents. The Agency believes, based on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that employees in the covered sectors face significant risks marine cargo handling activities. Therefore, the Agency has determined that all employees within the scope of the proposed standard face a significant risk of material harm and that compliance with the proposed revisions of the Longshoring and Marine Terminal standards is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from that risk. IV. Review of General Industry Standards for Longshoring Operations Applicability Of all the work environments OSHA regulates, the shipboard workplace ranks high among those that do not track easily with many of the regulations that comprise 29 CFR part 1910 (General Industry standards). For instance, subjects such as scaffolding; powered platforms; power presses; wood working machinery; abrasive wheels; forging machines; pulp and paper mills; bakery equipment; laundry machinery; sawmills; logging; telecommunications; and spray painting, all of which receive comprehensive discussion within the text of part 1910, are virtually non-existent concerns in shipboard longshoring operations. Essentially longshoring is a transport industry and, as such, is free from many of the hazards found in general industry. Accordingly, these provisions are not included in this proposed rule. In some areas where there is current coverage in part 1918, there is similar coverage in part 1910. OSHA's primary concern is to make sure that the 1910 provisions needed to supplement the 1918 coverage are included in the proposal. For instance, subjects such as ladders; slings; conveyors; industrial trucks; cranes and personal protective equipment, which are fully addressed within part 1910, are presently addressed with a specific regard for the maritime workplace, within OSHA's current Longshoring rules. This proposal seeks to update and revise the existing part 1918 and in some instances has relied in substantial measure upon part 1910 language. In other instances, such as when addressing container and roll on/roll off operations, entirely new concepts have been developed to take account of the sometimes unique operational aspects of the modern stevedoring community. Where the hazards present in shipside cargo handling are directly parallel to those encountered in the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling, such as in sanitation considerations, OSHA is proposing that the language of provisions designed to address such shoreside hazards be the same as in the Marine Terminal standards in 29 CFR part 1917. Interested parties are requested to submit any information related to the coverage of this proposed revision of the Longshoring rules. For example, are specific hazards adequately addressed in this proposal? Are longshore worker exposed to safety and health hazards which this proposal does not adequately address? Have unnecessary provisions been included in the proposal? Are there any areas of general industry coverage that have not been included in the proposal that should be? OSHA would particularly appreciate information on these issues. V. Summary and Explanation of the Proposal Subpart A_Scope and Definitions Section 1918.1 Scope and applicability . Proposed 1918.1 describes the scope and applicability of the Longshoring standard. The Longshoring rules apply from the foot of the gangway up, to include all cargo handling related activities aboard a given vessel. It is important to remember, however, that in ship to shore/shore to ship cargo transfer operations using shore based material handling devices, all lifting device specific aspects of such transfers will be covered by the part 1917 rules. When cargo transfer is accomplished using ship's cargo gear, the part 1918 rules shall apply. In keeping with the concept outlined in the foregoing section of this preamble (II. General Format of the Standard), certain selected provisions currently found in OSHA's part 1910 standards have been identified to have application to shipboard longshoring operations. Sections 1918.1(b)(1) through (4), (b)(6) through (8), and (b)(10) through (12) provide coverage for hazards for which the marine cargo handling industry is neither unique nor different from other industries. These hazards are not otherwise addressed by existing maritime standards. The hazards addressed by 1918.1(b)(5) (Tools) and (b)(9) (Machine Guarding), on the other hand, are addressed by existing maritime standards but do not receive the comprehensive treatment afforded by part 1910, subpart P, (Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment) and subpart O, (Machinery and Machine Guarding). OSHA is proposing to delete the current requirements for hand tools, 1918.72, titled Tools, and replace it with Subpart P of 29 CFR part 1910, titled Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment. OSHA believes that the general Industry Subpart P regulations are more comprehensive and afford better protection. OSHA proposes to do the same in the Marine Terminal regulations by replacing the paragraphs under the sections heading Hand tools, 1917.51 and replacing them with 29 CFR 1910 subpart P. For the same reasons, OSHA is also proposing to remove the requirements under 1917.151 titled Machine guarding, and replace them with Subpart O of the General Industry standards, part 1910, titled Machinery and Machine Guarding. OSHA is also proposing to include Subpart O, Machinery and machine guarding, to the Scope and Applicability section of part 1918. OSHA promulgated the hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) standard on March 6, 1989 (54 FR 9294). OSHA'S decision to cover all emergency response was based upon the high risk associated with emergency response by untrained and unprotected employees and the need for proper training and equipment to be provided for emergency response to hazardous substance releases. This standard currently applies in its entirety to shipboard longshoring operations. HAZWOPER divides emergency response into three separate areas: (1) Response at uncontrolled hazardous waste sites (1910.120(l)); (2) response at Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, facilities (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) 1910.120(p)(8); and (3) response to emergency hazardous substance releases not covered by the previously noted paragraphs 1910.120(q). Since the activities described in the first two areas of the HAZWOPER standard do not represent marine cargo handling activities within the scope of part 1917 or part 1918, OSHA is proposing to only apply 1910.120(q) to longshore (part 1918) and marine terminal operations (part 1917). Paragraph (q) covers employees engaged in toxic substance emergency response no matter where it occurs. This paragraph, essentially, requires employers to develop and implement an emergency response plan to handle anticipated toxic substance emergencies prior to the commencement of emergency response operations. If employers decide to evacuate their employees from the danger area when an emergency occurs and do not permit their employees to assist in handling the emergency, they are exempt from the requirements of this paragraph if they provide an emergency action plan and meet other requirements in accordance with 1910.38(a) which states: The emergency action plan shall be in writing *&blank;*&blank;* and shall cover those designated actions employers and employees must take to ensure employee safety from fire and other emergencies. Simply stated, if an employer decides ``not to fight a fire'' (i.e., not to respond to an emergency), then 1910.120(q) does not apply but 1910.38(a) does. OSHA is proposing to delete the current requirements for hand tools, 1918.72, titled Tools, and replace it with subpart P of 29 CFR Part 1910, titled Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment. OSHA believes that the general Industry subpart P regulations are more comprehensive and afford better protection. OSHA proposes to do the same in the Marine Terminal regulations by replacing the paragraphs under the sections heading Hand tools, 1917.51 and replacing with 29 CFR part 1910 subpart P. For the same reasons, OSHA is also proposing to remove the requirements under 1917.51 titled Machine guarding, and replace them with subpart O of the General Industry Standards, part 1910, titled Machinery and Machine Guarding. Proposed 1918.2 carries over many of the definitions from the current Longshoring regulations. However, there are some new definitions or some modifications to existing definitions that reflect changes in current custom and practice in the Longshore industry. For example, the term ``designated person'', which is not used in the current longshore regulation, is used in this proposal. The term is used to identify a person who has a special skill in a particular area and has been so noted by the employer. Because of this skill, this employee is assigned to perform specific tasks in this area of expertise. While the concept of ``designated person'' is found throughout the current requirements, it is expressed in many different ways. This proposal tightens up the use of this concept by its consistent use of the term ``designated person'' throughout the standard. Some examples of the use of the term are: 1918.51(b) requires that a designated representative, in lieu of the employer, shall inspect vessel's cargo gear before use and at intervals during use; and 1918.55 (c)(7) where a designated person is one with knowledge in crane operations, specifically when using two or more cranes to hoist in unison, along with knowledge in rigging. In addition, the current references to the ``Federal maritime jurisdiction'' and ``navigable waters'' in the definitions of ``employee'' in paragraph (e) and ``employer'' in paragraph (f) are being dropped. The current rules were originally promulgated under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 941) for which the navigable waters was a jurisdictional prerequisite. With the promulgation of the OSH Act, which applies to private sector employment in workplaces in a covered jurisdiction, however, such a prerequisite was no longer necessary. Therefore, OSHA is proposing to update these rules by eliminating the reference to navigable waters in this definition. Additionally, several new or substantially revised definitions are found in paragraphs (d), (g), (h), (j), (k), and (n) of this section. The definitions for enclosed space and fumigant are added to this section for clarity since these terms are used in the standard. In addition, they are virtually identical, with the exception of the examples, to those found in the Marine Terminal standards. The term ``hazardous cargo'' has been expanded to reflect the Marine Terminal's definition of ``hazardous cargo, materials, substance or atmosphere.'' This definition goes beyond the current part 1918 definition by including references to subpart Z as well as oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Additionally, it is, in turn, consistent with the Hazardous Communication standard found at 29 CFR 1910.1200. Another new definition is integral to the major impetus for revising part 1918, as discussed above: ``intermodal container.'' The definition for ``intermodal container'' reflects both the definition found in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Code of Practice for Safety and Health in Dock Work, (Ex. 1&hyph;135) and the definition found in International Standards Organization (ISO) Standard 830, Freight Containers-Terminology, (Ex. 1&hyph;134). This definition is also being proposed to replace the current definition for ``intermodal container'' found in the Marine Terminal standard, 1917.2(u). The definitions of ``dockboards'' and ``ramps'', currently found in the Marine Terminal standard, are being proposed for Longshoring, as well, with minor modification. Certain definitions currently in part 1918 would be deleted. Existing definitions referring to the existing 1918.13, certification of shore-based material handling devices were deleted because they were superseded by the Marine Terminal standard. The existing definition of the term ``shall'' is being deleted as unnecessary. Subpart B_Gear Certification A. Section 1918.11 Gear certification . Since 1960, safety and health regulations designed to protect U.S. dockworkers (with particular regard to vessel's cargo handling gear) have relied upon the documentary proofs of tests and examinations mandated by International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 32 (Ex. 1&hyph;34). In Article 9 of that Convention, units and articles comprising ship's cargo handling gear are enumerated and assigned an annual/quadrennial schedule of tests/examinations that must be attended and attested to by individuals judged to be ``competent'' by the national authorities of the vessel's registry. Although not a signatory to that Convention, the United States has conformed to this Convention via regulation promulgated by: (1) the U.S. Coast Guard, with regard to inspected U.S. flag vessels; and (2) OSHA, with regard to foreign flag vessels (1918.12). The Coast Guard has promulgated cargo gear regulations that exceed those found in Convention 32, namely 46 CFR part 91, that promote safe and unencumbered operations for U.S. flag vessels trading at foreign ports. On foreign flag vessels trading at U.S. ports, however, OSHA has sole responsibility for regulating and enforcing rules that address the cargo gear U.S. longshore workers utilize. Under Convention 32, proof load testing 1 was only required initially before being taken into service. Thereafter, components such as derricks, goosenecks, mast bands, derrick bands and any other difficult to disassemble fixed gear, were to be ``thoroughly examined'' every four years and ``inspected'' every 12 months. Other hoisting machinery, such as cranes, winches, blocks, shackles, and any other accessory gear, were to be ``thoroughly examined'' every 12 months. 1Proof load testing, as used here, means lifting an known weight that is in excess of the safe working load (SWL) of the lifting appliance being tested. Under Convention 32, the vessel's cargo handling gear was proof load tested initially, and then perhaps never again. After that initial test, such gear received various degrees of visual scrutiny, complemented on some occasions by non-destructive testing, i.e., a hammer test. Convention 152, adopted June 25, 1979, requires that such proof load testing is to occur at least every five years, and applies to all ship's lifting appliances. Within Article 3 of the new Convention, the term ``lifting appliance'' is defined as follows: Lifting appliance covers all stationary or mobile cargo-handling appliances, including shore-based power-operated ramps, used on shore or on board ship for suspending, raising or lowering loads or moving from one position to another while suspended or supported. (Ex. 1&hyph;5, pg.2) Thus, the extent of cargo handling equipment found aboard ship requiring testing and certification, heretofore restricted to specific assemblies and components (i.e., derricks, cranes, winches, etc.) is being expanded in this proposal to include all ``lifting appliances'' under the terms of the newer ILO Convention. This would include forklifts and other powered industrial equipment used to handle cargo that might be carried by a Ro-Ro vessel; and elevators found on Ro-Ro vessels used to move cargo from one deck level to another_in addition to vessel cranes and derricks. Under this proposal in 1918.11, all this equipment would be required to be tested and thoroughly examined initially before being put into use; retested and thoroughly examined every five years; and thoroughly examined every 12 months. In those situations where one container is used to lift another container, using twist locks, then the upper container and twist locks become, in effect, a lifting appliance and must be certified as such. International Aspects As is the case with all Federal agencies whose regulations impact international trade, OSHA has developed this proposal in light of international considerations. Through both law and policy, the United States has decided that standards-related activities shall not unnecessarily be a barrier to trade. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq ). addresses technical barriers to trade with regard to federal regulation. This Act states in Title 19 of the U.S. Code as follows: 2532. Federal standards-related activities No Federal Agency may engage any standards related activity that creates unnecessary obstacles to the foreign commerce of the United States, * * *. (1) Nondiscriminatory treatment. * * * * * * * * * * (2) Use of international standards._ (A) In general. * * * each Federal agency, in developing standards, shall take into consideration International standards and shall, if appropriate, base the standards on International standards. Additionally, and consonant with this country's position on barriers to international trade, the United States is a signatory to the Multilateral Convention on the Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (1965) (Ex. 1&hyph;3). As a contracting government, the United States has agreed to: *&blank;*&blank;* Undertake to cooperate in securing the highest practicable degree of uniformity in formalities, documentary requirements and procedures in all matters in which such uniformity will facilitate and improve international maritime traffic and keep to a minimum any alterations informalities, documentary requirements and procedures necessary to meet special requirements of a domestic nature. (Article 3) Mindful of these international aspects, OSHA sought to formulate an acceptable approach to the vessel's cargo handling gear issue, and to other issues. The Agency requested the Department of State (Ex. 1&hyph;7) to present OSHA's tentative approach to all foreign nations whose flags may enter U.S. ports. This exercise was conducted in hope of ascertaining global acceptance. Reports back from responding foreign nations (Ex. 1&hyph;6) indicated overwhelming support for the Agency's approach to these issues, and OSHA has incorporated it in this proposal. Most nations, although stipulating that they had not as yet ratified the more recent ILO Convention, indicated that national laws recently ratified or those currently in the legislative process were at least as strong, and in some cases more stringent, than Convention 152. In consideration of this widespread international acceptance of ILO Convention 152's approach to testing and certification of cargo gear, OSHA has decided to propose it in this revision of the Longshoring standards. The Agency is interested in any additional comment on this issue that interested parties may be in a position to offer. Subpart C_Means of Access Section 1918.21 Gangways and other means of access . This proposed section joins together two similar sections (1918.11_Gangways and 1918.21_Gangways and Other Means of Access) of OSHA's current Longshoring rules. Clarity is improved in that rules addressing the same specific issue will no longer be situated in two different subparts of part 1918. As is the case in the current rules, gangway dimensions and characteristics are set out in proposed paragraph (a) to provide the safe access to vessels necessary for longshore workers. By using a blend of specification with performance based alternatives, the proposal lends the flexibility needed in accommodating foreign vessels. Language has been added that allows the use of materials that have been developed since the current rule was written, as long as the material has a strength equivalent to those that are listed. Proposed paragraph (b) carries over language from the current rules, as well as the term ``trimmed'' found in the Joint Maritime Safety Code of the New York Shipping Association/ International Longshoremen's Association (NYSA/ILA Safety Code) (Ex. 1&hyph;2) part M, paragraph 1), and requires that despite changing conditions brought about by tides, cargo operations, etc., the gangway and its components must be wholly serviceable. Proposed paragraphs (c) through (k) are similar to the language found in the current rules. Some paragraphs have been modified to address some problems associated with the current language. Paragraph (d) has been modified to require a safety net or suitable protection when the gangway overhangs the water in such a manner that there is a danger of employees falling between the ship and the dock. The net is required to prevent an employee from falling to a lower level. This is consistent with ILO'S ``Safety and Health in Dock Work,'' (Ex. 1&hyph;138). A new paragraph (i) has been added to address the hazard associated with slippery handrails and walking surfaces on gangways. Paragraph (j) references 1918.92 for illumination requirements on a gangway. In summary, these paragraphs address the requirement for a safe passage from the dock to the deck. Proposed paragraph (l) recognizes the U.S. Coast Guard's authority relating to jurisdictional matters aboard vessels having a current and valid certificate of inspection. Notwithstanding, for the purpose of this rule, if access is attained other than by the vessel's regular gangway, that access shall conform to the entirety of this section. Proposed 1918.22 carries over language from the current rules. Both paragraphs of this section contain the standard universal criteria for rope ladders, also known as ``Jacob's ladders'', namely, that such ladders be either double-runged or flat-treaded, so as to provide a more substantial tread surface; that they be well maintained and properly secured to available fittings; and that they not be permitted to hang from their lashing points with slack in them. It is often the case that such ladders are provided by the vessel when a more traditional means of access cannot be utilized. Notwithstanding, under these proposed rules the employer (who is often a contractor rendering a service to the vessel) must comply with this proposed section before employees are permitted to use these ladders. Proposed 1918.23 also carries over language from the current rules. Paragraph (a) sets out criteria for ramps used to gain vehicular access to or between barges. Of primary importance is that such ramps be of sufficient strength for the intended load. These ramps must be equipped with sideboards that will prevent vehicles from falling. They must also be well maintained and properly secured during use. Paragraph (b) addresses employee passage to and from certain floating craft. Under favorable conditions, it is sometimes possible to pass to and from such vessels without the aid of any device. In other than favorable conditions, however, this paragraph sets forth the criteria to provide safe passage. Of significant importance is the exception included at the end of the paragraph. That exception recognizes practical difficulties encountered on the Mississippi River system in providing traditional means of access on all occasions. When originally promulgated in 1960, the longshore rules (Ex. 1&hyph;39) took no cognizance of these special difficulties. In 1965, the Labor Standards Bureau published the following proposed clarification, (Ex. 1&hyph;40): In order to provide practical solutions in cases where current requirements cannot be met, because of local river and bank conditions (this section) should be amended by the addition of a provision. (p.7609) A provision to that effect was published in the Federal register in final form on May 21, 1966 (Ex. 1&hyph;41). Historically (Ex. 1&hyph;98), this exception has been based on tidal and current conditions on the Mississippi system (see definition at proposed 1918.2(s)). OSHA's experience has thus far concluded that such exceptional conditions prevail only on this inland system; however, the Agency solicits comments from interested individuals with other information on this issue. A sentence has been added to proposed 1924.23(c) that requires no more than two Jacob's ladders for any single barge, raft, or log boom being worked. This proposal is consistent with the requirements in 1918.25(a) which requires a maximum of two access ladders in a hatch. The term ``gang'' is used here and several other places in this proposal. It refers to a group of longshore persons that are assigned to a particular hold, deck, etc. on a ship for the purpose of loading or discharging cargo. A new paragraph (e) has been added to this section to address the problem associated with the lower rungs of a Jacob's ladder being crushed between the barge and another structure by requiring that a spacer or equivalent means be used to prevent it from occurring. If the lower rungs are crushed, this could cause an employee to fall between the barge and other structure. Another new paragraph (f) has been added to this section. This paragraph requires the a net or equivalent protection if there is a space between the vessel, barge or other structure when using a Jacob's ladder to prevent an employee from falling into the water. Proposed 1918.24 combines the current language of the existing longshore provisions for bridge plates and ramps with the terms that apply to similar shoreside equipment within 29 CFR part 1917 (Marine Terminals, 1917.124). In the adoption of such parallel rules, OSHA hopes to enhance the uniformity of regulation that is critical to safety performance both shipboard and shoreside. Throughout this proposal, the Agency has attempted to foster such uniformity and requests comments as to how this goal can be better achieved. Paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v) would be revised to require sideboards that are at least 6 inches (.16 m) high. This height is the same as found for bull rails that were in place at the time of the effective date of the Marine Terminal standard, found in 1917.112. OSHA believes that specifying the height of the sideboards will provide the necessary protection to prevent vehicles and equipment from accidently falling off the edge. OSHA requests comment from the public concerning appropriateness of the height of the sideboards. OSHA is also proposing to require the same 6 inch (.16 m) sideboards for dockboards and ramps that are in the Marine Terminal standard, 1917.124. Proposed 1918.25 combines the current requirements for portable ladders contained in the existing Longshoring rules with the similar rules of 1917.119. For fixed ladders, however, there is a distinction between the proposed and current Longshore standard which has to do with clearance in back of the ladder rungs. The existing requirement is 4 inches (.11 m), but the proposed clearance is 6 inches (.16 m), which reflects the current ILO Standard. Consistent with ILO's Guide to Safety and Health in Dock Work, (Ex. 1&hyph;129), OSHA is proposing that vessels built after December 5, 1981, (the date when ILO Convention 152, Occupational Safety and Health in Dock Work was put into effect), have a 6-inch (15 cm) clearance between the ladder and the surface to which it is fastened. Vessels built prior to December 5, 1981, however, may have a 4 inch (10 cm) clearance between the ladder and the surface to which it is fastened. OSHA encourages comment on this issue. (It should be noted where a fixed ladder has inadequate clearance, a suitable portable ladder could be used.) Generally, proposed 1918.25 includes much of the current language for ladders with some modifications. Provisions have been added that reference ANSI standards for manufactured portable ladders. There are also proposed provisions for ladder maintenance and usage that are similar to what is in the Marine Terminals standard, but are new to Longshoring. In paragraphs 1918.25(c) and (e) the phrase ``positively secured against shifting or slipping'' has been changed to ``positively secured or held against shifting or slipping while in use''. This change acknowledges that a worker(s) may hold a portable ladder in place while another worker is climbing the ladder in situations where the ladder cannot be secured and is consistent with the PMA-ILWU Safety Code, Rule 1506 (Ex. 1&hyph;145). In addition, for the purpose of clarifying paragraph (e), where the employer can demonstrate that employees can safely use the cargo itself to climb in and out of the hold (often referred to as ``safe cargo steps''), a straight ladder is not necessary. Paragraph (j)(8) on, ladder usage, acknowledges that while some ladders may not have slip-resistant bases, they can be readily secured by lashing them in place to prevent slipping or shifting when being used. Subpart D_Working surfaces OSHA clearly understands that many of the falling hazards addressed in part by this and other subparts, represent working environments and physical characteristics no longer observed with the type of frequency that was the case when the current Longshoring rules were last revised. Nonetheless, conventional cargo handling methods together with more traditional vessel designs are still encountered at U.S. ports. For this reason, OSHA proposes to retain current provisions that still have application. As an example, proposed 1918.31(c) prohibits employers from allowing work to be conducted on surfaces comprised of missing, broken or poorly fitting hatch covers. Currently, it is relatively rare to experience a vessel trading at U.S. ports, fitted with the type of removable hatch covers this provision addresses. Despite that rarity, such situations do arise. Proposed 1918.31(d) prohibits the placing of poorly fitting hatch covers and hatch beams that would constitute a work surface. As a practical matter, it is rare to see vessels at U.S. ports fitted out with hatch beams. In those instances, however, identifying marks are usually permanently fixed to such equipment. Those marks correspond to marks found on receptacle fittings on the vessel proper. In all cases, notwithstanding the presence of corresponding marks, the employer must make sure that all hatch beams and covers are seated securely, providing a strong and stable work surface. Proposed 1918.32(a) carries over language from the current Longshoring rule. Frequently cargo must be landed on temporary surfaces, generally presented by other cargo stows, prior to its ultimate place of rest. When this is so, it is important that employees have enough available space to work in safety upon such a surface, and that the temporary table is strong enough to safely support the loads being imposed. There are obviously many strength and size possibilities, which will be dictated by the size and weight of the drafts being landed. Proposed 1918.32(b) has been revised to address changes that have occurred in technology and work practices. Employees working on the tops of containers are now covered by 1918.85(j), Container top safety. (For a full discussion see the preamble to 1918.85(j) below). When employees working in cargo holds, are exposed to falls of more than 8 feet (2.4 m), the edge of the working surface must be guarded by a safety net, or must be otherwise rendered safe (such as by providing guardrails or fall arrest systems) to prevent employee injury. It should be noted that proposed 1918.32(b) does not include employees working on the top of intermodal containers in a hold as this is also covered under 1918.85(j). Of prime importance is that the intent of this provision is satisfied, rather than providing just the appearance of compliance. Many times, particularly when safety nets have been rigged, they have been allowed to become very slack, and have sometimes been secured only at their top ends. The improper rigging of safety nets compromises or even removes the protection provided to falling employees. In these very critical fall hazard situations, this provision insists that fully considered precautions are taken. The Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC) Rule 1016 (Ex. 1&hyph;145) is very similar in construction. This paragraph has also been revised to distinguish between the purpose and use of vertical safety nets, which rise at right angles at the perimeter of a work surface thus preventing employees from falling, and trapeze nets, which are designed to be placed horizontally below a raised work surface to prevent falling employees from striking the surface below. Additionally, this section requires that any nets used for purposes of fall protection meet the applicable requirements. Proposed 1918.33(a) and (b) are carried over from the current Longshoring rules. As the heading of this section indicates, these provisions address the safe performance of work on or around deck loads. Provisions for work performed by employees atop deck-stowed intermodal containers will be found at proposed 1918.85(j). OSHA is proposing to change the title and text of 1918.34. The current title of this section is ``Skeleton decks.'' OSHA has consulted, without success, numerous individuals from the maritime community and researched several maritime publications, textbooks, etc. in an effort to define the terms ``skeleton deck'' and ``mechano deck.'' OSHA feels that the use of these terms and the practice of working cargo on these particular types of decks are obsolete. Since the hazards remain even though these terms do not, OSHA is proposing to change the title of the section to ``Other decks'' in order to group unique or uncommon decks; using generic language to address the hazards associated with landing cargo on such decks that are not designed for such use. OSHA encourages the public to comment on whether the terms ``skeleton deck'' and ``mechano deck'' should be kept in the text of the standard and on whether these provisions are necessary. Proposed 1918.35 addresses hazards longshore workers face when conducting operations around open weather deck hatchways. Vessels calling at U.S. ports are of varied designs and capabilities. Some vessels have coamings, which are the vertical structure that surrounds the hatch opening on a ship, that are substantially higher than the proposed section's minimum acceptable range (36 to 42 inches) (.92 to 1.07 m) other vessels may have no hatch coamings at all, but rather flush decks or decks with an abbreviated sill, which present substantial fall hazards to longshore workers. On such vessels, when workers work around the perimeter of open hatchways, appropriate guarding must be provided. This proposal stipulates that taut lines or guardrails attaining the acceptable range be erected on all but the working side of the hatch. This proposal mandates that stanchions or uprights used in their construction be supported or secured in a manner that will prevent them from coming accidentally loose. Proposed 1918.37 addresses the fall hazards associated with working on the decks of lighters and barges. Proposed paragraph (a) retains language from the current rule. It prohibits the use of marginal (less than 3 feet (.92 m) wide) deck space along the sides of covered lighters or barges on all such vessels having coamings over 5 feet (1.5 m) high. Alternately, an employer must provide a taut handline or, as is most often the case, the vessel must be fitted with a serviceable grab rail. Proposed paragraph (b), also retains language from the current rule. It prohibits working or walking on unsound surfaces. This can be a particularly important consideration on barges, in that powered industrial trucks are often brought aboard to assist in operations. The proposed rule requires a visual check of such decks before loading operations begin. If during the course of discharge operations an unsafe surface is discovered, work must be discontinued until protective measures are taken (such as bridging the unsafe surface with steel plate or barricading a deck section deemed unsafe). Proposed 1918.38, as well as 1918.88 titled ``log operations'' are entirely new sections addressing log loading operations and reflect current industry practice. Section 1918.38 is based on Rules 640 and 641 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145); on a report on log operations submitted to OSHA's Maritime Safety Standards Office by Region X (Ex. 1&hyph;146); and a training video on log operations produced by the PMA and ILWU (Ex. 1&hyph;147). Loading logs from water presents very serious falling and drowning hazards. Thus, safe walking working surfaces are extremely important to longshore workers who are positioned offshore during log loading operations. Sound footing is essential during access to and while working on log rafts, which are in fact the cargo. The proposed requirements provide for safe access to the worksite and a safe working surface area. The working surface must be wide enough to allow for stable footing, securely fastened together, and substantial enough to support the weight of the employees on it. OSHA has concluded that the basic requirements for providing such safe surfaces should be included in this rulemaking, and seeks comment on their completeness. Subpart E_Opening and closing hatches Proposed 1918.41 addresses coaming clearances and provides requirements to protect longshore workers from fall hazards and from being struck by falling cargo during the process of opening up and closing hatches. Proposed paragraph (a) addresses weather deck clearances. When a smooth-sided deck load is stowed within 3 feet (.92 m) of the hatch coaming, and the available coaming height is <24 inches, a taut handline shall be provided so that employees are able to safely remove or replace hatch beams and covers. Similar language covering such situations is found in the NYSA/ILA Joint Maritime Safety Code_part C/Rule 38 (Ex. 1&hyph;2) and the PCMSC_Rule 1007 (Ex. 1&hyph;145). Throughout this proposal, OSHA has specified that ``taut'' lines or ``taut'' handrails or guardrails be provided in certain situations where available walking or working space is compromised because of inevitable stowage or vessel design considerations. In using the term taut, as with other terms commonly encountered in maritime safety codes, OSHA is using language which is familiar in the industry under current practices. Where necessary, OSHA is proposing definitions for various terms used in the proposed standards, to ensure that these terms are uniformly understood. To be as clear as possible with regard to its intention in utilizing the term ``taut'' in connection with the subject lines, handrails and guardrails, the Agency states that ``taut'' connotes tightly and securely drawn, and as length and distance may warrant, securely fastened at intervals. The idea behind providing these taut lines, etc., is to allow an employee to rely on these objects in maintaining or regaining a stable balance in a constrained work area. Generally, guardrails successfully serve their purpose when their height can stay within a serviceable range (42 to 36 inches) (1.07 m to .92 m). ``Taut'' handrails and ``taut'' lines, however, are sometimes required to be fitted to objects and structures of varying dimensions (such as deck cargo and the sides of covered lighters) for the purpose of enabling an employee to maintain balance and footing. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) addresses intermediate deck hatchway clearance, and requires that a 3 foot (.91 m) clear work area be provided between stowed cargo and hatch coaming at both sides and one end of hatches with athwartship beams, and at both ends of hatches with fore and aft beams, while employees are engaged in opening or closing the hatchway. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) makes it clear that the 3-foot (.91 m) working surface under proposed paragraph (b)(1), is not required when a fall hazard is not present. Proposed paragraph (b)(3) recognizes that fitted grating over-decking, such as the type used in some perishables trades, can be considered part of the actual deck or working space (for the purposes of assessing compliance with proposed paragraph (b)(1)), if they are properly placed within the 3-foot clearance area and if they are in good condition (flush fitting and presenting a level work surface). OSHA has dropped the reference to ``banana'' gratings because OSHA feels it is an unnecessary reference. Proposed paragraph (c) would require grab rails or taut hand lines to be provided where, because of wing-space structures or spare parts storage, coaming clearance is minimized. Proposed paragraph (d) advises that this proposed section is inapplicable in situations that permit the opening and closing of hatches without employees having to place or remove individual sections manually. It cautions, however, that whenever the 3-foot clearance is lacking, cargo which is likely to shift or fall must be blocked or otherwise restrained. Proposed 1918.42, similar to 1918.41, is carried over substantively in its entirety from the current longshore rules, although some editing has been done for clarity. Provisions in this section addresses the hazards associated with handling hatch beams and pontoons, such as falling into the hatch or being struck by these removable items. Equivalent rules can be found on section 2 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and parts C and O of the NYSA/ILA Joint Maritime Safety Code (Ex. 1&hyph;2). In summary, it is proposed that hatch beam and pontoon bridles be long enough to easily fit their attachment points. Hatch beam bridles must be equipped with attachment devices that cannot become accidentally dislodged, such as toggles. Pontoon bridles are required to have the appropriate number of legs to conform to the design of the cover. All such legs must be utilized when lifting. If all legs of a bridle cannot be used due to the design of the cover, the spare leg(s) must be prevented from free swinging. Finally, as for the construction of these bridles, OSHA requires that for proper manual guidance, at least two legs be fitted with a fibre rope lanyard, and that the bridle end of the lanyard (the end attached directly to the bridle) be constructed of chain or wire rope. Proposed 1918.43 is generally carried over from the current longshore rules, with some changes made for clarity, a revision to paragraph (j), and the addition of a new paragraph (i). Provisions in this section address the hazards associated with handling and stowing of hatch boards, hatch beams, and pontoons, such as falling into the hatch or being struck by improperly stowed items. Similar requirements are found in Section X of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145), part O of the NYSA/ILA code (Ex. 1&hyph;2), and ILO Convention 152. In revised paragraph (j), tarpaulins may be used to reduce the dust emissions of bulk cargoes instead of night tents if the vessel lacks cargo gear. In these situations, OSHA requires positive means, such as placards or barricades, be taken to prevent employees from walking on the tarpaulin that is covering an open or partially open hatch. Verbal warnings or instructions do not satisfy this provision. A new paragraph (i) is being proposed to address the hazards of unsecured materials falling from hatch covers when they are being moved overhead. Subpart F_Vessel's Cargo Handling Gear Proposed subpart F would apply to all gear and equipment used in cargo handling that is the property of the vessel. Examples of this type of equipment can include cranes, derricks, specialized bridles, winches, wire rope, and shackles. This subpart addresses hazards associated with the use of that gear. This would include such hazards as using faulty gear, overloading or improperly rigging cargo gear, or improper operation of cargo gear, which can result in serious injury or death. (See Ex. 1&hyph;103.) Proposed 1918.51 contains general requirements that apply to all cargo handling equipment that is permanently attached to a vessel. Proposed paragraph (a) stipulates that the safe working load of the gear, whether marked on the lifting appliance itself or specified in the required certificates/gear register, shall not be exceeded. Proposed paragraph (b) requires that each component of ship's cargo handling gear be inspected by the employer before use, and at intervals during use. This requirement is more clearly worded than the existing requirement by specifying the employer's obligation to perform a visual inspection. Also, this new language more closely parallels the shoreside requirement found in 29 CFR 1917.42(a)(2). The paragraph also prohibits the use of unsafe gear. Proposed paragraph (c) provides criteria for splicing wire rope and for wire rope configuration characteristics. Additionally, the paragraph conforms the Longshore regulations to some current use criteria for wire rope that appear in OSHA's rules for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (Marine Terminals_29 CFR part 1917). Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (f), also parallel the shore side rules. OSHA believes that the new language in this section enhances the safety of the worker in several ways. In paragraph (c), new and more stringent requirements are proposed for wire rope that is part of the ship's cargo handling gear. In addition, the new provisions (paragraphs (d), (e), and (f)) set replacement criteria for wire rope slings, natural and synthetic fibre rope slings, synthetic web slings, chains and chain slings, none of which are addressed by the existing standard. Proposed 1918.52, 1918.53, and 1918.54 and all address the subject of rigging and operating vessel's cargo handling gear. By and large, the requirements of these sections are found in the existing rule. Some language modifications have been made to enhance clarity. In addition, some paragraphs have new language that enhances the understanding of the provision which promotes greater compliance and eases enforcement burdens. For example, proposed 1918.53(e) adds to the existing reporting requirement of a defective winch, the following requirement ``... and the winch shall not be used until the defect or malfunction is corrected.'' Similarly, paragraph (i) adds a monitoring requirement during operation and (k) removes a feasibility exception based on design that is no longer necessary today due to technological improvements. OSHA wishes to raise the issue and solicit comment from the public regarding whether or not to delete 1918.52(b). This paragraph addresses the use of chain topping lift stoppers and clamp type stoppers that are used to manually lower and raise the boom. This method of topping the boom is a potentially dangerous operation and has been largely replaced by the use of electric topping lift winches, which do not require the use of stoppers. However, OSHA understands that as a result of the breakup of the Soviet Union, vessels which had not been allowed to sail into the U.S. because of restrictions placed on Soviet bloc countries, are now calling on various ports of the United States. In some cases, these vessels are old, and have types of cargo handling gear that had been largely replaced by more modern gear. In light of this occurrence, OSHA solicits public comment on this issue. A new paragraph has been added, 1918.54(a), that addresses the hazard associated with the poor practice of rigging guys or preventers so that they chafe against other guys, preventers, or stays. This practice can cause the vessels's cargo gear to fail as the chafing can cause the wires to separate. This can lead to serious injury or death as the gear and cargo fall down on the deck or into the hold. Proposed 1918.55 covers deck cranes permanently affixed to a vessel. The existing rule only addresses one of the hazards_the guarding of the swing radius. The new requirements more completely address the hazards encountered in the use of ship's cranes. These rules become necessary due to the widespread replacement of winches and booms by ship's cranes on newer vessels. In addition, the new provisions closely parallel similar shoreside requirements in part 1917 and other OSHA crane standards. This section prohibits the use of cranes which develop a visible or known defect that impacts on its safe operation. In addition, the operator's position must be well maintained, with good visibility provided through the operator cab's glass. During cargo operations, areas that are within the swing radius of the body of revolving cranes and are accessible to employees must be guarded to prevent an employee from being caught between the body of the crane and any fixed structure, or between parts of the crane. Paragraph (c) of 1918.55 also addresses the danger of employees being caught between shipboard gantry cranes, such as would be found on a LASH (Lighter aboard ship) vessel or a self contained container ship, and fixed structures on deck along the path of the cranes travel. (Ex. 1&hyph;103, cases 26 and 27). Crane brakes must be monitored throughout the workshift. If they are unable to hold the load, the crane must not be used. If cranes are used in tandem, a designated person (see definitions) must direct the operation with special emphasis on positioning, rigging and movement. Subpart G_Cargo Handling Gear and Equipment Other than Ship's Gear Proposed Subpart G applies to all cargo handling gear utilized in cargo operations that is not part of the vessel (ship's gear). Proposed 1918.61 is very broad in its coverage. In paragraph (a) it stipulates that all gear and equipment brought aboard a vessel must be inspected before and during its use by the employer or a designated person to determine its condition. If, upon inspection, an unsafe condition is found, the gear must not be used until deficiencies are corrected. Proposed paragraph (b)(1) is carried over from the current longshore rules and requires that the Safe Working Load (SWL) of the gear not be exceeded. Proposed paragraph (b)(2) is new. This paragraph requires the marking of the SWL on special stevedoring gear with a safe working load (SWL) of over five short tons. OSHA believes that this is a basic requirement (Ex. 1&hyph;151), and that most gear in use is already marked with the SWL on it. Paragraph (c), which is similar to the current language, stipulates that the weight of any article of stevedoring gear that exceeds 2,000 pounds (1 short ton) must be plainly marked with the weight of that article before being hoisted by the ship's gear. Examples of such stevedoring gear are container handling lifting frames and certain multi-point engagement bridles. It is important to consider the weight of such articles when evaluating safe working loads of the ship's cargo gear. This is because the weight of the gear must be added to the weight of the load being lifted to determine the actual load, which together cannot exceed the SWL. Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) remain unchanged and address certification and certification procedures. Proposed paragraph (f) addresses special stevedoring gear fabricated of components that are not common, off-the-shelf type items. For example, gear room constructed spreader bars for heavy lift cargo, special lifting devices for unique pieces of cargo, or bar pallet bridles will have some components that are not marketed or purchased with a specific cargo handling use in mind. Such certification must be performed in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) by an agency accredited by the Department of Labor under 29 CFR part 1919 before being put into use. Also, all intermodal container spreaders that are supplied by the stevedore for hoisting afloat shall be similarly inspected, tested, and certificated. Special stevedoring gear with a SWL of five short tons or less can continue to be inspected and tested as a unit by a designated person. OSHA is also proposing that all cargo handling gear covered by 1918.61(f) with a SWL greater than 5 short tons be inspected and proof load tested every four years in accordance with the chart found in paragraph (f) of this section. This inspection and proof load test may be done by an agency accredited by the U.S. Department of Labor under 29 CFR part 1919, or it can be done by a designated person. This change to the existing longshore regulations parallels similar requirements found in 29 CFR part 1917, Marine Terminals. For consistency between the two parts, OSHA is proposing in this rulemaking, to change 1917.50(b)(5) to reflect the 5 long ton exemption that is being proposed in 1918.61 and to require the periodic testing of special stevedoring gear and container spreaders every four years by a designated person, shoreside as well as shipside. OSHA feels that this will provide additional protection for those employees that use special stevedoring gear and will eliminate any confusion that may currently exist by requiring special stevedoring gear with a SWL greater than five long tons and spreaders supplied by the employer to be inspected, tested, and certificated whether it is used by shore-based material handling equipment or by cargo handling gear afloat. Proposed 1918.62 covers all miscellaneous gear that is not part of ship's gear, such as all slings, shackles, hooks, blocks and pallets (loose gear), employed aboard a vessel for use in cargo handling operations. The hazards addressed by this section are those generally associated with an employee's being struck by falling objects, i.e. dunnage, gear or cargo, when the gear fails. The provisions in this section helps to assure that loose gear used in the longshoring operation is both adequate in strength and size and in good enough condition to safely perform the operation. To foster uniformity, the Agency proposes the same requirements for miscellaneous gear as required in shoreside cargo handling at 29 CFR 1917.42. (See 46 FR 4194 and 48 FR 30895 for a full discussion of the rationale for these provisions.) OSHA proposes a comprehensive system of tables (See Appendix II) that will be utilized in the event that manufacturer's recommendations/certificates are not immediately available at the worksite for safe working load assessment. The tables are primarily based on ASME B30.9&hyph;1990 (Slings), (Ex. 1&hyph;148), as well as requirements applying to wire rope clips and shackles currently contained in the Agency's rules for Marine Terminals. It is OSHA's position that the manufacturers's recommended use and safe working load criteria, given the wide universe of international fabrication of all miscellaneous gear, are the most reliable factors to utilize in determining safe usage. However, the Agency appreciates that certificates or manufacturers' use recommendations may not be instantly available in certain circumstances. For instance, when inbound pre-slung drafts of cargo are ready for discharge at a given port, certificates or use recommendations might not be found aboard the vessel. Because such pieces of miscellaneous gear are not ``ship's gear,'' it is likely that no data on them will appear within the ship's collection of certificates. Likewise, such gear cannot be properly classified as ``stevedore supplied gear,'' for the stevedore will not have known the characteristics of the slings until the hatch section is actually observed. In these circumstances, the tables found in Appendix II can be relied upon to provide a realistic safe working load. In accordance with I.L.O. recommendation 160 (Ex. 1&hyph;8), OSHA, in proposed requirement 1918.62(h)(5)(ii), has added wording to prohibit the use of wrought iron in new parts of lifting appliances or loose gear. As a practical matter, wrought iron is rarely seen on vessels that are trading today. However, as with many of the regulations in this rule that have reduced application, there is the possibility that such conditions may still exist, and for that reason the relevant standards are being left in the proposal. OSHA invites the public to comment on this matter. Finally, a new paragraph is proposed to be added, (g)(2)(vi), that adds an additional criterion to cause a synthetic web sling to be removed from service. If warning threads or markers that the manufacturer has designed to indicate excessive wear or damage are visible, than the sling must be removed from service. Proposed 1918.63 and 1918.64 provide requirements for the use of chutes, rollers and both gravity and mechanically powered conveyors. OSHA proposes to bring into part 1918 the requirements that cover such pieces of equipment within the shoreside (29 CFR 1917.48 and 1917.49) rules. In this manner, no regulatory disparity will exist with equipment that often physically originates on shore and extends onto the ship. (See 46 FR 4208 and 48 FR 30900 for a full discussion of the rationale for these provisions as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.) Notable among the changes brought about by bringing those shoreside rules aboard vessels, is the requirement that powered conveyors be locked out and tagged during most maintenance, repair, and serving. Also, that same procedure would be required in most situations that require the removal of a jam or overload on the powered conveyor system. Proposed 1918.65 covers the use of all mechanically powered vehicles brought aboard vessels to conduct or assist in cargo handling operations. Included in this category of equipment are all industrial trucks and all bulk cargo moving vehicles. In that these same vehicles are similarly utilized in the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling, the hazards are essentially the same. These would include, among others, exceeding the safe working capacity of the vehicle; cargo falling on the operator either from stowage on the vessel or from being handled by the vehicle itself; improper maintenance which could lead to unsafe operation of the vehicle; and the falling hazards associated with the lifting of personnel by mechanically powered vehicles. Therefore, OSHA has proposed to track the requirements found in 1917.43 that are applicable to this class of equipment. (See 46 FR 4197 and 48 FR 30896 for a full discussion of the rationale of these provisions as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.) Additionally, the Agency is proposing a requirement for roll-over protection on bulk cargo moving vehicles (such as the type used to trim and position bulk cargo in underdeck spaces). Such protection is required on similar pieces of equipment used in construction industry settings, where the hazard posed by turnover also exists. OSHA seeks comment on whether this provision provides adequate protection shipside and whether similar protection is needed shoreside. OSHA is proposing, in 1918.65(g), that vehicles purchased after the effective date of the final rule shall be equipped with parking brakes. OSHA believes that, although most older equipment may not be equipped with parking brakes, equipment that is currently being manufactured is generally equipped with such brakes. A parking brake is especially important when working Ro-Ro type vessels where the ramps can have a steep grade. Proposed 1918.66 covers all cranes and derricks which are not part of a vessel's permanent cargo handling gear, but are placed aboard a vessel temporarily to conduct cargo operations. As an example, mobile and crawler type cranes are at times positioned upon barges and thereupon transported to locations adjacent to a vessel to load and discharge cargo. Given that these hoisting devices are identical at both the shoreside and shipboard location, the hazards associated with the operation of this equipment are basically the same. These would include, among others, exceeding the safe working capacity of the crane or derrick; improper operation; improper maintenance; exposed mechanical moving parts; falling hazards associated with lifting personnel; and crushing hazards. Therefore, OSHA has relied upon its rules for cranes and derricks found in 29 CFR 1917.45 to provide regulatory consistency to the marine cargo handling industrial sector. (See 46 FR 4201 and 48 FR 30897 for a full discussion of the rationale of these provisions as adopted in the Marine Terminal standard.) In one obvious departure from the foregoing principle, the Agency has chosen not to propose requirements for load indicating devices within this section for shipside cargo handling. Usually such devices rely upon boom radius (outreach) as a component determinant in arriving at a load indication. When afloat, however, boom radius can be compromised by load and stability factors, resulting in indications that are not accurate. OSHA seeks comment from interested persons as to whether this approach provides adequate safety. In addition, the Agency solicits comment on alternative means of preventing overloads of cranes used aboard ships. Are there reliable alternate devices (that do not use radius as a central component in arriving at a load indication) that are sufficiently developed to accurately indicate the weight of the load? Would load moment indicators provide equal or better protection. Are some systems more precise than others? What other procedures could be employed to prevent overload conditions? Additionally, proposed 1918.66(c)(2) requires that the hoisting mechanism of cranes and derricks, when being used to hoist personnel, shall operate in the power up and power down mode with automatic brake application when stopped. This provision is similar to the requirements found in the personnel hoisting section of the OSHA Construction standards at 29 CFR 1926.550(g)(ii)(D). Earlier OSHA had proposed such a rule for all cranes in the Marine Terminal Proposal (46 FR 4237) but comments and other record evidence convinced OSHA that, at the time, this would be infeasible for mobile cranes. The final Marine Terminal standard, promulgated in 1983, therefore, only applied this provision to overhead and container gantry cranes. However, in 1988, OSHA issued its Construction standard for Crane or Derrick Suspended Personnel Platforms, (29 CFR 1926.550(g); 53 FR 29116). This rulemaking reexamined the feasibility of the controlled load lowering provision and, based on the record evidence, OSHA determined that controlled load lowering was both feasible and necessary when using cranes to hoist employees. For a detailed discussion, see 53 FR 29122. In light of these findings, OSHA is proposing to include the controlled load lowering provision in this part, and to amend part 1917 (1917.45(j)(2)) to cover all cranes and derricks, including mobile cranes. OSHA wishes to emphasize that hoisting employees by crane is not a safe practice and should be used only where other means are not feasible. OSHA solicits comment on this issue. Proposed 1918.66(c)(3) is a new requirement has also been taken from the from OSHA's Construction Safety standards applicable to hoisting personnel. This requires that a crane used to lift personnel be equipped with an anti-two block device. This is a device which prevents the hoist block from coming into contact with the head block of the boom. Such ``two-blocking'' can occur when the operator is not paying attention to how high the hoist block is in relation to the head of the boom. After contact, continued hoisting of the block can cause the block to separate from the load line, or break the load line itself, causing the hoist block and load to fall. OSHA feels that this requirement is necessary to prevent serious injury or death to employees being hoisted by a crane. In the 1988 construction rulemaking, this requirement was also found to be both necessary and feasible. Proposed 1918.67 carries over the exact requirements currently found in OSHA's Longshoring rule at 1918.75. Paragraphs (a) and (b) both provide that the employer must obtain permission from the officer in charge of the vessel whenever internal combustion or electrically powered tools, equipment or vehicles are brought aboard, and whenever the ship's power is needed for operating the employer's electrical tools or equipment. These requirements are prudent, in that such employer-provided equipment may be incompatible with vessel systems and could lead to electrical and ventilation problems, among others. Proposed 1918.68 provides for the effective grounding of all portable electrical equipment, such as saws, drills, grinders, etc., through a separate equipment conductor that either runs with or encloses both circuit conductors. This represents a clarification of the current rule. Double-insulated tools and battery-operated tools are excluded from the requirements. Proposed 1918.69 is a section titled ``Tools.'' The current requirements with the same title are found in 1918.72, which addresses the safety devices that are required on portable tools, generally, and portable circular saws specifically. OSHA believes that the current OSHA General Industry standards, subpart P, titled ``Hand and Portable Powered Tools and Other Hand-Held Equipment'' comprehensively address the subject of portable tools. The hazards presented by these tools in this industry are no different than in general industry. Rather than repeating these requirements here, OSHA has decided to reference them in this proposal. Subpart H_Handling Cargo Proposed Subpart H specifically covers the cargo handling process. These sections (1918.81&hyph;89) address the hazards encountered by longshore workers while loading and unloading cargo. The primary hazards involve situations where the employee falls or is struck by cargo during the operation. In this subpart, OSHA is proposing to retain many of the rules currently found within subpart H of the current Longshoring standards (part 1918); to carry over applicable regulatory language from the Agency's rules for the shoreside segment of marine cargo handling (part 1917); and to add new requirements to account for occupational situations that are both unique to the shipboard workplace setting and up to date in their coverage of intermodal transport systems. Sections 1918.81 through 1918.84 address those hazards common to the handling of break bulk (or general) cargo. They require proper slinging, building, bulling and stowing drafts of cargo in order to prevent cargo from coming loose from the draft and falling on or tipping over on workers. Proposed paragraph (a) of 1918.81 is a general requirement for safety in the hoisting of slung drafts (loads hoisted by a sling or slings). Many factors can result in an unsafely slung draft. For instance, the wires of the sling may be placed on or around the cargo in a manner that causes a load to become unstable once it is hoisted. Such a situation can be recognized and effectively handled simply by rearranging the placement of the sling. Also, multi-tiered drafts are sometimes hoisted in a very unstable condition that is caused by one tier resting off center of another. Even a slight slacking of the gear can cause drafts slung in this manner to come apart. Readjustment of such drafts before hoisting can easily remedy that unsafe condition. Proposed paragraph (b) requires that slings attached to the lifting gear for handling more than one draft in succession be positively engaged to the hoisting system. This is usually accomplished by shackling the bridle (or sling) directly into the falls. Mousing (closing off) the throat of the cargo hook assembly, is not permitted. Proposed paragraph (c) provides protection for a common hazard encountered in break bulk cargo operations; that of being struck by sliding pieces of cargo or dunnage (shoring materials) that fall from the draft while in transit. There are at least two ways to correct such a situation: the first is to reconfigure the sling so that the top layer of the cargo is effectively engaged; the second is to secure the potential ``sliders'' to themselves (by banding them, for instance) or to the more substantial part of the draft. Proposed paragraphs (d), (e), and (h) are virtually identical to the current rules but are modified somewhat for clarity. Proposed paragraphs (f) and (g), on the other hand, are derived from the Marine Terminal standard which address the hoisting of ``unitized loads.'' Unitized loads are loads that are banded or strapped together into a unit. Hoisting hazards with such loads occur when the bands are used to hoist the load but were not designed to do so; and when hoisting is performed when the banding is damaged. (See full discussion at 46 FR 4189.) Proposed paragraph (i) requires that loads not be hoisted unless the crane or winch operator can clearly see the draft at all times, or, alternatively, can clearly see the signals given by a signal person who is observing the draft. This is particularly important in that many break bulk vessels in current use and under construction are being fitted with revolving deck cranes. When using booms rigged in union purchase (the rigging of two booms together to be used as one lifting unit) the position of the boom head (and thus the location of the load's ultimate place of landing) is pre-determined, rarely changed, and fairly reliable. By contrast, in using deck cranes, the position of the boom bead can be varied easily. Loads, therefore, can be landed at many more locations, causing increased exposure of personnel to being struck by loads. Effective signaling requires a clear observation of the load by the signalperson and of the signalperson by the operator. Proposed paragraph (k) provides that the employer must require employees to stay clear of the area beneath overhead drafts or descending lifting gear. The employer is obligated to train certain employees in correct and safe procedures associated with the job, and to require that employees adhere to the well established and enforced work rules that are contained in that training. (See full discussion at 46 FR 4194.) OSHA is also proposing to include the same language in the Marine Terminal standard in 1917.13(h). Proposed paragraph (l) prohibits riding of the load or the cargo engaging means. This precludes the utilization of any cargo or any cargo engaging device (hook, clamshell, grapple, etc.) as a personnel conveyance. This proposed paragraph does not cover, however, the riding of loaded intermodal container spreaders, which is addressed in 1918.85(g). In accordance with proposed 1918.23(b), specific latitude is afforded longshoring operations taking place on the Mississippi river system, where the use of a personnel basket may be used. However, careful consideration and consultation with the Agency is important in the exercise of that latitude. Proposed 1918.82 and 1918.83 (a) and (b) address the hazards of cargo becoming inadvertently dislodged from an improperly built draft or improper stowage and falling or shifting, thus striking workers. The language is virtually identical to the current longshore rule. 1918.83(c), however, addresses a different hazard_losing workers in the hold of a ship. Such a hazard is greatly enhanced when the worker is working alone or in an isolated area, such as in tanks or reefer compartments. Also, workers trimming grain could be lost in the cargo. To deal with these hazards, the proposed and current rules require an employee check-in, check-out system or frequent checks thereby accounting for the safety of employees working in these conditions. Proposed 1918.84 addresses the ``bulling'' of cargo. Bulling is the horizontal dragging of cargo (across a deck space) with none of the weight of the cargo supported by the hoisting wire(s). In practice, this procedure is accomplished with power generally provided by the cargo winch (with the hoist runner led out through the heel block), and then to an angled system of ``fairleads'' that provide mechanical advantage in achieving a horizontal pull on the cargo. The paragraphs that comprise this section are all taken from the current part 1918 regulations, but have been somewhat clarified and reordered into a more logical sequence. They are also covered (in part) within the NYSA-ILA Safety Code (Ex. 1&hyph;2) and the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145). Proposed 1918.85 applies to containerized cargo operations of any form. The proposed paragraphs track both the current Longshoring standards of part 1918, as well as the shoreside requirements found in the Marine Terminals rule (part 1917). In summary, each intermodal container (see definition at 1918.2(h)) must be marked with its gross, net, and tare (empty) weights. Generally, containers must be weighed before being hoisted aboard a vessel, to arrive at an actual gross weight. No container is permitted to be hoisted aboard a vessel if its actual gross weight exceeds either the maximum gross weight marked on the container or the safe working load of the gear that is being utilized to load the ship. In the case of containers coming from foreign ports, container weights must be determined by utilizing data provided in shipping documents or, as is most often the case, by weights shown on cargo stow plans. Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the topic of overloaded intermodal containers. This issue has raised a good deal of international concern (Exs. 1&hyph;120, 1&hyph;121, 1&hyph;122, 1&hyph;123, 1&hyph;124, 1&hyph;125, 1&hyph;126). The proposed provisions largely reflect the current rules in both the Longshore and Marine Terminal standards. OSHA feels that the protection afforded by its rules as they pertain to outbound (export) containers, namely that with few exceptions all are weighed before hoisting, will permit very few overweight loads going out from U.S. ports. The reliability of manifested or stow plan weights of containers coming into U.S. ports, however, appears to be in serious question as documented by the previous exhibits. The question then becomes, whether there is a better method of determining the actual weights of these containers, and how should such a method be implemented in the standards. The Agency requests interested persons to submit comment into the record concerning both as to the Agency's perception of the problem, and what better regulatory approach OSHA may take in seeking resolution. For instance, instead of relying upon the proposed language of this section, should OSHA require that container handling gantry cranes (currently exempted from the rule requiring a load indicating device_ 1918.74(a)(9)(viii)) be fitted with such a piece of equipment? In addition, a new proposed 1918.85(b)(6) has been added as a result of OSHA Instruction STD 2.2 dated July 3, 1989 (Ex. 1&hyph;114). Prior to the issuance of this instruction, the rule required closed containers loaded only with automobiles to be weighed. This instruction (and the language of this paragraph) allows closed dry van containers that have been loaded with vehicles to be loaded onto a vessel without being weighed on a scale. By contrast, other loaded containers, other than open top containers and containers solely used for the carriage of compressed gases, have to be weighed on a scale before being loaded onto a vessel. The reasoning behind the Instruction and this paragraph is that the weight of the vehicles inside a container will not exceed the net weight that the container itself is designed to carry. There are, however, three conditions that must be met in order for this exception to apply. First, the container must only contain assembled vehicles and no other cargo; second, the container must be marked on the outside so that an employee can readily discern that the container is carrying vehicles; and finally, the vehicles must have been loaded at the marine terminal. This paragraph is also to be proposed to be put into the Marine Terminal standard as 29 CFR 1917.71(b)(6). Proposed paragraph (d) addresses the hazard of handling a defective container. Although existing 1918.85(d) addresses the inspection of both outbound and inbound containers for visible defects, the proposed language does not mention the limitation of outbound or inbound. With regard to outbound containers, the hazards associated with handling a defective container are effectively covered by 1917.71(g) of the Marine Terminal standard. In this paragraph, OSHA chooses not to limit the inspection requirement to only inbound containers since certain other containers, including possibly defective ones, may need to be shifted in order to discharge an inbound container. Since a defective outbound container can create an identical hazard to the worker as does a defective inbound container, this proposal makes no distinction between the two. Finally, the provisions for handling a defective container remain the same as the current requirements: special safe handling or emptying of the container. In proposed paragraph (e), the Agency would require that employees be required to stay clear of the area beneath suspended containers. Accidents of an extremely serious nature have occurred in recent years (Ex. 1&hyph;37, 1&hyph;87) that highlight the need to propose this provision. Additionally, the Agency has such a requirement in its shoreside rules (1917.71(d)(2)). Proposed paragraph (f) on lifting fittings contains identical language to that found in the Agency's shoreside rules (1917.71(f)). Discussion is warranted, however, on the need to apply paragraph (f)(1)(i) on board ships. Often, particularly in below deck stowage on conventional break bulk vessels, it may be tempting to utilize ship's gear or shoreside mobile cranes and rig four leg bridles with hooks (engaging the four top corner castings) to facilitate easier stowage. In handling loaded containers, this practice is dangerous and is prohibited. The International Cargo Handling Coordination Association (ICHCA), has published a paper entitled ``The Safe Handling of ISO Freight Containers with Hooks *&blank;*&blank;*\u00a7'' that clearly outlines the inherent dangers of this practice (Ex. 1&hyph;13) as well as methods to accomplish stowage safely in such situations. Additionally, other international standards exist (Exs. 1&hyph;115, 1&hyph;116 and 1&hyph;117) that recommend that loaded containers only be lifted vertically when being handled from the top. Any method of lifting containers that is not vertical places undue stress which could lead to failure of the container. OSHA believes that this regulatory approach is well taken and reasonable. In proposed paragraph (g), the Agency requires that a safe means of access and egress be provided to each employee who, due to the nature of the work, must work atop stowed containers_both above and below deck. In practice, most employees gain such access by riding aboard safety platforms installed on container crane lifting frames. Such means are permissible when conducted in a manner consistent with design requirements found in the shoreside rules (1917.45(j)). While the shoreside rules already apply whenever a shore-based crane acts as the personnel conveyance, this proposed paragraph (which incorporates by reference the shoreside design criteria) provides for the same requirements to apply whenever shipboard equipment carries out the same function. Proposed paragraph (h) applies on vessels so equipped, to any loaded intermodal container spreader. It is well known throughout the industry that there are significant risks associated with riding a loaded container spreader. ``Free falls'' (or the unintended release of a container from a spreader), although infrequent, occur only while under load (Exs. 1&hyph;25 and 1&hyph;26). Additionally, having riders aboard a loaded spreader adds to the responsibilities of the crane operator, and whose attention is already occupied with the task of getting the containers to their intended location. The Agency is proposing a similar prohibition for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (part 1917) as part of this proposal, proposed 1917.45(j)(9). In proposed paragraph (i), OSHA would require (when safer methods are available) that ladders not be used to gain access to the tops of containers that are stowed greater than two high. The Agency deems gaining access by means of a properly designed and conveyed personnel platform (such as those often found on intermodal container spreaders) as being safer than employing ladders in climbing to heights that can attain 50. ft or more (Ex. 1&hyph;10). Proposed paragraph (j) covers the hazard of falling from the tops of intermodal containers. This hazard has long been recognized by the stevedoring industry as both extremely dangerous and difficult to prevent. Although constituting a small percentage of the total number of shipboard accidents in the United States, falls from the tops of containers have resulted in a number of serious occupational injuries and fatalities (Exs. 1&hyph;18, 1&hyph;19, 1&hyph;20, 1&hyph;21, 1&hyph;22, 1&hyph;23, 1&hyph;24, 1&hyph;43, 1&hyph;67, 1&hyph;68, 1&hyph;100, 1&hyph;108). As early as 1968, U.S. terminal operators recognized the need to improve container top safety. Matson Terminals, Inc., in conjunction with their parent ocean operator, Matson Navigation Company, developed the first system of container top fall protection within the worldwide intermodal network (Ex. 1&hyph;53). In that system, Matson provided for a ``D'' ring fixture to be installed within the roof of each company-owned intermodal container. Employees working aloft were provided with a safety belt and lanyard that could be secured to the ``D'' ring anchorage. For a number of reasons, use of the system proved to be difficult, and it is not widely used today. In 1970, OSHA's predecessor agency, the Bureau of Labor Standards, was contacted by the Coast Labor Relations Committee of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, who raised this issue specifically. In their letter of August 24, 1970 (Ex. 1&hyph;50), the Coast Committee asserted: Consider if you will the dangers attendant to working atop containers. They are not equipped with skidproof surfaces, there are no protective railings, and there are no requirements that safety belts be provided. In dry warm weather such work is dangerous enough, but the dangers are critically compounded when workers must labor atop these during windy and wet weather. At the very least, BLS regulations ought to provide that *&blank;*&blank;* safety belts be [required] for men working aloft. As the containerized transport revolution progressed during the 1970's and into the 1980's, and intermodal containers become more common in the cargo handling trades, container top exposures increased proportionately. At that time, there was no specific container top safety provision in the Longshoring standards. The Agency issued citations under the General Duty Clause (Section 5(a)(190) of the Act and 1918.32(b) of OSHA's rules for Longshoring (Exs. 1&hyph;139). The latter provision states, in the context of applying to stowed cargo and temporary landing platforms: When the edge of a hatch section or stowed cargo more than 8 feet high is so exposed that it presents a danger of an employer falling, the edge shall be guarded by a safety net of adequate strength to prevent injury to a falling employee, or by other means protection equal protection under the existing circumstances. Although there were questions regarding the applicability of 1918.32(b) to container operations, it was determined that the provision did indeed have application to container top on-deck exposures. In an Instruction to the Field (CPL 2&hyph;1.17) dated August 30, 1982, the Agency's policy on the issue was spelled out (Ex. 1&hyph;49). In that instruction, OSHA determined that although the 1918.32(b) provision applied, there would be situations where the abatement of the container fall hazard was not feasible. In such situations, the instruction noted: A violation (of 1918.32(b)) shall not be issued; however, OSHA should recommend and encourage the employer to work toward a solution and assist the employer in every way possible to effect a means of protection by advice, consultation and dissemination of information obtained during other inspections. With the onset of containerized cargo handling, it became necessary to secure containers (not placed in cell guides) to each other to prevent unintentional movement during transit. To achieve this stability, workers placed stacking cones in the corner castings of the container (``coning'') while the containers were being loaded on the ship. While the containers were unloaded from the ship, workers removed stacking cones from the corner castings of the container (``deconing''). The original stacking cones were replaced in the early 1970's by conventional twistlocks which eliminated the need for some lashing but still required workers to climb on top of the containers to place or remove them. Today twistlocks are the most commonly used fitting for securing freight containers onboard vessels (Ex. 1&hyph;140). Semi-automatic twistlocks, developed in the mid 1980's, eliminate the need for some lashing but also eliminate the need for workers to go on top of the containers for the purposes of coning and deconing. While some work performed on container tops remains unaffected by the use of SATLs, most of the work that would otherwise require workers to go atop containers could be eliminated. The use of these devices could, effectively, ``engineer out'' exposure to container top falling hazards. Industry efforts to find feasible methods for container top fall hazard abatement received a significant impetus when, on June 27, 1985, Longshore Division members of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU) called a work stoppage that put at a standstill all container operations at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, California. The work stoppage (Ex. 1&hyph;42) punctuated the ILWU's concern over a series of work related deaths that occurred over a 14-month period. Although only one of these occupational fatalities was attributable to container top exposure, the labor union insisted that an effective work rule to minimize the hazards associated with container top work be instituted, and asserted that such a work rule was central to averting a continued work stoppage. On July 1, 1985, the ILWU and the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA), acting as management's representative, agreed upon a package of 25 work rules that were specifically designed to enhance safety at container terminals. That successful management and labor agreement led to the resumption of work. Internationally, a number of national and multi-national organizations are aware of and have acted upon the problem. The International Labor Organization, in its Code of Practice for Safety and Health in Dockwork (Ex. 1&hyph;130) specifically requires that: A person gaining access to the top of a container should be adequately protected against the danger of falling where appropriate by wearing a suitable safety harness properly tethered, or by other effective means, whilst on the container. In its Directions for Safety in Dockwork, the National Swedish Board of Occupational Safety and Health (Ex. 1&hyph;131) provides, in pertinent part, that: Work on top of a container is only permissible if measures have been taken to prevent falling down. In the Netherlands, the Inspectorate of Dock Labor notes (Ex. 1&hyph;44) that: For general containertop [sic] safety in most cases the recommendations of I.L.O. and ICHCA are followed. In the port of Hamburg, Germany, a ``lash basket'' designed by a dockworker (Ex. 1&hyph;45) rides underneath the container spreader and moves between container stows, minimizing containertop exposures. Also, in the port of Bremerhaven, a specially designed ``rigger box,'' which is similar in configuration to some U.S. designs, protects dockworkers who go on top of containers in that port (Ex. 1&hyph;52). In the wake of a fatal accident that occurred in a New Zealand port in 1979, the New Zealand section of ICHCA responded by conducting and publishing a study, entitled: ``Container Top Safety_An Overview'' (Ex. 1&hyph;46). In that study, ICHCA analyzed the problem and a number of possible solutions, among them having the employee tethered to a fixed anchorage. Other tentative solutions arrived at by a number of worldwide locales were also discussed. OSHA believes that longshore workers who work on container tops are exposed to fall hazards that can cause serious injury or death. Containers are typically stacked from one to nine below deck and one to six above deck. The loading and unloading procedures typically require a worker to place and remove container stacking alignment cones in and from the container's corner castings. This means that workers performing these tasks are regularly exposed to falling hazards of up to 90 feet (27.3 m). Within the last few years, advances have been made in the technology of securing intermodal containers which have had a dramatic effect on container top safety. The use of positive container securing devices or systems, such as semi-automatic twistlocks (SATL) and above deck cell guides, can nearly eliminate the need for workers to work on the tops of containers thereby eliminating the falling hazard. Although OSHA has participated in an ongoing dialogue with industry, labor, the international cargo handling community, and others interested in how these technologies can improve worker safety, actual record evidence is somewhat limited. However, OSHA's information does include a comprehensive study prepared by a safety expert under contract to OSHA that addresses the hazards associated with containerized cargo handling (Ex. 1&hyph;139); an ICHCA Safety Panel Research Paper addressing the use of semi-automatic twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;140); a time-and-motion study comparing the use of conventional twistlocks (also referred to as manual twistlocks) with semi-automatic twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;141); safety information produced by the United Kingdom (U.K.) addressing jammed container fittings (Ex. 1&hyph;142); an article published by a U.K. terminal association that addresses the freeing of jammed twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;143); and a newsletter from an insurance company addressing container twistlocks (Ex. 1&hyph;144). The ICHCA study is the most comprehensive study on the SATL experience (Ex. 1&hyph;140). This study defines SATL at page 3 as follows: Semi-Automatic Twistlock (SATL)_A twistlock which will automatically engage in the locked position when the locking mechanism has been triggered by the weight of the container as it is landed onto another container or deck foundation. Since prototypes were first developed in Japan in the mid 1980's, manufacturers around the world have made improvements on the design which enhance both durability and reliability. (Id.) In fact, the ICHCA study indicates the existence of approximately 22 different models of SATLs (Id. P. 6). Manufacturers indicate that, with proper use and maintenance, the average lifespan of the SATL in the marine environment would be about the same as a conventional twistlock_about 10 years (Id. p. 59). As indicated in both the ICHCA study (Id.) and the OSHA study (Ex. 1&hyph;139), the use of SATLs is widespread throughout the world and the United States. In fact, OSHA estimates that over 25 percent of ships calling in U.S. ports are already utilizing SATLs. Proponents of the use of SATLs argue that the device avoids accidents and saves money. Unlike conventional twistlocks, which must be inserted by workers on top of the container and manually locked, semi-automatic twistlocks are inserted into the bottom of the container by workers standing on the dock and lock automatically when placed upon another container. Both SATLs and conventional twistlocks can be unlocked by workers standing on the deck of the ship using an actuator pole. In the case of unloading with the conventional twistlock, the upper container is then removed leaving the twistlocks on the top of the lower container. The major operational distinction is that workers must remove conventional twistlocks from the top of a shipboard container before the spreader can attach to the corner castings, while the SATL is designed to remain attached to the bottom of the container being unloaded. SATLs are then removed by workers standing on the dock. This operation using SATLs, therefore, eliminates worker exposure to falling hazards. Finally, proponents argue that the use of SATLs enhances productivity and reduces lashing costs. (Ex. 1&hyph;140, p. 76; Ex. 1&hyph;141). In fact, a time-and-motion study that compares the performance of conventional twistlocks to that of SATLs indicates an increase in productivity in the range of 25 to 29 percent. This translates to a 11.1 percent reduction in stevedoring costs (Ex. 1&hyph;141, p. 4 and 5; Ex. 2). To the extent that this study is representative of all container cargo handling operations affected by this rule, it indicates substantial reductions of fall hazards by the use of SATLs. OSHA seeks comment from interested parties including any additional data or studies that address this issue. As indicated above, another advancement in securing containers in transit that eliminates the need for workers to go on top of containers is the development of above deck cell guides. Cell guides are rigid, structural members that form cells where containers are stowed. These cell guides allow for the ready placement of containers in a manner that prevents movement once so placed. Although cell guides in the hold are common in container ships, above deck cell guides are far less common, constituting only 2 percent (Ex. 2, pgs. 2&hyph;19) of container ships calling at U.S. ports. In addition, OSHA is aware of the existence of positive container securing devices other than those discussed above, such as the SeaLand framing system (Ex. 1&hyph;57), OSHA believes that use of the term ``positive container securing devices'' is broad enough to allow for innovative technological improvement. While the use of SATLs is the most widespread method of positively securing containers that eliminates the fall hazard, OSHA is aware of certain problems that have been encountered with their application, use and design. (Ex. 1&hyph;140, 1&hyph;142, 1&hyph;143, 1&hyph;144). The Agency is working closely with those international standards setting organizations responsible for developing design and use specifications. In this rulemaking, OSHA solicits relevant information regarding the use of SATLs. Proposed 1918.85(j) addresses the hazards associated with working on the tops of containers. In keeping with OSHA's hierarchy of controlling hazards, this paragraph requires the use of feasible engineering controls. In proposed paragraph (j)(1) a definition for ``fall hazard'' is provided in a footnote. The definition seeks to narrow the elevated work surfaces where fall hazards exist in order to reflect the reality of a changing work surface. A longshore worker working on the top of containers for the purpose of loading or unloading a layer of containers is working on an elevated work surface that can increase or decrease at the rate of 320 square feet (29.4 m2) every few minutes. OSHA believes that such a rapidly changing elevated work surface is unique to this industry. For example, five 40-foot containers stowed side by side present a work surface of approximately 40 foot (12.2 m) by 40 foot (12.2 m) (1600 square feet)(147.2 m2). According to this definition, falling hazards (absent weather considerations) only exist within 3 feet (.92 m) of the perimeter or 3 feet (.9 m) by 148 feet (45.1 m) (444 square feet) (40.8 m2). By contrast, the hazardous area on top of a single container is 252 square feet (23.4 m2) of the 320 square feet (29.4 m2). The definition makes it clear that it is the unprotected edge where the hazard exists, and not necessarily the entire work surface. Additionally, any gap of 12 inches (.31 m) or more on a horizontal surface formed by containers is considered an unprotected edge and a falling hazard would exist under this definition. (For further discussion of the gap issue see 51 FR 42685 and 53 FR 48186). Finally, OSHA believes that any work within 3 feet (.92 m) of the unprotected edge constitutes a hazard (See Ex. 1&hyph;139). Another important element of this definition is the vertical distance necessary to constitute a fall hazard. OSHA believes that, in this industry and in this work operation, 10 feet (3.0 m) is the appropriate vertical distance. There are several considerations that leads OSHA to this conclusion. The height of the overwhelming majority of intermodal containers range from 8 feet (2.4 m) to 91/2 feet (2.7 m) (Ex. 1&hyph;139). Therefore, an employee working on top of a one-high container where the surface is less then 10 feet (3.04 m) would not, by definition, be exposed to a fall hazard. However, such containers are usually worked off ladders, not the top. Also, if such a container is stowed on a raised surface, such as a hatch cover or pedestal, that puts the top of the container at 10 feet or over, then any workers on top would, by definition, be exposed to fall hazards. The unique working surface in this operation coupled with heightened awareness of the longshore worker and the absence of accident data at this distance further assures OSHA that 10 foot is the appropriate height. OSHA is aware that an opposing view exists. Labor is of the opinion that OSHA should make this vertical height 8 feet (2.4 m) to be consistent with the proposed requirement 1918.32(b) where a fall hazard is considered to exist over 8 feet (2.4 m) when handling non-containerized cargo (Ex. 1&hyph;150). OSHA wishes to fully assess all factors attendant to this issue, and solicits all pertinent views and data on the appropriate height for fall protection. Two final considerations in the definition of a fall hazard are with regard to the elements and the ``adjoining surface.'' When weather conditions are such that the vision or footing of workers on top of containers is impaired then a fall hazard will, by definition, exist. The proposed standard requires such workers to be protected by fall protection, regardless of the fall distance or their proximity to the edge. OSHA notes that unsure footing on container top work surfaces created by oil or grease is addressed in the housekeeping section, 1918.91, of this proposed standard. In addition, in the Marine Terminal standard, OSHA defers to adverse weather conditions by prohibiting terminal crane operations in high-wind conditions (1917.45(g)). The other consideration involves the measurement of the vertical distance from ``the adjoining surface.'' Informal discussions between OSHA staff and various affected parties have indicated concern that this phrase must be carefully defined in order to avoid confusion in the maritime community. An enforcement concern is a that vertical height measurement might be made from the elevated surface to an adjoining surface which would not be the landing surface in the event of a fall. Should the term, ``adjoining surface'' be further clarified by adding either performance or specification language? For example, the term could read, ``adjoining landing surface (in the event of a fall)''; or ``adjoining surface with a minimum 8 by 8-foot area (2.4 m by 2.4 m).'' OSHA solicits comment on this issue. In view of the recent technological improvements in positive container securing devices indicated above, OSHA feels that many work operations, notably coning and deconing, that exposed workers to container top fall hazards can now be eliminated. As noted above, SATLs have proven to be particularly effective when container gantry cranes are utilized (Ex. 1&hyph;140). In fact, the use of these devices in these circumstances can, in most instances, eliminate the need for workers to go on top of containers. In light of this, three years after the date of publication of this proposal, proposed 1918.85(j)(1) would prohibit the performance of any work, notably coning and deconing, on top of containers that can be eliminated by the proper use of these devices. OSHA has estimated that over 25 percent of ships calling at U.S. ports already utilize SATLs (Ex. 2). Since it is OSHA's policy to allow a reasonable time to come into compliance with final standards, the proposed compliance date for the implementation of engineering controls would be three years. OSHA is optimistic that exposures to container top fall hazards will significantly decrease with the expanded deployment of positive container securing devices worldwide. At the same time, the Agency is sensitive to the magnitude of a phase-in process for SATLs. Consequently, OSHA is proposing a lengthy effective date of this section of three years from the date the proposed standard is issued. Consonant also with the Agency's policy, OSHA will continue to disseminate information to employers and employees in this industrial sector, as to how other operations throughout the nation and the world are approaching the problem. OSHA recognizes that positive container securing devices will not entirely eliminate the need for workers to go on the top of containers. Certain container placement or securing tasks, in addition to coning or deconing, must be performed. In these situations (e.g., securing bridge clamps or releasing jammed twistlocks), a comprehensive fall protection program must be implemented. Where cranes other than container gantry cranes are used to handle containers, OSHA recognizes that the use of SATLs may not be feasible. Precise placement capabilities of a container gantry crane are far superior to other lifting devices, thus facilitating the use of SATLs. This enhanced capability is due to the four point suspension system of the gantry crane, which provides greater stability and control of the container being handled, enabling the crane operator to place the container without assistance. Container operations where the spreader is suspended from a single point, on the other hand, have far less stability and control and typically requires the assistance of other employees in the placement of containers. In these circumstances, employees can frequently be exposed to fall hazards. In light of the discussion above, even when the use of SATLs is feasible when other than gantry cranes are being utilized, the need for employees to work on container tops in the handling of containers may not be eliminated. Therefore, OSHA would not require the use of positive container securing devices when containers are not being handled by container gantry cranes. Nonetheless, there is nothing in the proposed standard that would prohibit an employer from employing SATLs where a single point suspension is in use. However, under these circumstances, SATLs in the container being placed have been shown to jam or puncture the top of the container below with improper alignment (Ex. 1&hyph;140). OSHA solicits all pertinent views and information on all issues. With regard to the feasibility of fall protection, OSHA recognizes that, in this industry, there may be particular instances when even fall protection may not be feasible. An example of circumstances where fall protection may not be feasible is the placement of an overheight container on a chimney stow using gear that requires the manual release of hooks. In these situations the proposed standard requires the employer to: 1. Make a determination that an employee will be exposed to a fall hazard but that the use of fall protection is not feasible; 2. Alert the exposed employee about the hazards involved; and 3. Instruct the exposed employee how to best minimize the hazard. OSHA wishes to emphasize that such a situation is not common and that when they occur, the burden is on the employer to fully comply with these requirements prior to the actual exposure. In fact, the OSHA study indicated that a ``specific set of circumstances could not be framed'' where fall protection might not be feasible (Ex. 1&hyph;139, p. 1). Furthermore, situations that will be considered infeasible for fall protection will be narrowly construed in the enforcement context. A footnote in the standard refers to non-mandatory Appendix III which provides examples of situations where it may be considered infeasible to use fall protection. Where feasible, however, OSHA will require that fall protection be provided. Proposed 1918.85(k) establishes the technical requirements necessary to provide a fall protection system that is tailored to the handling of containers. Most of the requirements in this paragraph are basic to any occupationally related fall protection system. These include all of the paragraphs with the exception of (k)(7) and (k)(10), and are based on the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145), American National Standards Institute (ANSI) consensus standard Z359.1&hyph;1992 and the OSHA standards 1910.66 and 1926.104. Essentially, these requirements address the design, selection, care and proper use of a personal fall protection system. In addition, 1918.85(k)(7) and (10) have been specially crafted for the container top situation. Paragraph (k)(7) addresses the situation where a container gantry crane, or its extension, is being used as the anchorage point for the fall protection system in use. Under these circumstances, the crane must be placed in the slow speed mode and equipped with a remote shut-off switch in the control of the tied off employee. In addition, an indicator must be present to inform the employee when the remote is operational. OSHA seeks comment on whether the indicator should reflect that both the slow speed mode and the remote shut-off are operational. The other proposed requirement unique to this work operation, paragraph (k)(10), addresses the situation where the employee is being transported by a device, such as a safety cage, attached to a container gantry crane spreader. Such a device is required to have a means of attachment to the spreader in place in addition to the primary attachment mechanism of the spreader (hydraulic twistlock mechanism) to prevent accidental disengagement. OSHA is aware of several instances where accidental disengagement of a load has occurred (Ex. 1&hyph;25, 1&hyph;26). This secondary means of attachment is intended to minimize the potential for injury if accidental disengagement were to occur. A final issue for discussion in this section is Paragraph (k)(13) where an employee retrieval procedure in the case of a fall must be established. It has been suggested that local emergency response personnel be consulted in the development of this procedure in order to assure that rescue or retrieval efforts do not exacerbate any injury. OSHA believes that such a consultation would be prudent. OSHA invites comment on all issues related to container top safety and encourages the submission of relevant views and information. Proposed 1918.85(l) addresses container operations that require employees to work along unguarded edges other than on container tops. In these situations, fall protection meeting the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section must be provided where the fall distance is greater than 8 feet (2.4 m). This primarily addresses work operations such as lashing or locking and unlocking twist locks from other surfaces, or signalling to direct the placement of containers. Frequently, this work operation requires employees to work in elevated positions that remove the fall protection that would have normally been provided by the ship's coaming or railings. OSHA recently investigated a fatality where an employee fell 34 feet (10.3 m) from a lashing platform that was inadequately guarded (Ex. 1&hyph;149). Proposed 1918.86 is a new section that addresses operations aboard vessels that accommodate Ro-Ro (Roll-on/Roll-off) traffic. The emergence of Ro-Ro vessels is a fairly recent development and were not addressed in the current rules. Along with container operations, this section proposes new provisions that address advances in modern technology in the marine cargo handling industry. Examples of such vessels are car carriers, which facilitate the import and export automobile trades, and stern or side port combination carriers, which provide water carriage for wheel mounted as well as containerized cargo. Commonly such vessels are fitted with ramps that extend to the dock or wharf, and are fitted with ramps internally or, alternatively, are fitted with cargo elevators (lifts). In this manner, cargo is either driven through the vessel from deck to deck until reaching its final stowage location, or hoisted by cargo elevator to its proper deck and then driven to its final stowage location. Once positioned in its stowage location, the wheeled cargo is lashed to securing fittings that are provided on the deck. In such operations, lashing personnel are exposed to being struck by vehicular traffic. In addition, other workers involved with loading or unloading wheeled cargo, both drivers and pedestrians, are exposed to traffic hazards. OSHA is aware of a number of accidents (Ex. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89) that are attributable to this process, wherein employees are interspersed with vehicles in a closely confined, marginally illuminated and poorly traffic managed space. In proposed paragraph (a), OSHA would require an organized system of traffic control to be established and maintained at each entrance and exit ramp. The confluence of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in Ro-Ro operations, and thus the area where substantial accident potential is most pronounced, is the area on and around access ramps. With this mode of cargo carriage on the increase, accident potential is expected to increase proportionately. Ramps inside the vessel, although generally not as congested as ship-to-shore access lanes, must also be addressed by the traffic control system if they experience a periodic traffic flow that warrants such control. In developing this rule, OSHA considered positions taken by the International Labor Organization in their Code of Practice for Dock Work (Ex. 1&hyph;106), which provides that: A system of movement control of vehicles used in loading and unloading ships should be effectively and continuously applied. In assessing other national requirements, the Agency found that Sweden in its Dock Work Directions issued by the National Board of Occupational Safety and Health (Ex. 1&hyph;136), also requires that: A traffic guard shall be stationed wherever motor vehicles need to be directed, e.g., on roll on-roll off ramps, narrow wharves and places where there is traffic crossing and the view is limited. Clearly, shipside traffic control is just as necessary as it is in the shoreside environment. In OSHA's preamble to the Marine Terminals standard, the Agency emphasized (46 FR 4200) in its assessment of the importance of traffic control at the shoreside marine terminal setting: *&blank;*&blank;* the importance of these practices to employee safety cannot be over estimated. Given the close relationship between shoreside and shipboard vehicular utilization, it is appropriate that OSHA's rules addressing the two be complementary. Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the hazard of exceeding the capacity of the ramp used to transfer cargo. As a result of ramp failure, the likely injury to occur is drowning or being crushed in the vehicle. Ramps must be plainly marked with their load capacity and these capacities must not be exceeded (Ex. 1&hyph;5). Proposed paragraph (c) provides protection for employees that use the ship's ramp for access. In such situations, OSHA proposes that a physical separation, i.e., a barrier, be provided to separate the employee and the vehicles. Often vessels are fitted out in this manner (Ex. 1&hyph;84). However, should it be the case that a particular vessel is not so fitted, it is a matter that is easily rectified. When the design of the ramp prevents physical separation of pedestrians from vehicles, a signalperson shall direct traffic, and shall not allow concurrent use. Additionally, OSHA proposes to require that such ramps utilized for pedestrian access be fitted out in the same manner as would a traditional pedestrian gangway (see 1918.21). Proposed paragraph (d) requires that ramps be properly maintained and secured. This is consistent with 1918.24(b) which addresses maintaining and securing portable ramps. Proposed paragraph (e) recognizes that in many of the modern generations of Ro-Ro vessels, internal ramps are elevatable. Such a construction feature allows for multiple access destinations, depending upon the placement of the ramp. If a ramp is placed in such a manner as to allow access to a given deck, thereby creating a void in another access route (that could perhaps lead to a substantial drop or fall), this paragraph provides that the incomplete route be clearly identified and barricaded. OSHA has investigated at least one (Ex. 1&hyph;86) occupational fatality in which this circumstance was apparent. Paragraph (f) requires that all brake air lines be connected and tested prior to commencing operations. The proper operation of brakes is necessary when operating inside a Ro-Ro vessel that typically has ramps with steep grades. Proposed paragraph (g) requires that flat bed and low boy trailers be marked with their cargo capacity and not be overloaded. These operations typically employ the use of trailers not designed for over-the-road use such as low boy trailers (sometimes referred to as ``mafi's'') that allow access to low deck height spaces found in Ro-Ro vessels. Proposed paragraph (h) is analogous to OSHA's current weight requirement for intermodal containers. It would require that cargo to be handled via the ship's ramp be either marked with its weight or have such weight clearly marked in a written record. As a practical matter, vessel stow plans most always contain such data. Proposed paragraph (i) requires tractors to have sufficient power and braking capacity to safely operate on Ro-Ro vessels. As previously noted, this is especially important in negotiating tight spaces and steep grades on Ro-Ro vessels. Proposed paragraph (k) would require that internal combustion engine vehicles only be operated when adequate ventilation exists or is provided. It also provides guidance in determining acceptable levels of air contaminants generated by the internal combustion process, by referring the reader to the appropriate section of this part and part 1910, subpart Z (which is referenced in subpart A of this proposal. In most situations, the vessels themselves are fitted out with ventilation systems at all decks. It has been the Agency's observation that a number of purpose built Ro-Ro vessels possess ventilation systems that function remarkably well (Ex. 1&hyph;72), monitoring ambient air for various air contaminants as well as explosive properties. Proposed paragraph (l) would require that cargo be secured to prevent sliding loads. This addresses the specific hazard of cargo falling off trailers while in transit on Ro-Ro vessels. Proposed paragraph (m) would require that authorized persons, equipped with high visibility vests (or equivalent protection), be the only employees permitted on any deck where Ro-Ro operations are being conducted. Requiring only high visibility vests (or equivalent protection) and eliminating the allowance of using decals or reflectors is a departure from what has been allowed in the Marine Terminal standard. As is noted in Section VI of this preamble, OSHA proposes to eliminate the allowance of decals or reflectors in 1917.71(e) because of problems experienced with the use of decals, reflectors, and similar items. The reflective area of a decal on a hard hat is obviously less than that of a vest. Also, the reflective value is lost during daylight hours or whenever the wearer takes off the hard hat. A number of serious accidents (Exs. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89) have occurred in the past due to the nature of the work involved in such cargo operations. This paragraph, along with the signalling requirements in proposed paragraph (n) that follow, are expected to enable employers to avoid vehicle-related accidents onboard ships. Paragraph (n) addresses signalling requirements for maneuvering vehicles into stowage positions while other personnel are in the adjacent vicinity. In proposed 1918.87, OSHA sets out requirements for the utilization of shipboard elevators (lifts). Elevators are most common on a number of different Ro-Ro and Combination carrier vessel designs. The hazards addressed by this section are cargo falling from an improperly loaded elevator; and from wheeled cargo or employees falling into open spaces in the deck created by a moving elevator. In approaching the issue of elevator usage, the Agency remained mindful of foreign vessel design prerogatives. Consequently, the four paragraphs proposed within this section, are protective of U.S. longshore workers obliged to use such installations, but are not expected to have an impact on any other nation's vessel designs. In summarizing this section, OSHA would require that safe working loads of elevators be determined and adhered to. As a ``lifting appliance,'' shipboard elevators are part of a complement of gear that comes under considerable discussion in ILO Convention No. 152 (see discussion of Subpart B_Gear Certification). As such, shipboard installations of elevators will require certification of safe working loads as well as the posting of elevator capacity. In practical terms, the employer's responsibility with regard to this paragraph is relatively simple to discharge. The requirement for evenly distributing the weight(s) to be lifted, particularly when considering the various drive mechanisms providing power to the elevator platforms, is an important provision. Proposed paragraph (c) also is an important requirement that, while allowing the driver of a vehicle to remain at the vehicle's controls, prohibits other persons from riding the elevator to other decks. Of necessity, the sides of many shipboard elevators are unguarded while in transit. Riders, therefore, would be exposed to falls from sometimes significant heights. The ILO's Code of Practice for Dock Work (Ex. 1&hyph;107) addresses this issue in much the same manner. In proposed paragraph (d), OSHA addresses a problem that both this Agency and the earlier Labor Standards Bureau have recognize as needing attention (Ex. 1&hyph;82). This provision would require that if fall hazards are created by open decks during the operation of shipboard elevators, the decks shall be barricaded. OSHA believes that under current international practice most installations will already be effectively guarded. In those situations, however, where the installation falls short in providing this safeguard, the employer must take the initiative in acquiring and effectively utilizing the required barrier protection. Proposed 1918.88, ``Log operations,'' as previously mentioned in the preamble discussion of proposed 1918.38 ``Log rafts,'' is also an entirely new section addressing the hazards associated with loading logs from the water into a vessel. This is a particularly hazardous operation both because of the location where it occurs (on the water) and the nature of the cargo. Logs that are loaded from the water usually have been in the water for a long period of time, causing them to absorb water. The extra water adds to their weight and also loosens the bark, making the log surface very unsure and slippery. The proposed provisions of this section have been taken from both existing longshore regulations and from the ILWU-PMA Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC) (Ex. 1&hyph;145). In addition, these new requirements are supported by record evidence developed by OSHA personnel in Region 10 (Ex. 1&hyph;146). Proposed paragraph (a) is taken from PCMSC Rule 417 (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and addresses the hazards associated with unstable logs that could be in the hold of a vessel creating a situation where employees could be injured or killed should the logs shift. Employees must not be in spaces in the hold when and where logs being loaded could strike them. Proposed paragraph (b) addresses the hazard associated with the physical condition of the log surface, which may be slippery if there is no bark, or otherwise hazardous if the bark is loose and slides off the log as the employee is stepping on it. Employers must provide appropriate footwear to employees that have to climb on the log. Such footwear typically are spiked, also known as ``caulked'' shoes, may be styled like a sandal that attaches to existing footwear, and specifically designed for working logs (Ex. 1&hyph;146, pp.13&hyph;14). Proposed paragraph (c), which is taken from the current longshore 1918.96(f), requires that lifelines be furnished and hung over the side when working log booms or cribs. Proposed paragraph (d) is also taken from the current longshore regulation 1918.23(c), and requires that a Jacob's ladder be provided for each gang when working a log boom. However, in accordance with the provision in proposed 1918.23(c), no more than two Jacob's ladders are required for each log boom being worked. Proposed paragraph (e) has also been taken from the current longshore regulations, 1918.96(e), and requires that a U.S. Coast Guard approved life ring with at least 90 feet (27.4 m) of line be in the vicinity of the work area. The final paragraph, (f), requires that a rescue boat be available when employees are working on log rafts or booms. This requirement is similar to that found in Rule 638 of the PCMSC (Ex. 1&hyph;145). This addresses the hazard of employees falling into the water while loading logs and being carried away by the river current and possibly drowning. The requirement of a rescue boat would allow an employee who falls into the water to be quickly rescued. Much of the proposed language in this section is based on rules found in the Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (PCMSC) (Ex. 1&hyph;145), which has been negotiated by the Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. In addition, OSHA believes that the proposed requirements reflect the current safe industry practice. OSHA requests comment from the public concerning the completeness of these proposed regulations pertaining to handling logs from the water. Proposed 1918.89, addressing hazardous cargo, is carried over from the existing Longshore standard (1918.86). The same language is found addressing this issue when at shoreside cargo handling operations (1917.22). Proposed 1918.89 and the Hazard Communication rule that is referenced in the ``Scope and Applicability'' paragraph, 1918.1(b)(6), complement one another in covering employee notification and procedures for handling hazardous cargo. OSHA requests comment from the public on whether 1918.89(a) and (c), and similar language in 1917.22(a) and (c) is repetitious in light of the Hazard Communication rule, keeping in mind that HazCom is referenced in both Parts. (In addition, the exposure of employees to toxic and hazardous substances is addressed in subpart B of part 1917, in proposed subpart I of part 1918 and in subpart Z of part 1910.) Subpart I_General Working Conditions In 1987, OSHA extended the coverage of the Hazard Communication standard (HazCom) (29 CFR 1910.1200) to all employers with employees exposed to hazardous chemicals in their workplaces. As a result, subpart I of part 1918 was amended to include the requirements of that standard as 1918.90. Basically the HazCom standard requires such employers to provide information to their employees concerning hazardous chemicals by means of hazard communication programs. These programs would include the use of labels, material safety data sheets (MSDS), training and access to written records. In addition, distributors of hazardous chemicals are required to ensure that containers they distribute are properly labeled, and that a material safety data sheet is provided to their customers. On August 24, 1987, OSHA, in expanding the coverage of this rule, also made certain revisions that address the handling of sealed containers of hazardous materials, such as is usually done in longshoring work. Specifically, OSHA stated at 52 FR 31861: There are a number of work situations where employees only handle sealed containers of chemicals, and under normal conditions of use would not open the containers and would not expect to experience any measurable exposure to the chemicals. Such work operations include, for example, warehousing, retail sales, marine cargo handling, and trucking terminals. (Emphasis added.) OSHA recognized, nonetheless, that even under these circumstances, the potential for a hazardous exposure could occur. It is reasonable to assume, however, that all such containers are subject to leakage and breakage, and these employees are in fact potentially exposed by virtue of the presence of these hazardous chemicals in their workplaces. Because of this potential exposure, they need information to protect themselves form the hazards of these chemicals in the event such an emergency situation occurs. (Id.) Proposed 1918.90 consists solely of a cross-reference to the Scope and Applicability section of the proposal, specifically 1918.1(b)(6), which references the Hazardous Communication standard, 1910.1200. OSHA has decided to reference the Hazard Communication standard in the scope section of this proposal as one of the part 1910 provisions applicable to longshoring. This would have no effect on either the enforceability or the applicability of HazCom to longshoring. OSHA proposes to do the same in the Marine Terminals standard (part 1917). The primary HazCom obligations that apply to longshoring are found in 1910.1200(b)(4). This paragraph sets out the basic duties of employers: (1) not to remove or deface labels affixed to containers of hazardous chemicals; (2) to maintain and provide access to any MSDS's that are received for hazardous chemicals while the chemicals are in the workplace; and (3) to obtain an MSDS when one is not received but an employee requests one. In addition, the employer must train employees in accordance with the provisions of the rule to ensure they are protected in the event of a spill or leak. The Agency seeks comment on this different approach. Proposed 1918.91 addresses housekeeping. In assessing the types of accidents that most occur in shipboard cargo handling, one fact has remained constant: many involve slips, trips, and falls (Exs. 1&hyph;14, 1&hyph;73). Housekeeping factors cause a substantial number of such accidents. Staying with the principle of providing a uniform regulatory approach to shipboard and shoreside occupational safety and health, OSHA proposes, in this section, to bring into part 1918 those applicable provisions of part 1917 that cover the same hazards on shore. Those remaining provisions, which are vessel-specific, would be retained from the current part 1918. In addition, OSHA considers lashing gear that is used with containers, roll-on, roll-off cargo, and, in particular, automobiles, to be ``equipment,'' as referred to in paragraph (a). Proposed 1918.92 provides illumination requirements for cargo handling work aboard vessels. Here again, OSHA remains consistent with its shoreside rules in requiring 5 footcandles (average) (54 lux) of illumination at cargo operations. In proposing this standard, OSHA believes that it will not only remain uniform with its shoreside rule (1917.123), but also remain consistent with good illumination safety principles. (Ex. 1&hyph;152) In crossing from one location to another, in this case shore to ship, it is a well-recognized safety practice to provide uniform lighting. On this topic, the American National Standard practice for Industrial Illumination (ANSI/IES RP&hyph;7&hyph;1991) (Ex. 1&hyph;152) states the following: Alternate areas of extreme luminance differences are undesirable because it tires the eyes to adjust to them. .... uniformity permits flexibility of functions and equipment and assures more uniform luminances. Proposed paragraph (c) would require that lighting provided aboard ship does not shine into the eyes of personnel in key positions of cargo control, such as crane and winch operators. Certainly it is extremely important to allow a clear and unencumbered view to those that are in control of the cargo transit. With the same principle in mind, it would also be required that stationary lights (those not mounted on vehicles) on Ro-Ro vessels not shine into the eyes of drivers. In addition, the proposed requirements for portable lights and entry into dark areas closely parallel the provisions in the existing standard. Proposed 1918.93, Hazardous atmospheres and substances, is designed to provide protection from atmospheric hazards which are not specifically addressed in other proposed sections. In as much as these hazards are virtually identical to those found in marine terminals, the language of this section largely tracks the requirements found in 1917.23. Since the promulgation of the Marine Terminal standard, OSHA has promulgated a Permit-Required Confined Spaces standard for General Industry (58 FR 4462, Jan. 14, 1993). Since both the Marine Terminal and Longshoring standards currently addressed hazards associated with confined spaces, OSHA did not intend the General Industry standard to apply to these workplaces. However, OSHA also had planned, in its ongoing development of this longshore proposal, to conform the relevant longshore requirements to the more explicit and protective marine terminal requirements. Furthermore, this approach is consistent with the vertical nature of these maritime standards. The use of the phrase ``the employer is aware'' that a hazardous condition exists means that the employer is or should be aware of the hazardous condition. This section establishes requirements for the determination of the hazard, the testing during ventilation, and the procedures for entry into hazardous atmospheres. In addition, the hazards associated with emergency entry, inadvertent entry and asbestos spills are also addressed. Proposed 1918.94 provides requirements for ventilation and atmospheric workplace conditions. Proposed paragraph (a) specifically addresses the hazards associated with carbon monoxide (CO) aboard ship. Longshoring work frequently involves the use of internal combustion-powered equipment to facilitate the stowage and removal of cargo. This equipment would include fork lift trucks, bulk cargo movers and the cargo itself (vehicles on Ro-Ro ships). Occupational fatalities and disabling illnesses still appear on the waterfront (Exs. 1&hyph;76, 1&hyph;77, and 1&hyph;81) due to high levels of (CO) accumulating from these sources in cargo spaces. Currently OSHA's limit for (CO) in General Industry, Construction, and Shipyards is 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The limits in Marine Terminals and Longshoring are a 50 ppm and, in confined spaces, a 100 ppm ceiling. The ACGIH&hyph;1986 has a TLV \u00ae -TWA of 50 ppm and a TLV \u00ae -STEL of 400 ppm for (CO) (Ex. 3&hyph;8). NIOSH (Ex. 3&hyph;1) recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 35 ppm and a 200 ppm ceiling. For both Longshoring and Marine Terminals, OSHA is proposing to lower the PELs for CO to 35 ppm (8-hour TWA) and is proposing a 200 ppm (ceiling, measured over 5 minutes) in outdoor, non-enclosed spaces. OSHA is proposing to retain the 100 ppm ceiling for CO in enclosed spaces in Marine Terminals and Longshoring. NIOSH concurs (Ex. 3&hyph;2) that the proposed limits are appropriate. Carbon monoxide is a flammable, colorless, practically odorless gas. It is used as a reducing agent in metallurgical operations, in the manufacture of metal carbonyls and zinc-based white pigments, and as a chemical intermediate. Most occupational exposures to this ubiquitous substance are the result of the incomplete combustion of organic material (HSDB 1990; Ex. 3&hyph;18). Carbon monoxide has caused a large number of industrial fatalities as a result of its tendency to combine readily with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). The Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) level for carbon monoxide is 1500 ppm (Ex. 3&hyph;3). At levels above this, workers quickly lose consciousness; if exposure is not terminated immediately, death by asphyxiation follows quickly. In experimental animals, asphyxiation occurs when the air-borne concentration of CO exceeds 3 percent (30,000 ppm) (HSDB 1990). CO also causes reproductive and developmental effects in animals. The LD in rats is 1807 ppm for 4 hours (Ex. 3&hyph;4). Excessive accumulations of COHb cause hypoxic stress in healthy individuals as a result of the reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. In patients with cardiovascular disease, such stress can further impair cardiovascular function. A number of studies show that 8-hour TWA exposures to 50 ppm carbon monoxide generally results in COHb levels of 8 to 10 percent. Such levels are not generally associated with overt signs or symptoms of health impairment in healthy individuals with strong cardiovascular systems who are working under nonstressful conditions. However, the ACGIH believes that a TLV \u00ae -TWA of 25 ppm, which results in COHb levels of 4 percent or less, may be necessary to protect workers with cardiovascular disease, because this condition places workers at higher risk of serious cardiovascular injury (Ex. 3&hyph;8, p. 1106). The NIOSH REL of 35 ppm TWA is also aimed at protecting workers with chronic heart disease (CHD); NIOSH believes that such workers should not be allowed to have carboxyhemoglobin levels that approach 5 percent. In the part 1910 air contaminants rulemaking, several commenters questioned the need to lower the 8-hour TWA and to add a STEL. In response to these commenters, OSHA quoted the ACGIH (Id.): Each molecule of CO combining with hemoglobin reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and exerts a finite stress on man. Thus, it may be reasoned that there is no dose of CO that is not without an effect on the body. Whether that effect is physiologic or harmful depends upon the dose of CO and the state of health of the exposed individual . The body compensates for this hypoxic stress by increasing cardiac output and blood flow to specific organs, such as the brain or the heart. When this ability to compensate is overpowered or is limited by disease, tissue injury results [emphasis added]. Exposure to CO sufficient to produce COHb saturations in the 3-5% range impairs cardiovascular function in patients with cardiovascular disease and in normal subjects. *&blank;*&blank;* The primary effect of exposure to low concentrations of CO on workmen results from the hypoxic stress secondary to the reduction in the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. *&blank;*&blank;* Workmen with significant disease, both detected and undetected, may not be able to compensate adequately and are at risk of serious injury. For such workers, a TLV of 25 ppm *&blank;*&blank;* might be necessary. Even such a concentration might be detrimental to the health of some workers who might have far advanced cardiovascular disease. *&blank;*&blank;* It would appear to the Committee that the time-weighted TLV of 50 ppm for carbon monoxide might also be too high under conditions of heavy labor, high temperatures, or at high elevations (Ex. 3&hyph;8). Thus, the ACGIH also regards a lower limit for CO as necessary to protect workers with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or those working under stressful conditions. OSHA believes that it is clearly necessary to set a CO level that protects workers who have CHD because (1) a large percentage of employees have it, (2) it is often not diagnosed or diagnosable, and (3) it is frequently fatal. The 35 ppm 8-hour TWA is designed to protect employees with asymptomatic CHD. The term CHD is generally used to refer to the process of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, which leads to disturbances in the myocardial blood supply. The general worker population in the United States is composed of a very significant number of persons with CHD. Since the identification of such persons in the absence of overt clinical symptoms is virtually impossible, it is necessary to assume that the average worker has asymptomatic CHD, especially when his/her first clinical symptom may be sudden death (Ex. 3&hyph;1). Several studies demonstrate the significant risk associated with CO exposure, particularly with respect to coronary heart disease. A study of firefighters in Los Angeles (Ex. 3&hyph;10) suggests that CO exposure during firefighting may be responsible for the high incidence of heart disease in firefighters. In some fires, peak exposures were occasionally as high as 3000 ppm CO, with 40 percent of peak values in the 100-to 500-ppm CO range. However, in some fires, the peak CO exposure was below 100 ppm. Although these peak exposures in firefighters were high, firefighters are likely to be exposed overall for fewer hours than the workers of concern in this rulemaking. A prevalence study was recently performed on angina pectoris, ECG changes, and blood pressure that involved 1,000 workers from 20 foundries (Ex. 3&hyph;11). A clear dose-response was found with regard to the prevalence of angina (as obtained by history on a World Health Organization-recommended questionnaire) and CO exposure in workers (both smokers and nonsmokers). NIOSH conducted a prospective cohort mortality study among 1,558 white male motor vehicle examiners who were employed in New Jersey for a minimum of 6 months between 1944 and 1973 (Ex. 3&hyph;12). Industrial hygiene surveys indicated that the examiners were exposed to carbon monoxide at a time-weighted-average (TWA) of 10 to 24 ppm. Using a modified life table technique, the expected deaths were compared to the expected deaths through August 1973. The overall deficit of mortality observed (SMR180) in this occupational cohort during the first 10-year period was to be expected as a result of the widely accepted ``healthy worker effect.'' However, the component SMR for cardiovascular disease deaths (134) was unexpected, since the ``healthy worker effect'' had been most significantly associated with decreased cardiovascular disease mortality (Ex. 3&hyph;13). This evidence suggests that slightly elevated COHb may contribute to excess cardiovascular disease rates in a healthy population that is of average fitness (since the work is not physically hard). A recent study (Ex. 3&hyph;14) reviewed the epidemiological evidence for an association between carbon monoxide and heart disease and concluded that carbon monoxide exerts acute and possibly reversible short-term effects that can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. In another recent study, male volunteers aged 35 to 75 with stable exertional angina pectoris and positive exercise treadmill tests were exposed to CO concentrations designed to cause 2.2 to 4.4 percent COHb levels after exercise. The subjects performed a symptom-limited exercise test on a treadmill, followed by exposure for 1 hour to CO, and then performed a second treadmill test. All subjects who completed the study (N=63) showed significant decreases in time to onset of ischemic ST-segment changes; in the 2 percent COHb group, this change equalled 5.1 percent, and in the 4 percent COHb group it averaged a 12.1 percent decrease (Allred, Bleecher, Chaitman, Dahms, Gottlieb, Hackney et al. 1989, in Res. Rep. Hlth. Effect. Inst. 25:79). As pointed out above, cardiovascular disease (detected or undetected) and pulmonary impairment are widespread in the general population in this country, in workers as well as other sub-populations. In addition, OSHA is particularly concerned about the adverse effects of CO because workers regularly encounter complex and stressful situations at work, including heat stress, jobs demanding heavy exertion, and tasks requiring both judgment and motor coordination. OSHA standards are intended to protect workers of average and below-average fitness and those who engage only intermittently in heavy physical labor and who do not therefore receive the benefit of physical conditioning. OSHA thus has determined that, in Longshoring and Marine Terminals, the proposed 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm for carbon monoxide is needed to reduce the significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease that is associated with overexposure to CO. The Agency also believes that a ceiling of 200 ppm in outdoors, non-enclosed spaces is necessary to ensure that peak CO exposures are kept below the 1500 ppm IDLH level by a reasonable safety factor. The ceiling limit will also assist in keeping COHb levels below 5 percent; the ceiling will be measured over 5 minutes to permit the use of simpler monitoring techniques. Based on this evidence, OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm and a ceiling of 200 ppm in outdoor, non-enclosed spaces as the PELs for carbon monoxide in the longshoring and marine terminal industries. In these industries, however, most employees regularly enter and work in a compartment, hold, or other enclosed space, in which CO levels can increase rapidly if uncontrolled. CO, therefore, presents an especially great danger of death from IDLH levels of CO. Consequently, OSHA is retaining the 100 ppm ceiling for CO in such spaces, as well as the provision requiring monitoring of these spaces. The Agency would continue to require that the employer monitor the ambient air within any cargo space where internal combustion engines discharge their exhaust. Therefore, when concentrations of CO in these enclosed spaces reach 100 ppm, work shall be suspended and the workers removed from the spaces. Work shall not resume until concentrations of CO, as determined by actual monitoring, have been reduced to within the allowable limits. The Agency believes that these limits will ensure that the COHb levels of exposed workers (especially of non-smokers) in these sectors are maintained at or below 5 percent, which will protect those workers at greater risk because of cardiovascular or pulmonary impairment. In addition, these revised limits will protect healthy workers in the affected sectors who must work in environments involving intermittent exertion, heat stress, or other strenuous conditions. OSHA believes that these limits are necessary to substantially reduce the significant occupational risk associated with both chronic and peak exposures to carbon monoxide in the workplace. The hypoxic stress associated with exposure to carbon monoxide clearly constitutes a material impairment of health and functional capacity. For a more complete discussion of these health effects see 57 FR 26371. If natural or vessel supplied ventilation is not sufficient to maintain levels within the allowable limits, the employer must utilize supplemental methods until such levels are reached (generally accomplished with portable blowers). It should be noted that the proposed requirement deletes the language ``before work is resumed.'' This is to make the requirement reflect more clearly the actual industry practices being employed to control exposure to CO through the use of engineering controls. The longshoring work itself generates CO through the use of the loading equipment. In reality, then, it is not the circumstance that 100 ppm is routinely reached, the hold is cleared of workers, supplemental blowers are used to clear the air and then the workers return to work. Rather, when a sustained build-up of CO is detected, even at much lower levels, the supplemental blowers or other additional means are employed to maintain the exposures to within the allowable limits. Portable ventilating equipment must be guarded to prevent employee injury, and they must be effectively grounded by a grounding conductor run with or enclosing the circuit conductors. In situations where portable ventilating equipment is run by vessel supplied power, the grounding conductor must be bonded to the structure of the vessel. Given the shipboard environment, careful attention must be paid to the electric cords of portable equipment, making certain they are not worn or otherwise unserviceable. OSHA is proposing to retain the requirement for recording tests of the atmosphere. The stevedoring community is successfully using such testing logs as a frame of reference in assessing atmospheric conditions from one point in time to the next. In proposed paragraph (b), OSHA addresses the longshoring hazards associated with handling grain that has been treated with fumigants. Grain is subject to infestation by insects and rodents during storage and shipping. Fumigants used to control infestation can be liquid or solid compounds that release poisonous gases and can be applied in the form of sprays, fogs or gases or by direct contact (Ex. 1&hyph;104). *&blank;*&blank;* these gases are harmful, possibly fatal, to humans as long as they remain potent. Therefore, they constitute a safety hazard from the time of application throughout the duration of their potency_which may last for several days. (Id. p.36). Here, OSHA would require that the employer determine whether or not grain to be loaded or discharged aboard a vessel had been fumigated. Such a determination shall be based on direct communication with knowledgeable persons from both the grain elevator and the vessel. When a cargo has been fumigated, an employer shall designate a person (see 1918.2(c)), who is thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of the fumigant being used and how to properly assess contaminant levels; fully aware of the manufacturer of the fumigant's use recommendations and warnings; and knowledgeable about the proper personal protective equipment which must be worn to safely guard against the possible effects of the fumigant. The designated person must test the vessel's compartments after loading begins, but before longshore employees (generally trimmers) enter. Subsequent tests must be made to ensure that fumigant concentrations to exposed personnel never attain levels that are beyond the allowable limits. Records of those tests are retained by the employer for a period of 30 days. Whenever the concentration in any compartment reaches the level specified as hazardous by the fumigant manufacturer or by subpart Z of 29 CFR part 1910, whichever is lower, all employees shall be removed from such compartments and shall not be permitted to re-enter until such time as tests demonstrate that the atmosphere is within allowable limits. Consistent with 1917.25 of the Marine Terminal standard, during emergencies or while tests are being undertaken in compartments that have hazardous or unknown concentrations of fumigant, the designated person entering the compartment must be properly outfitted with personal protective equipment, (See criteria at proposed 1918.94(b)(3)(v)), and must be observed while conducting such tests by two standby employees, who are themselves properly outfitted. The personal protective equipment used by the designated person and the observers, will be required to be readily available wherever fumigated grains are handled. In situations where it is necessary to carry out insecticide or pesticide treatment of a localized nature, such as in rodent control, paragraph (b)(4) would require that employees conducting the treatment and those that may be exposed to the chemical(s) applied, be equipped with personal protective equipment that meets the specifications set out by the manufacturer of the chemical(s) being used. In proposing these rules covering fumigated grain cargoes, the Agency has relied upon the existing rule for longshore employment (Ex. 1&hyph;39) but has also utilized the Agency's experience in promulgating the general industry Permit-required Confined Space standard (29 CFR 1910.146, 58 FR 4549), together with accident data (Ex. 1&hyph;104) relating to fumigated grain cargoes aboard ship. Finally, these rules are further supported by similar provisions found in the Pacific Coast Marine Safety Code (Ex. 1&hyph;145) and the U.S. Coast Guard's ``Interim Regulations for Shipboard Fumigation,'' 46 CFR&hyph;147A (Ex. 1&hyph;105). In proposed paragraph (c), the Agency proposes requirements for handling cargoes of fumigated tobacco. Tobacco cargoes, both ported and exported, are shipped most typically in bales, in hogsheads, and in intermodal containers. OSHA's proposed Longshoring requirements apply when cargoes are break-bulk, i.e., piece lots of bales or in hogsheads. When such cargoes are containerized, OSHA addresses employee exposure in the Marine Terminal standard (29 CFR 1917.25(g)). In the case of break-bulk fumigated tobacco cargoes, the employer would be required to determine (by written notification) if the cargo has in fact been fumigated. If so, the employer would be further required to obtain a written warranty from the fumigator(s) that the cargo has been sufficiently aerated (concentration of fumigant is within allowable limits.) OSHA notes that this practice is currently in place at all longshore operations in the U.S. handling tobacco. In the case of containerized shipments of fumigated tobacco, OSHA is proposing new language that can be found in the proposed changes to the Marine Terminal regulations, 1917.25(g), which is part of this proposal and which is discussed in Section VI of this rulemaking. Proposed paragraphs (d) and (e) remain virtually identical to the existing provisions. Paragraph (d) involves a work practice to discover hazardous exposures to fumigants of any cargo other than grain and tobacco while paragraph (e) involves the use of personal protective equipment to protect against heavy concentrations of dust. Proposed paragraph (f) addresses operations aboard vessels engaged in the menhaden trade. Menhaden is a term that refers to several species of trash fish. Menhaden is used to produce, among other products, fertilizer, pet food and fish oil. (See 46 FR 4213.) As cargo to specialized menhaden marine terminals, menhaden presents a health hazard to longshore workers when it decomposes, generating hydrogen sulfide (H S). As recently as 1987, a hydrogen sulfide incident aboard a menhaden vessel led to serious injury and a fatality (Ex. 1&hyph;80). OSHA's current limit for hydrogen sulfide in Marine Terminals is 20 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; the current Longshore standard is silent with regard to both H 2S and menhaden. The 1986 ACGIH TLV \u00ae s for hydrogen sulfide are 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 15 ppm as a 15 minute STEL (Ex. 3&hyph;8); NIOSH has a 10-ppm, 10-minute REL for this substance (Ex. 3&hyph;3). OSHA is proposing an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm in Longshoring and Marine Terminals with a STEL of 15 ppm. Promulgation of these PELs will make OSHA's limits for hydrogen sulfide consistent with the best available evidence on the hazards of H S exposure. Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless, flammable gas with the odor of rotten eggs. It is widely used as a chemical intermediate, an analytical reagent, and in the manufacture of ``heavy water'' (H O ) in the utilities sector. In agriculture, it is used as a disinfectant (HSDB 1985). It is also generated by the fermentation of animal manure. Many farm workers have been exposed to this substance while working in the vicinity of liquid manure storage pits and have been asphyxiated as a consequence (Ex. 4&hyph;1). Hydrogen sulfide also is encountered in natural oil and gas deposits and in sewers, caissons, tunnels, and other construction sites (Grant 1986, p. 495). When used in pesticidal applications and as directed on the label, this substance is regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). In longshoring, the hazard is brought about by the generation of hydrogen sulfide gas, caused by the decomposition of the menhaden (and similar species) catch. Hydrogen sulfide's effects on experimental animals are similar to those seen in exposed workers: conjunctivitis, pulmonary irritation, acute poisoning, and death by chemical asphyxiation (Ex. 4&hyph;2). The LD in mice is 673 ppm for 1 hour (Ex. 4&hyph;3). A number of experiments have demonstrated that exposure to hydrogen sulfide concentrations of 50 to 100 ppm for several hours (or sometimes longer) causes damage to the corneal epithelium of dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs; animals are believed to be somewhat less sensitive than humans to hydrogen sulfide's ocular effects but may be more sensitive to its pulmonary effects (Grant 1986, p. 1496). When inhaled at concentrations exceeding 500 ppm, exposure to hydrogen sulfide has caused respiratory paralysis and death. Acutely poisoned individuals who recover may experience headaches, fatigue, dizziness, and nystagmus; eventually, however, recovery is usually complete (Ex. 4&hyph;4). The 1986 ACGIH Documentation (Ex. 1-3, p. 1318) cites several reports (Ex. 4&hyph;6) of the occurrence of adverse ocular effects, including conjunctivitis, caused by exposure to 20 ppm or less of hydrogen sulfide. A study by Poda and Aiken (Ex. 4&hyph;7) reports that the adoption of a voluntary limit of 10 ppm in two heavy-water plants eliminated exposure problems at those facilities. An early study by Flury and Zernik (1931f) reports that the conjunctivitis caused by the exposure of volunteers to 10 to 15 ppm of hydrogen sulfide for six hours endured for several days; however, this substance is not known to have caused irreversible eye damage. The author of the best-known general source on the toxicology of the eye (Grant 1986) states that ``where the concentration [of hydrogen sulfide] is regularly kept below 10 ppm in air, it is rare to have any irritation of the eyes'' (p. 1496). OSHA believes that the proposed STEL will ensure that concentrations are maintained close to the 8-hour TWA and that excursions above irritant levels are thus minimized. Based on this evidence, OSHA believes that the current 10-ppm 8-hour TWA limit alone does not adequately protect workers in Longshoring and Marine Terminals against the adverse ocular effects associated with exposure to concentrations of hydrogen sulfide above 10 ppm. OSHA believes that the eye irritation and conjunctivitis associated with such exposures represent a significant risk of material health impairment to these workers because they may experience pain and other ocular effects and be forced to seek medical treatment after such exposures. OSHA is accordingly proposing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 ppm for hydrogen sulfide with a short-term limit of 15 ppm in these parts 1917 and 1918. Based on available information, the Agency has determined that these limits are necessary to provide protection from the significant risk of exposure-related ocular effects, including conjunctivitis, corneal edema, and distortion of vision, associated with occupational exposure to hydrogen sulfide. Since the hazard this paragraph seeks to avoid is brought about by the generation of hydrogen sulfide gas, caused by the decomposition of the menhaden (and similar species) catch, the requirements are not applicable to operations aboard vessels with operable refrigerated compartments used to hold the catch. Paragraph (f) requires that tests be performed before and during discharge, by designated personnel who are trained and competent in their understanding of the potential hazards involved within the catch hold(s). The test would include assessments of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen content of the atmosphere(s) within the hold(s). Employers would be prohibited from sending employees into the hold(s) unless the hydrogen sulfide level was kept below 10 parts per million on a time weighted average with a short term exposure limit of 15 ppm measured over a 15 minute sampling period. Oxygen levels must be maintained to at least 19.5 percent. In arriving at these proposed requirements, OSHA utilizes information that supported similar requirements for the shoreside aspect of menhaden operations in the Agency's rules for Marine Terminals (1917.73; See discussion at 46 FR 4213). Also, in the development of the proposed requirements, the National Fish Meal & Oil Association was clearly supportive of the proposed regulatory posture. In communications between that group and the Department of Labor, and in memoranda to the association's membership (Ex. 1&hyph;56), it is clear that industry practice is quite consistent with OSHA's proposal. Proposed 1918.95 contains requirements for sanitary considerations at all longshoring operations. OSHA believes that the hazards associated with poor sanitation and sanitary practices are well established and need not be elaborated here. The proposed provisions are fully consistent with the current regulations for shoreside cargo handling (1917.127), providing the uniformity that is necessary between the two segments of marine cargo handling. OSHA is proposing in both 1917.127 and 1918.95 to include tables which specify the number of toilet facilities according to the number of employees at the worksite. This table has been taken from the sanitation section in OSHA's Construction Safety Regulations, 29 CFR 1926.51(c). OSHA requests the public to comment on the inclusion of this table in this proposal. Summarizing the section, OSHA would require that employers provide their workers with washing and toilet facilities that are equipped with hot and cold (or tepid) running water; soap; clean hand towels (or warm air blowers); clean and functional toilets (that offer separate compartments with a latched door), and clean drinking water (with no common cups). The consumption of food or drink would continue to be prohibited wherever hazardous materials are stowed or being handled (see definition at 1918.2(g)). Additionally, cargo handling operations are to be separated (by barriers) from the vessel's uncovered refuse and, in the unlikely event of a sanitary line overboard discharge, from it as well. Since longshoring work is performed adjacent to a marine terminal, if the marine terminal's sanitation facilities are available for longshore employees' use, this would constitute compliance with 1918.95. (Section 1917.127, which covers sanitation at marine terminals, is virtually identical to proposed 1918.95.) Because longshoring operations generally take place in a location with restricted space, i.e., aboard a ship, other non-associated but often necessary work (such as ship's maintenance and repair) must be conducted carefully, with due deference to the cargo handling being performed. In such circumstances, employees may be exposed to hazards associated with excessive noise leading to impaired communications, excessive light or heat from hot work, overspray from abrasive blasting or spray painting, or non-ionizing radiation. In OSHA's current rules for Longshoring (1918.95), the Agency has prescribed requirements to account for the hazards that can be anticipated when maintenance and repair work are concurrently undertaken with cargo handling. Those same rules are proposed in 1918.95 (with very minor change) to be included in the revision of this part. Summarizing them, longshoring operations would be prohibited when noise produced by such concurrent work interferes with the communication of warnings or instructions; when falling objects could fall on cargo handlers from such work being conducted overhead; when welding slag, burning sparks or welding rod flash could injure cargo handlers; and when abrasive blasting or spray painting is being performed in the vicinity of cargo operations. Additionally, OSHA is proposing to prohibit cargo handling operations where the employees are exposed to electromagnetic (non-ionizing) radiation that is emitted from the radio and radar equipment on the vessel. This could be especially dangerous when employees are working on the tops of containers while work is being done to the radar or radio equipment. OSHA is also aware of the dangers associated with non-ionizing radiation emitted from radio and television towers that are close to marine cargo handling facilities and has included the words ``or from radio or television transmitting towers ashore'' in this paragraph. OSHA issued a Hazard Information Bulletin on September 5, 1990, concerning a non-ionizing radiation incident caused by radio transmitting towers that were near a cargo handling facility. The radio frequency emissions were aimed in the direction of the cargo handling operation and the radiation caused longshore workers touching the crane wires and hooks to be burned. This situation was corrected by having the transmissions directed away from the cargo handling area, however other options were available such as, insulating the cargo hook, or providing proper personal protective equipment (Ex. 1&hyph;137). Proposed 1918.97 sets out requirements for first aid and lifesaving, and parallels closely the same considerations set out by OSHA in its rules for the shoreside aspect of marine cargo handling (1917.26). The hazards that this section is meant to address are those that would occur in the absence of first aid or rescue; that is, following an accident, this section is intended to mitigate the extent of injury to the employee. In summarizing this proposed section, the employer would be required to direct all employees to report all injuries. A first aid kit would be required to be available at each vessel being worked, with at least one person holding a valid first aid certificate also available to administer first aid. OSHA does not stipulate who the certificate's issuing organization must be, but remains consistent with its position taken while developing the Marine Terminals rule, wherein the agency stated at 46 FR 4193: No particular first aid course or approving agency is designated, so long as the certificate is issued by a responsible organization which requires successful completion of a course as evidence of qualification. OSHA sets out no specific criteria for the contents of the required first aid kit(s). The Agency does, however, propose to have those needs individualized by a physician who, in consultation with the employer, can customize first aid kit contents to the hazards to be encountered. This is consistent with the approach taken by OSHA in its General Industry (1910.151(b)) and its Construction standards (1926.50(d)(1)). OSHA believes this approach to be not only more flexible, but more protective as well. It should be noted that OSHA is proposing to amend the Marine Terminal regulations to read the same as what is being proposed in this draft in regards to first aid kits and emergency stretchers. Requiring weekly checks of the contents of first aid kits is again consistent with OSHA's Safety and Health Regulations for Construction, 1926.50(d)(2). Additionally, OSHA proposes to include more specific requirements addressing strength and design characteristics of emergency stretchers (Stokes baskets). These requirements reflect the terms of an agreement between the West Gulf Maritime Association and individual locals of the I.L.A. operating on the Gulf of Mexico, which OSHA considers to be appropriate for inclusion in the proposal. The requirement that the stretcher have at least four sets of ``effective'' patient restraints means that the restraints must be able to secure the patient to the stretcher even if the stretcher and patient is being lifted vertically. In an accident cited earlier in the preamble, (Ex. 1&hyph;90), where the employee was being carried vertically in the stretcher, the restraints were not effective and the patient fell off. In proposed 1918.98, OSHA sets out requirements for the qualifications of machinery operators, i.e., crane or winch operators, industrial truck drivers, conveyor operators, etc., and provides proposed language to require the training of supervisory personnel, i.e., gang foremen, stevedore superintendents, etc., in accident prevention. The hazards addressed by this section arise from inexperienced, untrained or inappropriate operators of cargo handling machinery; and hazards created by improperly trained supervisory personnel. These hazards can readily lead to accidental injury or death. Both topics originate in the shoreside rules (1917.27), and focus on very important aspects indisputably tied to safe cargo operations. The proposed provisions would require that all employees (except supervised trainees) be familiar with signs, signals and operating instructions before operating cargo handling machinery or before giving signals to operators. OSHA would require that employee competency to perform such work be determined by the employer, using training and experience as criteria in making such a determination. The employer would be prohibited from allowing employees with a known incapacitating ailment, such as heart disease or epilepsy, or employees with defective uncorrected hearing or eyesight, from operating that equipment. Because supervisory training is considered to be essential to reducing the amount of accidents in any industrial setting, the Agency proposes to set requirements for the shipboard cargo handling workplace that will complement such requirements already in place for shoreside work. OSHA asks the public to comment on the effectiveness of the shoreside supervisory programs and benefits that have been derived. In proposing this requirement, the Agency notes that the great majority of supervisory persons already trained in accident prevention under the part 1917 rules, are those same individuals who would be covered by the training requirement under this proposal. The Agency requests interested persons to submit comment on the proportion of supervisory employees for whom such training would actually be required. The same built-in transition periods established for training within the Marine Terminals rule (two years after the promulgation of the final rule and after that date 90 days after supervisory assignment), are proposed also for shipboard application. The criteria for course content is performance-based, allowing for instruction to be tailored to the particular operation(s). The recommended topics included as a footnote are considered to be rudimentary to most shipboard cargo handling operations. It should be noted that current 1918.98 entitled ``Grain fitting'' is being deleted by this proposal. OSHA believes that this type of longshoring operation is obsolete and no longer exists. OSHA, however, recognizes that interested parties may have differing views regarding this deletion and invite comment on this point. Subpart J_Personal Protective Equipment All proposed sections of this subpart are based in the requirements for personal protective equipment found in the shoreside requirements for marine cargo handling (1917.91, 1917.92, 1917.92, 1917.93, 1917.94, and 1917.95). The hazards addressed by this section are those that personal protective equipment can eliminate or ameliorate by its proper use. For example, eye protection can prevent the loss of an eye; foot protection can prevent a broken foot; respirators can prevent toxic poisoning; and so on. As was the case in that rulemaking, (48 FR 30903), OSHA again sets out the principle that whether the PPE costs must be borne by employers depends largely on whether the employee has possession, responsibility and control over the specific piece of equipment. As an example, items such as protective gloves and foot wear are among pieces of gear that employees may bring home for personal use between work shifts, but the employees would be protected by the gear while at work. As such, the employer has to make available and assure that employees wear such equipment, but the standard does not require the employer to furnish it free of cost. Other items however, such as respirators, fall protection systems and special protective clothing, are pieces of gear that the employer is required to furnish and maintain. These are items that do not leave the workplace and are always under the control of the employer. Such items are those for which the employee is not obligated to bear any cost under the standards. OSHA understands that various arrangements exist for shared cost responsibilities and sole cost responsibilities at different parts of the Nation's waterfront, and leaves to the employers and employees the right to resolve such issues. Proposed 1918.101, would require employees performing work which is hazardous to the eyes be provided with protection that meets the requirements (evidenced by marking or labeling) of the American National Standard for Occupational and Educational Eye and Face Protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989). Such eye protection would be required to be maintained in good condition, with cleaning and disinfection performed prior to issuance to another worker. Proposed 1918.102 refers to 1918.1(b)(12), which adopts by reference OSHA's General Industry standard for respiratory protection (1910.134). The shipboard cargo handling environment is not unique in the selection or use of respiratory protection. In proposed 1918.103, the Agency requires that employees whose heads are exposed to hazards associated with impact or electric shocks or burns be equipped with and be required to wear protective hats that meet the design requirements (evidenced by marking or labeling) of American National Standard Requirements for Protective Head Wear for Industrial Workers (ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986). It also requires that cleaning and disinfection be performed when reissued to another worker. Proposed 1918.104 addresses foot protection, requiring that employees exposed to impact or puncture hazards wear safety footwear meeting the design requirements of the American National Standard for Personal Protection_Protective Footwear. ANSI Z41&hyph;1991. In this rulemaking, OSHA also proposes to update the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) references that are in the Marine Terminal standard so that they are the same as in the proposed Longshoring standard; 1917.91 (Eye protection); 1917.93 (Head protection); and 1917.94 (Foot protection). In proposed 1918.105, other forms of protective measures for personnel are addressed. In summary, OSHA adopts a general approach to all additional protective clothing which requires that the employer provide and see to the proper use of all such measures. The Agency would require that all additional protective clothing be cleaned and disinfected before reissuance. It notes, however, that some types of equipment, such as disposable coveralls, require no cleaning or disinfection since they are single use items and discarded once used. Also, in some instances protective clothing may be issued, but because never worn or soiled, necessitates no further sanitary measures. Personal flotation devices would be provided by the employer and required for all employees whose work exposes them to falls into the water in any of the following circumstances: when they are working in isolation (such as when adjusting by oneself mooring lines of a small craft abreast of a larger vessel); where physical constraints posed by limited working or walking area creates a fall hazard (such as when securing lines at the outboard edge of a barge having a narrow fore and aft walkway, or where the work area is obstructed by cargo or other obstacles in a manner that does not allow employees safe footing (such as when securing boom tie-downs at the outboard edge of a floating crane whose deck is congested with auxiliary hoisting equipment). OSHA is also proposing to add that personal flotation devices be worn by employees that are doing any work on the deck of a barge. There are numerous incidents of drowning which have occurred when employees have fallen overboard from a barge. Often these falls from a barge occur in the river system, where rapid currents increase the danger of drowning (Exs. 1&hyph;103, Case Nos. 13, 17, 18, 72, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 101, 130, 136, 139, 143). OSHA feels that the danger of falling overboard while working on the deck of a barge (as opposed to working on the deck of a ship where the edge of the deck generally is guarded by a bulwark and railing) is sufficiently great as to add this proposed language. All personal flotation devices would be required to be a Coast Guard approved preserver or vest, and would be expected to be maintained in a safe and serviceable condition (no rips, rot or punctures and all closure devices in good order). In all cases, it is clearly not enough just to have PPE available; the equipment needs to be used. The standard requires the employer to enforce the wearing of each type PPE whenever it is needed. Appendices I, II, and III Appendix I is a non-mandatory appendix that sets out the format of vessel cargo gear registers and certificates, under the terms of ILO Convention 152 (Ex. 1&hyph;33), discussed earlier in reference to 1918.11. Major changes from the original ILO Convention 32 (Ex. 1&hyph;34), include a new Form (Form No. 2 (U) which is a certificate issued by a ``competent person'' (most often a surveyor under the employ of a vessel classification society or inspection surety service) that contains the results of testing and examination of derricks used in union purchase. In the case of foreign flagged ship's gear with which U.S.longshore workers load or discharge cargo, OSHA acts in the role of the ``competent authority'' in determining which ``competent person(s)''/``responsible person(s)'' are in fact qualified to witness tests/exams and execute certificates and registers. For this purpose, as a practical matter, OSHA recognizes persons and organizations acceptable to the Nation under whose laws the particular vessel is registered. In the event that a given flag has no laws that specifically apply (Ex. 1&hyph;91), OSHA would rely upon the vessel having a register and certificates endorsed by an entity approved for that purpose by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard (see 46 CFR 91.37) or, alternately, an organization accredited by OSHA under part 1919 of this chapter (see proposed 1918.11). Another significant change from the original Convention, is the interval between tests of cargo handling gear. Such gear, under the terms of Convention 32, was required to be tested (for the assignment of a safe working load) initially before being taken into use. Because OSHA's current rule adopts the testing and examination requirements for vessel's cargo gear contained in Convention 32 (see 1918.12(a) of the current rules), the Agency can presently require that such gear is initially tested but, absent special circumstances, the gear is not required to be tested again. As a practical matter, most vessels (those operating under the rules of classification societies and international inspection services) have been operating under a quadrennial test schedule. With the advent of Convention 152, the international standard has shifted to ``at least once in every five years,'' giving latitude to all organizations desiring to maintain the four year cycle. In proposing to stay in step with the international standard, OSHA offers this Appendix to assist employers and employees in correctly ascertaining the form and content of registers and certificates prescribed for in the newer Convention. Appendix II, which is also non-mandatory, is offered as an aid to employers and employees in arriving at strength values of various pieces of gear used aboard ship in longshoring operations. Although the primary source for information on component gear strength is ``the manufacturer's recommendations'' or ``the manufacturer's recommended ratings,'' the Agency appreciates that instances will arise wherein such recommendations or ratings will not be available (such as when some preslung cargoes are to be discharged from foreign ports). In such instances, proposed Appendix contains tables which can be used to evaluate hoisting equipment. Many of the tables appearing in this Appendix are taken directly from the latest American National Standard (ASME B30.9&hyph;1990 and addenda titled, Slings) (Ex. 1&hyph;148). The balance of the tables (those for allowable chain wear; shackle safe working loads; and wire rope clips) are derived from an amalgam of other OSHA rules for Longshoring, Construction (1926.251), and General Industry (1910.184). These tables have been carefully assessed by OSHA as to their appropriateness for cargo handling applications, and the Agency believes that they will serve as fully protective criteria. Appendix III, which is also non-mandatory, recognizes that, in some very limited situations, the use of fall protection may be infeasible. OSHA has listed two narrowly defined situations where it feels that fall protection may not be feasible. OSHA solicits comment from the public regarding the appropriateness of these two examples and whether there are additional examples of infeasibility. In addition, OSHA would consider this as an appropriate place to include any other advisory information regarding container top safety and solicits comments accordingly. VI. Proposed Amendments and Corrections To Marine Terminal Standards Several of the proposed amendments to the Longshoring standard (part 1918) address marine cargo handling hazards that should be reflected by a corresponding provision in the Marine Terminal standard (part 1917). For example, both parts currently do not explicitly prohibit employees from riding the hook or the load. By contrast, proposed 1918.81(l) prohibits this practice as does proposed 1917.45(l). The basis for this prohibition is discussed above. For the purposes of this discussion, when the basis for a proposed amendment is treated in the preamble above, it is not necessary to repeat it here. OSHA is requesting comment from the public on proposed amendments to Marine Terminals (part 1917) standards. A new paragraph (d) has been added to 1917.11 that addresses the hazards associated with protruding nails that may be left in materials, such as dunnage, that have ben removed from the vessels and placed ashore. This paragraph has been taken from language that is in the current Longshoring regulations and is in the proposal at 1918.91(h)(2). Currently in both parts, the allowable exposure limits for carbon monoxide is 50 ppm over an 8-hour time weighted average with a ceiling of 100 ppm. OSHA is proposing to change the 8-hour time weighted average to 35 ppm while leaving the ceiling limit at 100 ppm. This change is reflected in both proposed parts in 1918.94 and 1917.24. (See above.) In another example, currently in both 1918.96 and 1917.26, the contents of a first-aid kit are specifically listed. In proposed 1918.96, however, the contents of a first-aid kit are to be determined by a physician. OSHA feels that the proposed part 1918 standard is more protective and proposes to amend 1917.26 to be consistent. OSHA would also incorporate into part 1917 the more extensive provisions that are found in proposed 1918.96 pertaining to the requirements for stokes basket stretchers. In 1917.45(j)(2), OSHA is proposing to require that all cranes used to hoist personnel be equipped with and operate in the power up and power down mode and have the brake apply automatically when not hoisting or lowering. This is consistent with proposed 1918.66(c)(2). OSHA is proposing a new requirement in 1917.50(i)(1), that prohibits exceeding the safe working load of cargo handing gear which is similar to language found in proposed 1918.61(b)(1). OSHA is also proposing a new requirement in 1917.50(i)(2), which requires the safe working load be marked on cargo handling gear with a safe working load greater than 5 short tons. This proposal is similar to proposed 1918.61(b)(2). See the discussion on these proposed requirements in the preamble for 1918.61. In 1917.71(e), OSHA is proposing to allow only high-visibility vests (or equivalent protection) to be worn and remove the words ``decals or reflectors.'' This would be in agreement with proposed 1918.86(n). As indicated above, the reflective area of a decal on a hard hat is obviously less than that of a vest. Also, the reflective value is lost during daylight hours or whenever the wearer takes off the hard hat. A number of serious accidents (Exs. 1&hyph;78, 1&hyph;89) have occurred in the past due to the nature of the work involved in such cargo operations. Additionally, OSHA is proposing to amend the language found in 1917.71(f)(5) to reflect the language found in proposed 1918.86(f), which requires that all brake air-lines be connected when pulling trailers equipped with air brakes. OSHA is proposing to change 1917.73(a)(2) to read 10 ppm of hydrogen sulfide to agree with proposed 1918.94(f)(4). As recently as 1987, a hydrogen sulfide incident aboard a menhaden vessel led to serious injury and a fatality (Ex. 1&hyph;80). (See discussion of this for 1918.94(f) in Section V of this proposal). OSHA proposes to carry over to 1917.71 the provision found in proposed 1918.86(g) that requires that flat bed and low boys trailers (mafi's) be marked with their cargo capacities and not be overloaded. OSHA also seeks public comment on two proposed rules to be included in the Marine Terminal standard that do not have analogous rules in the proposed Longshoring standard. First, OSHA proposes to require that seat (lap) belt restraints be installed in the crane operators seat in high-speed container gantry cranes. High speed container gantry cranes are now capable of hoist speeds of 360 feet per minute (110 m/min) (without a load) and trolley speeds of 500 feet per minute (152 m/min). OSHA is concerned that the operator may be exposed to potentially injurious effects of sudden stops and starts (Ex. 1&hyph;133). OSHA believes that operator restraints will minimize the hazard and seeks comment from the public on this issue. In the case of shipments of tobacco that have been containerized and then fumigated, OSHA is proposing, in 1917.25(g), that such containers be aerated (before being loaded on a ship) as follows: (1) If in unsealed bales or in hogsheads, aerated (with doors open) for 48 hours after fumigation has been completed, and, (2) if contained in a plastic enclosure, aerated (with doors open) for 72 hours. In proposing these requirements, OSHA relies on studies performed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service (Ex. 1&hyph;70). These studies concluded that intermodal containers so treated required 48 to 72 hours aeration to be free of hazardous fumigant levels. Past and recent communications (Ex. 1&hyph;95) with the Tobacco Association of the United States, also show that organization in accord with the 72-hour aeration required for tobacco shipped in polyethylene or similarly lined boxes carried in intermodal containers. Upon the publication of the final Marine Terminal standard, several technical drafting amendments were treated in the preamble that were not consistently picked up in the subsequent regulatory text. OSHA is now proposing that these amendments be made. Several paragraphs have been corrected by removing the phrase, ``The employer shall ensure...'', from the beginning of the paragraph. See the discussion for this in 48 FR 30888&hyph;30889. The paragraphs that have been corrected in this manner are: 1917.18(a); 1917.43(e)(1)(i); 1917.44(o)(3)(ii); 1917.44(o)(4); 1917.126(b); 1917.152(f)(1); 1917.152(f)(2) and 1917.152(f)(3)(iv). In addition, several paragraphs are being proposed to be revised by changing the phrase, ``shall be available at the terminal'' to the phrase, ``shall be made available for inspection''. See the discussion for this in 48 FR 30889. The proposed paragraphs that reflect this change are: 1917.24(d), 1917.25.(c), 1917.42(b)(4), 1917.42(c)(1), 1917.42(d)(1), 1917.42(h)(4), and 1917.42(h)(5). OSHA is also aware of several typographical errors that are in the current 29 CFR part 1917 and intends to correct those in this rulemaking. For example, one of these corrections is in 1917.42. A square root sign has been added to the formula found in paragraph (d)(2), correcting an error that is in the current formula. OSHA seeks public comment on any other areas in the Marine Terminal standard that are affected because of the changes proposed to the Longshoring standard in this rulemaking. VII. Other Issues A. OSHA is raising the issue of the possible harmful effects of diesel exhaust on employees, especially those employees who work Ro/Ro vessels where exposure to such exhaust is probably the greatest. OSHA is aware that studies have been done concerning the effects of diesel exhaust by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in the mining industry. OSHA is not aware of any studies relating to the longshoring industry, (although the International Cargo Handling and Coordination Association (ICHCA) is in the process of drafting a paper entitled ``Fumes in Ships'', which will address this topic), and requests the public to submit pertinent information. OSHA requests information of the following: 1. What are the health effects of diesel exhaust? 2. What are the typical timeframes where employees are exposed to diesel exhaust? 3. Is mechanical ventilation sufficient to eliminate any harmful effects? 4. What other methods can be employed to reduce any harmful effects? B. OSHA is aware of the problem of picking up the chassis and fifth wheel along with the container due to the failure of the container and chassis to separate during a loading operation. This is due to one or more of the chassis's twistlocks being in the locked position or one or more of the twist locks ``hanging up'' while in the unlocked position. Unfortunately, the driver of the fifth wheel is in the cab as it is being lifted and often sustains injuries when the cab and chassis fall back to the ground before the crane operator can lower everything back down. OSHA requests information on the following questions: 1) How frequently does this problem occur;? 2) OSHA believes this is primarily a problem on the West Coast. Is this true and why;? 3) OSHA is aware of several devices that have been developed to shut the crane down once the device detects the fifth wheel being raised off the ground. OSHA seeks information on the effectiveness of these devices in eliminating the problem, and the cost to purchase and install these devices; 4) Are there other ways to eliminate the problem, such as better ``monitoring'' of the chassis twistlocks under the hook through training and work practices, or requiring the driver to get out of the cab until the container is lifted clear of the chassis? C. OSHA has long recognized the utility of comprehensive occupational safety and health programs, and adopted non-mandatory guidance for safety and health program management on January 26, 1989 (54 FR 3904). These guidelines were based on a distillation of safety and health management practices used by employers that have implemented successful comprehensive programs. The major elements OSHA identified in the guidelines for effective occupational safety and health programs are: 1) management commitment and employee involvement; 2) worksite analysis to anticipate and identify potential hazards; 3) hazard prevention and control; and 4) safety and health training. Successfully implemented programs generally result in facilities that have a lower incidence of occupationally related illnesses and injuries. In particular, OSHA has found that companies which have implemented comprehensive safety and health programs and are participating in its Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) have lost-workday rates that range from one-fifth to one-third the rates experienced by average worksites within their industrial classification. In addition, participating sites have reported improved employee morale, product quality, and productivity as some of the secondary benefits of their safety and health management activities. Occupational safety and health standards and guidelines, whether mandatory or developed as voluntary consensus activities, traditionally have tended to focus on specific problems or hazards rather than taking a broad, program-oriented approach. In recent years, however, OSHA has promulgated a number of generic standards that have program requirements. There is now increasing evidence that a requirement for all employers to address occupational safety and health programmatically can provide an effective supplement to specific hazard-related requirements, and provides an added degree of safety and health for employees. Properly designed and implemented comprehensive programs focus the attention of both employers and employees on safety and health in the workplace. With increased awareness of safety and health concerns, and the commitment to alleviate the hazards by implementing appropriate controls, workplace-related safety and health injuries and illnesses are expected to decrease. While the specific elements of existing comprehensive occupational safety and health (COSH) programs may vary, the general concept is the same. COSH programs are designed to coordinate and integrate all facets of occupational safety and health into the management practices for the facility. Rather than addressing problems on a one-by-one basis, implementation of a COSH program requires company management to systematically review all hazards in the facility, and develop a plan to prevent or control them. All employees of the facility must be involved in the development and implementation of the plan, and there must be a company-wide commitment to controlling or eliminating occupational safety and health problems. The program is implemented on a continuing basis, that is, there are provisions for ensuring that the situation in the facility is monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the program is working. Program evaluation activities to assess effectiveness are also part of the concept. The logic of this approach is simple_prevent adverse effects from occurring by identifying hazards, and implementing a plan to eliminate or minimize them. By doing this systematically, resources are not duplicated or wasted, and a coordinated, integrated strategy can be implemented. Effective functioning of such a program depends largely on the commitment and involvement of all members of the organization, beginning with the highest level of management. OSHA believes the COSH program approach can be applied in any establishment, and in any size facility. The complexity of the specific program in a particular establishment will depend on the nature of the business, the number of employees, and the types of hazards present. While the basic components of a COSH program would be the same in, for example, a marine terminal and an automobile manufacturing plant shop, the methods used to implement them would vary based on the different needs of the facilities. Every type and size of establishment should nevertheless have a systematic approach to addressing occupational safety and health concerns. All workplaces, from office situations to health care facilities, restaurants to stevedoring operations, can benefit from the development and implementation of an appropriate COSH program. Request for Comments and Information OSHA is raising this issue to solicit public input on COSH programs. The Agency is particularly interested in learning about the experiences of employers who have already implemented such programs, and those of employees who work in facilities where these programs have been implemented. The purpose of collecting these comments is to determine whether OSHA should adopt mandatory requirements for comprehensive occupational safety and health programs; what the components of such programs should be; what problems employers have had in implementing such programs, and what can be done to alleviate those problems; the benefits of implementing COSH programs; methods that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs; the costs and economic feasibility of such programs; the impacts on small businesses; and suggestions regarding existing OSHA rules that could be consolidated or modified as a result of promulgating requirements for mandatory COSH programs. Format of Questions and Responses The specific questions asked are designed to elicit the information OSHA believes would be helpful in determining appropriate elements for COSH programs in longshoring work. The questions are in some cases directed towards specific audiences, such as employers who have implemented programs. Other questions have more general applicability. Interested persons may also submit other information or opinions which they believe are relevant. OSHA asks that commenters respond to the specific questions enumerated, and to number responses in accordance with the number of the question to which the response is addressed. In addition, it would also be helpful for OSHA to receive copies of written materials to supplement these responses, such as copies of written programs, examples of forms used, and sample evaluations. 1) OSHA would like to receive information and data regarding the respondents to this notice in order to properly profile the responses. If you are submitting comments in response to this notice on behalf of an employer or group of employers that have implemented a COSH program, or employee or group of employees working in such a facility, please provide the following specific information. If you are not one of either of these groups, please indicate your role or relation to COSH programs. a) The size of the facility by number of employees; b) When the program was implemented; c) Why the program was implemented ( e.g ., voluntary decision, state requirements, insurance carrier's requirements, etc.); d) What the major components of the existing program are; e) What the initial and annual costs of implementing each of these components have been, and how you derived these costs; f) What resources have been required to operate the programs; and, g) What cost savings, illness or injury reductions, or other benefits (e.g., changes in productivity, absenteeism, turnover, insurance, etc.) have accrued due to implementation of the program, and how you derived these benefits. Components of a COSH Program As described above, OSHA has published and distributed guidelines for safety and health management programs which include four major elements. OSHA would like comments on whether these elements are appropriate; whether more specific information should be provided regarding what should be addressed under each of these elements; and what other elements may be appropriate for inclusion in COSH programs. Management commitment and employee involvement . The first element included in the guidelines is management commitment and employee involvement, or management leadership. Management commitment is expected to be stated in a worksite policy which outlines the organization's priority on safety and health, and indicates who has primary responsibility for implementation of various aspects of the policy. Other facets of this element include establishing and communicating clear goals and objectives for the program; providing visible management involvement; ensuring employee involvement; providing adequate authority and resources for those responsible; holding those responsible accountable; ensuring contract workers are protected; and reviewing and evaluating the program at least annually. 2) Please comment on the inclusion of management commitment and employee involvement as a major element of a COSH program. It has been OSHA's experience and that there is no situation where these considerations are inappropriate. 3) Is this a common program component? How is it implemented? Is the program integrated into the overall management of the workplace? How well does this work? 4) Who is responsible for managing the program? What skills and knowledge must this person have to be the program manager? What is the role of the President or Chief Executive Officer? The facility manager? The supervisor? The employee? Do performance evaluations include an assessment of performance with regard to safety and health? Are managers and employees held accountable for safety and health performance? How? 5) Are written policy statements prepared and distributed? Please provide examples. Are there situations where a program can operate effectively without having a written plan? 6) What was the primary motivation for implementing the program (e.g., voluntary, state requirements)? Have insurance companies encouraged adoption of COSH programs? How was this done? 7) How is employee involvement ensured in existing programs? Are labor-management committees used? If so, please provide details about how the committees are formed and are operating. What other suggestions do you have for ensuring employee involvement? 8) How are existing programs evaluated to determine whether or not they are effective? Are worksite program audits conducted? What do the audits include? How often are workplace conditions reevaluated after the initial assessment? Please provide copies of any evaluation procedures that may be available. What are the criteria for determining that the program is or is not effective? What type of evidence is required to demonstrate that each program element has been implemented? Is the program integrated into the overall management of the workplace? 9) Have any problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately? What other information would be useful? Worksite analysis . The second element in the guidelines is worksite analysis. Employers must identify all worksite hazards by conducting an initial and subsequent periodic comprehensive baseline worksite surveys for safety and health. The surveys would vary by the type of workplace, and the nature of the hazards present, but would include an assessment of both safety and health hazards. Examples of situations that would have to be assessed would include: exposure to chemicals; exposure to noise, radiation, or other physical hazards; ergonomics hazards; procedures to handle chemicals that have physical effects such as flammability and reactivity; machine guarding; shoring of trenches; and potential for falls. Programs must include provisions for regular worksite inspections to determine if existing controls are working, and to identify uncontrolled hazards; investigations of accidents, or other unusual incidents; analysis of planned and new facilities, processes, materials and equipment; job hazard analysis; an employee hazard reporting system; and analysis of injury and illness trends. 10) Do existing programs you are familiar with include worksite analysis? How is it implemented, and who is responsible for doing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs. What criteria are used to determine what hazards are present? Are there OSHA standards, guidelines, or other documents you can recommend to assist employers? What do you consider to be the most significant hazard in the workplace? 11) Do existing programs include chemical exposure assessments as part of the worksite analysis process? Should further guidance be provided for exposure assessment? What criteria for exposure assessment are used in existing programs? Is exposure monitoring conducted? What criteria are used to determine when monitoring is to be done? Who is performing exposure monitoring? What training or background did they have to prepare them for this? Are other types of hazards subject to monitoring (such as noise, radiation)? What criteria are used to monitor these hazards? 12) Do existing programs include an ergonomics component? How are ergonomics problems identified? What criteria are used? Who does the evaluation, and what is their relevant training or background? 13) Has any illness/injury trend analysis been undertaken in facilities with COSH programs? What have the trends shown? What action was taken as a result of the findings? Please provide any trend data you have to demonstrate the effect of such programs. 14) What problems have been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? How were these problems solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately? What other information would be useful? Hazard prevention and control. Once the hazards have been identified, the third element the COSH program must address is hazard prevention and control. The current and potential hazards must be corrected or controlled in a timely manner, using engineering techniques where feasible and appropriate. Procedures for working safely are to be established, and all affected parties must understand and follow them. Personal protective equipment is to be made available where appropriate; administrative controls are to be used when necessary; provision is to be made for repair and maintenance of equipment; emergency preparedness is to be addressed; and a medical program must be available. 15) Do existing programs you are familiar with include hazard prevention and control? How is it implemented, and who is responsible for doing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs. In particular, please provide any available information about how hazards and risks are defined, and how risk reduction goals are set. Who decides what control measures are implemented? What criteria are used? Does the program include an evaluation of occupational safety and health implications when new facilities, processes, materials, or equipment are planned? 16) Do existing programs include standard operating procedures for repair and maintenance? 17) Are their programs for emergency preparedness? If so, how are they compiled and made available? Is there a plan for emergency response? If so, what types of emergencies are addressed? Please provide samples of your standard operating procedures and emergency preparedness and response plans. 18) Is a medical program available? What is the scope of the program, e.g. does it cover assessments related to workplace conditions, wellness programs, etc.? Are medical services provided in-house, or are they contracted out? What types of health professionals are involved in delivering occupational health services? What are their respective roles and what is their relevant training or background? 19) Does the medical program include preplacement medical surveillance? Periodic medical surveillance? What criteria are used to determine what surveillance is done? Who decides what surveillance is to be done? Are medical records reviewed to determine if there are trends in injuries and illnesses? Who conducts the review? What is done with the results? 20) Have problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately? What other information would be useful? Safety and health training . The last major element in the voluntary guidelines for COSH programs is safety and health training. In order to ensure that the program works effectively, all employees must be trained to understand the safety and health concerns in their workplace; the plan to minimize or eliminate those concerns; and their roles in implementation of the plan. This includes training for those in supervisory or management roles. Responsibilities must be clearly described, and the lines of authority appropriately drawn. OSHA has published Voluntary Training Guidelines to provide employers with information about designing and implementing an appropriate safety and health training program. (See Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines, OSHA 2254 (Revised), 1992.) 21) Do existing programs include safety and health training? How is it implemented, and who is responsible for performing and implementing it? Please provide examples of how this element is being implemented in existing programs, including the type of training, such as classroom instruction, on-the-job work practices training, videotapes, or interactive videos. Does the type of training vary with the type of operation? Have OSHA's Voluntary Training Guidelines been used in designing and implementing the safety and health training program? 22) Is safety and health training conducted prior to workplace assignment? What does it include in this situation? Are training requirements for various programs combined into one training program? Approximately how long does the initial training take for managers? For supervisors? For other workers? Is periodic training conducted? How often? How long does periodic training take? What is included in the periodic training? 23) Do you have workers who are subject to training certification requirements? How has this worked? 24) Is the training evaluated to determine whether or not it is effective? How is this done? 25) What qualifications do the trainers have? 26) Have problems been encountered in implementing this element in existing programs? If so, how were these problems solved? Is the guidance provided in the voluntary guidelines sufficient to implement this element appropriately? What other information would be useful? Issues Related to Regulation If OSHA determines that it would be appropriate to promulgate a standard for COSH programs, there are a number of other issues which will have to be addressed. Comments from the public are solicited on the following: 27) Should the voluntary guidelines OSHA issued in 1989 be the primary basis for any future regulatory activity in this area? Based on your experiences, what modifications to the guidelines would be necessary in order for OSHA to use them as a basis for regulation? Are there additional elements that should be included in a COSH program? What other information do you think employers would need to implement an appropriate program? 28) The current guidelines are very generally written, and OSHA believes they can be applied in any type of industry or workplace. Do you think that industry-specific guidelines are required? If so, what should the breakdown be, and what is the rationale for different program requirements? 29) The current guidelines are also applicable to all sizes of industries. Do you think that small businesses should be treated differently? If so, why, and in what way? 30) It has been suggested that if OSHA promulgates requirements for COSH programs, there are existing OSHA standards that could be revised, modified, consolidated, or otherwise changed as a result. Without diminishing employee protections under current OSHA standards, what rules do you think could be reconsidered if the Agency promulgates a new rule requiring COSH programs? Commenters are requested to be specific, and provide the rationale for any suggestions. 31) If OSHA promulgates a rule for COSH programs, what type of outreach or compliance assistance materials would you suggest be made available to employers? What would be the most effective way for OSHA to reach small employers who do not belong to trade associations or professional societies? D. OSHA is aware of the increased usage of Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers (FIBC's) which are used to handle bulk chemical solids. Some of the FIBC's are designed only to be used for one voyage while others are designed for repeated usage. OSHA wishes to know: 1) What means are used to mark and identify the one use only type of FIBC, and are they adequate? and 2) What are the current industry practices regarding the testing of FIBC's and should OSHA incorporate them into this regulation? E. OSHA issued a standard for the control of hazardous energy sources (lockout/tagout) that applied to general industry employment under 29 CFR part 1910 as 1910.147 (54 FR 36645). This standard addresses practices and procedures that are necessary to disable machinery or equipment and to prevent the release of potentially hazardous energy while maintenance and servicing activities are being performed. The standard requires that lockout be utilized for equipment which is designed with a lockout capacity, and tagout may be used for equipment which was not designed to be locked out. Servicing and maintenance activities are necessary adjuncts to the industrial process. They are needed to maintain the ability of all machines, equipment, or processes to perform their intended functions. OSHA believes that these types of operations present the employee with the same types of hazards of unexpected activation, re-energization, or the release of stored energy, regardless of the type of industrial setting. For these reasons, OSHA is soliciting public comment regarding the appropriateness of including ``The control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout)'' in the ``Scope and applicability'' sections of both 29 CFR part 1917 (Marine Terminals) and 29 CFR part 1918 (Longshoring). While OSHA recognizes that marine terminal activities are more likely to contain work operations where lockout/tagout hazards are present, it also sees the potential to occur in some longshoring related operations. OSHA wants to know: 1) should 1910.147 be included in Marine Terminals and why or why not, and 2) should 1910.147 be included in longshoring and why or why not? F. As indicated earlier, OSHA contracted a safety expert, A. J. Scardino, to conduct a study of the fall hazards associated with the cargo handling of intermodal containers. (Ex. 1&hyph;139). The development of the data, that was used in formulating the opinions and recommendations of this study, involved the visiting and documentation of the activities at 20 major ports in the United States. Those ports were: Gulfport, MS, Houston, TX, Barbers Cut, TX, Galveston, TX, Miami, FL, Miami River, FL, Port Everglade, FL, Charleston, SC, Savannah, GA, Norfolk, VA, Portsmith, VA, Elizabeth, NJ, New Jersey, NJ, Long Beach, CA, Los Angeles, CA, Seattle, WA, Tacoma, WA, Oakland, CA, San Francisco, CA, Honolulu, HI. As part of the data gathering process the contractor conferred with: members of the Technical Committee of the National Maritime Safety Association, representatives of Labor Associations, individual Stevedores, Longshore personnel, and Port representatives. Of the many areas of inquiry that resulted in positive recommendations, the issue of the location of the fixed anchorage point in relation to the working surface was addressed: When feasible the attachment point of the fall protection system shall be located ``above'' the head of the employee. Every effort should be made to assure that the attachment point for the system is located no lower than the vertical height position of the harness ``D'' ring. According to ``Humanscale 7a'', for the 50th percentile male, this would be 1.4 meters (55.4 inches). In support of this position, the study cites the National Safety Council in its Accident Prevention Manual for Industrial Operations 9th. Edition (the Bible on Safety) states: (p. 347) ``A belt or harness is worthless unless it is being worn at the time that a fall is possible and attached to a lanyard or fall arrestor with an adequate overhead anchorage .'' (Emphasis added; Id. p. 3.) In addition Mr. Scardino indicates the importance of pre-exposure planning by citing Best's Safety Directory 1994 Edition which states: (p634) ``A fixture point above head height always should be planned.'' (Id.)(Ex. 1&hyph;153). With regard to current practice, many fall protection systems in use could meet the raised attachment requirement recommended by Mr. Scardino ``\u00a7*&blank;*&blank;* approximately 70 to 75% of the existing operations that employ various fall protection techniques would be able to meet *&blank;*&blank;*'' the requirement. (Id.) Some existing systems have attachments to devices that are installed on the work surface. Recommendations addressing these systems include: The use of systems that are at foot level, thereby creating a tripping hazard, should be discouraged. If these systems are to be used, then, the components that make up the system should be of a high visibility color. This field study further determined that these systems were not reliable and created a sense of false security. While it is recognized that there is in existence, fall protection that does not meet this criteria, steps should be taken to meet these minimums within a three year period. In light of these recommendations, OSHA wishes to raise an additional issue. To what extent is it necessary and appropriate to add an additional criteria to those found in 1918.85(k) requiring an elevated anchorage point in order to assure worker safety. VIII. Preliminary Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Note: Numbered references that appear in brackets in this Section VIII, Preliminary Regulatory Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, are to the References that appear at the end of Section VIII. A. Executive Summary Introduction Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act require OSHA to analyze the costs, benefits, and other consequences and impacts associated with proposed standards. Consistent with these requirements, OSHA has prepared this regulatory impact analysis for the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards. This analysis includes a description of the industries affected by the regulation, an evaluation of the risks addressed, an assessment of the benefits attributable to the proposed revisions, the determination of the technological feasibility of the new requirements, the estimation of the costs of compliance with proposed revisions, the determination of the economic feasibility of compliance with the proposed revisions, and an analysis of the economic and other impacts associated with this rulemaking. Affected Industries The requirements of the proposed revisions apply to all establishments involved in marine cargo handling. As classified by the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) manual, this industry consists of establishments in SIC 4491 as well as establishments in other SICs conducting marine cargo handling activities. Evaluation of Risk and Potential Benefits An estimated 7,593 injuries and 18 fatalities occur annually during marine cargo handling activities. The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to result in the prevention of 1,262 injuries and 3 fatalities, annually. Many additional fatalities and injuries would be prevented through full compliance with existing requirements retained in the proposed standards. Most of the injuries occurring during marine cargo handling activities could be prevented through compliance with the existing as well as with the proposed standards. In addition to the unquantifiable benefits associated with the reduction in pain and suffering associated with these incidents, the prevention of these injuries will result in savings of over $18 million dollars, annually. This estimate includes savings related to wage and productivity losses, medical costs, administrative expenses, and other costs associated with accidents. Technological Feasibility Since the proposed requirements can be met using existing equipment and methods, the proposed new requirements are considered to be technologically feasible. Costs The estimated costs associated with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards amount to less than $4.7 million for the first year and less than $1.8 million, annually, after the first year. These costs primarily reflect the sum of various minor expenditures associated with modifications to existing standards. New provisions involving compliance costs include requirements for sideboards on dockboards and ramps, required certification of fall protection systems, requirements for the vertical application of lifting forces to containers, requirements for high visibility vests, and requirements to provide personal flotation devices, among others. Economic Impacts Compliance with the proposed new requirements of the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards has been determined to be economically feasible and is not expected to produce any significant adverse economic impacts. The costs that are imposed by the regulation should be a minimal burden on marine cargo handling establishments. The total estimated first-year costs of compliance represent less than 0.06 percent of revenues associated with marine cargo handling activities and less than 1.19 percent of profits. Total annualized costs for subsequent years represent less than 0.03 percent of revenues and 0.46 percent of profits. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, OSHA has made an assessment of the impact of the revised standards and has concluded that it would not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The estimated compliance costs do not involve large capital expenditures, and there is no significant differential effect on small firms relative to that on large firms. B. Industry Profile Introduction This section provides an overview of affected establishments, classifications of affected vessels, population at risk, wages of affected workers, gang sizes and cargo handling rates, operating revenues and shipping costs. Overview of Stevedoring and Marine Terminals Marine terminals are designated areas of ports which include wharves, bulkheads, quays, piers, docks and other berthing locations. Adjacent storage or contiguous areas associated with the primary movements of cargo or materials from vessel to shore or shore to vessel, and structures devoted to receiving, handling, holding, consolidating, loading or delivering waterborne shipments are considered part of the marine terminal. Marine terminals are the facilities owned or leased by stevedores or marine terminal operators (MTOs). MTOs and stevedores provide most of the portside services that shipping lines require. They provide the equipment and machinery for conducting cargo handling at multi-use terminal facilities, in addition to specialized terminals designed to handle specific types of cargo [2]. Stevedores are persons or firms contracting with a ship owner or agent for the purpose of loading or unloading ships or barges in ports. Stevedores are direct employers of longshore labor and contractors to ship owners. Basically, they are middlemen between the entity requiring the service and the longshore workers who perform the physical labor. The stevedore's role is to provide the cargo handling expertise and the equipment required to load or unload all types of cargo safely and efficiently. The stevedore may also be the MTO. The functional roles and activities of stevedores and MTOs vary throughout the United States and often cannot be distinguished. The stevedore contractor and the MTO may be distinctly different entities, the same entity, or corporately related. In some cases, public entities or port authorities may be the MTOs. These entities may also act as stevedores or lease the terminals to private operators [2]. Workplaces Affected Compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards will affect two areas where marine cargo handling operations occur. Activities that occur off the dock (work aboard vessels) are covered under OSHA's Longshoring standard (29 CFR part 1918) and those which occur on the dock fall under the Marine Terminals standard (29 CFR part 1917). The Longshoring standard covers establishments classified under SIC 4491 (marine cargo handling), as well as various establishments in manufacturing; transportation; communications; electric, gas and sanitary services; and wholesale trade. Data on the exact number of stevedoring companies currently operating in the United States are not available. For the purposes of this analysis, the number of marine terminals estimated by the Maritime Administration (MARAD) was used as the estimate of the total number of firms affected by the Longshoring standard. According to MARAD, there are a total of 3,700 marine terminals in the United States [4]. Establishments engaged primarily in marine cargo handling are classified under Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 4491, Marine Cargo Handling. The Bureau of the Census estimated that 746 establishments are classified under SIC 4491 [7]. To identify other affected industry sectors, Kearney/Centaur screened OSHA inspection data for non-SIC 4491 sectors where 29 CFR part 1918 citations were issued. Non-SIC 4491 establishments primarily engage in activities other than longshoring, although longshore work is a small part of their overall operation. For example, manufacturing establishments which load their products directly onto barges are covered by the OSHA's Longshoring standard, though these operations represent only a very small part of their total activity. Kearney/Centaur estimated the distribution of the remaining establishments among affected industry sectors according to the distribution of non-SIC 4491 29 CFR part 1918 citations issued in other sectors. The estimated number of affected establishments is shown in Table B-1 by industry and in Table B-2 by region. Although only 20 percent of establishments affected by the longshoring standard are in SIC 4491, the majority of affected workers, as discussed below, are accounted for in SIC 4491. Table B&hyph;1_Number of Affected Establishments, by Industry 1Industry 1Longshoring 29 CFR part 1918 1Marine Terminals 29 CFR part 1917 SIC 4491--Marine Cargo Handling 746 746Manufacturing 1660 N/ATransportation, Communications, and Electric, Gas and Sanitary Services 662 662Wholesale Trade 273 161Other SICs1 359 359 TOTAL 3,700 1,928 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis, based on Kearney/Centaur [1, Chapter 2]. 1Other SICs include SIC 13 (Oil and Gas Extraction), SIC 15 (Building Construction), and sectors under SIC 44 (Water Transportation) other than SIC 4491. Table B&hyph;2_Number of Affected Establishments, by Region 1Industry 1Longshoring 29 CFR part 1918 1Marine Terminals 29 CFR part 1917 Atlantic 586 305 Gulf/Mississippi 2,164 1,128 Great Lakes 301 157 Pacific 649 338 TOTAL 3,700 1,928 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis, based on Kearney/Centaur [1, Chapter 2]. Of the industry sectors covered by the Longshoring standard, most also fall under the scope of the Marine Terminals standard, with the exception of manufacturing establishments and some wholesale trade establishments. Approximately 1,928 of the 3,700 marine terminals covered by the Longshoring standard are estimated to fall under the scope of the Marine Terminals standard [1]. The stevedore/MTO typically hires longshore workers, usually on a daily basis, from a hiring hall or labor pool of union or nonunion members. Labor force size varies directly with the amount of work contracted to be performed. This method of hiring creates difficulty in determining the size of the affected establishments. No data were available on the number of small stevedoring firms. To estimate the number of small firms, the percent of establishments in SIC 4491 classified by the Bureau of the Census as employing fewer than 20 workers, is used. Fifty-six percent of affected establishments are estimated to be small establishments [7]. Types of Vessels This discussion describes the affected vessels calling at U.S. marine terminals. The proposed rule will be applicable to five broad vessel categories. Four of these categories are self-propelled vessels: bulk carriers, freighters, combination passenger/cargo ships, and cruise ships. The fifth category consists of non-self-propelled dry cargo barges. Descriptions of these vessel categories, as well as important subcategories, are presented in Tables B-3 and B-4. Tankers and tanker barges are excluded since these vessels are primarily under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard. Table B&hyph;3_Categories of Self-Propelled Vessels 1&blank; 1&blank; 1 Bulk Carriers s Ships designed to carry dry bulk cargo such as ore, wood chips, coal, and grain. They are also used to carry heavy general cargo items such as logs or steel. s Freighters 0 s,s General Cargo Carriers Includes refrigerated and unrefrigerated breakbulk carriers as well as car carriers, cattle carriers, pallet carriers, and timber carriers. Breakbulk cargo consists of heterogenous items of general cargo, packaged and moved as single parcels or assembled together on pallet boards and wire rope slings. These packages are loaded and unloaded using ship's gear or wharf cranes. Containers are also carried on general cargo carriers. s,s Full Containerships Ships equipped with permanent below-deck container cells with little or no space for other types of cargo. s,s Partial Containerships Multi-purpose ships where one or more, but not all, compartments are fitted with permanent container cells. The remaining compartments are used for other types of cargo. Partial containerships include container/car carriers, container/rail car carriers, and container/roll-on/roll-off ships. s,s Roll-On/Roll-Off (RO-RO) Ships Ships which are specially designed to carry wheeled containers or container/trailer combinations, automobiles, and other vehicles which are loaded and unloaded using the roll-on/roll-off method. Containers are often carried on the upper deck of RO-RO ships. s,s Barge Carriers Ships designed to carry either barges or some variable number of barges and containers simultaneously. Currently this class includes two types of vessels, the LASH (lighter aboard ship) and the SEABEE. They differ in that barges are loaded onto LASH ships by crane and onto SEABEE ships by a submersible elevator at the stern of the vessel. s,s 1 Combination Passenger/Cargo Ships s Cargo ships with a capacity for 13 or more passengers. s Cruise Ships/Passenger Ships s Ships functioning primarily to transport passengers, usually for purposes of recreation and tourism. Does not include passenger ferries. 0 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis, based on Kearney/Centaur [1, Chapter 2]. Table B&hyph;4_Non-Self-Propelled Vessels 1&blank; 1&blank; 1 Dry Cargo Barges s Large mostly double hulled cargo holds lacking an internal means of propulsion. Virtually all barges used on the inland river system are 195 feet long by 35 feet wide and have loaded drafts of up to nine feet. Barges can carry virtually any dry cargo and have and average capacity of 1,500 tons or about 52,500 bushels. Also classified as barges are scows and ocean-going barges. These barges tend to be much larger and have a higher freeboard than barges used on the inland river system. Barges are typically lashed together in groups referred to as tows. The standard tow on most navigable rivers is three barges wide by five barges long for a total of 15 barges. Tow sizes, however, vary by waterway with tows as large as 45 barges on the lower Mississippi and as small as two barges on the intracoastal waterway. Tows are usually propelled by a towboat pushing them ahead, though occasionally they are moved by a towboat pulling them on a hawser. s 0 Open Hopper Barges used primarily for dry bulk cargo, such as sand, gravel,and coal, which are not suseptible to weather damage. s,s Covered Hopper Barges used for grain and other commodities that need to be protected from the weather. s,s Scows and Ocean-Going Barges Barges which generally carry most of their cargo on deck. s,s Deck Barges Barges used for transporting vehicles and heavy equipment. s,s Container Barges Barges used to transport standardized container cargo.

Self-Propelled Vessels Table B&hyph;5 shows the number of self-propelled vessels of 1,000 gross tons (GTs) and over in the world fleet, by type of vessel. Of the 692 U.S. flag vessels, approximately two-thirds are privately owned and the remaining one-third are Government owned. Only 11 of the 225 Government owned vessels were active as of mid&hyph;1992 and were being used by several Government agencies, state maritime academies, or private steamship companies under various forms of agreement with the Maritime Administration. All U.S. flag vessels are owned either by the Government or U.S. firms. However, U.S. firms also own a substantial number of merchant vessels that are registered under foreign flags. As shown in Table B&hyph;5, 313 of the 23,549 foreign flag vessels are owned by U.S. parent companies. Although no data were available on the total number of self-propelled vessels in the world fleet of under 1,000 Gts, data were available on the number of vessels calling at U.S. ports. According to Bureau of the Census data [5], approximately 1,980 U.S. flag and 9,593 foreign flag self-propelled vessels called at U.S. ports in 1992.

Non-Self-Propelled Vessels The total number of non-self-propelled vessels is shown in Table B&hyph;6. Of the 31,017 non-self propelled vessels, 87 percent are dry cargo barges, 13 percent are tanker barges, and less than 1 percent are railroad car floats. Nearly 86 percent of all non-self-propelled vessels in the United States operate on the domestic river and intracoastal waterway system and carry nearly all of the waterborne cargo transported on the inland waterways. Thirteen percent of the non-self-propelled vessels (4,158 vessels) in the United States operate on the Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts. The remaining 1 percent of non-self-propelled vessels operate in the Great Lakes.

Containers and Container-Carrying Vessels Over recent years, there has been an increase in the volume of containerized cargo handled. Containers are large, standard size metal boxes, equipped with corner castings, into which cargo is packed for shipment. Containers are designed to be moved with common handling equipment enabling economical, high-speed intermodal transfers in large units between ships, railcars, truck chassis, and barges, using a minimum of labor. The container, therefore, serves as the transfer unit rather than the cargo contained therein. Most containers in the U.S. inventory are either 20-foot (6.1 m) containers (56 percent) or 40-foot containers (12.2 m) (42 percent). Containerships are vessels equipped with permanent container cells. They have little or no space for other types of cargo. Partial containerships are multi-purpose ships where one or more, but not all, compartments are fitted with permanent container cells. The remaining compartments are used for other types of cargo. Several other types of vessels also carry containers. Table B-7 presents the number of liner service container-carrying vessels calling at U.S. ports by type of vessel, flag of vessel (U.S. or foreign), and container capacity.

Vessels in liner service operate on fixed routes to advertised ports on published schedules. As shown in the table, 1,020 container-carrying liner service vessels with a total container capacity of approximately 1.7 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) called at U.S. ports in 1992. Virtually all containerships, partial containerships, bulk/containerships, RO RO/containerships and barge carriers are in liner service, and essentially, the entire container capacity of these types of vessels are accounted for in liner services. Break bulk freighters and RO-RO ships also carry containers. Although RO-RO ships are generally in liner service, break bulk carriers are not. Data on the number and container capacity of non-liner service break bulk carriers were unavailable. However, based on the proportion of container traffic accounted for by break bulk freighters, the estimated number of voyages made annually to the United States by these vessels, and their average container capacity, Kearney/Centaur estimated that 544 non-liner service break bulk freighters with a container capacity of 78,336 containers called at U.S. ports in 1992. Combining the number of liner service and non-liner service container-carrying vessels, OSHA therefore estimates that a total of 1,564 container-carrying vessels, with an overall container capacity of 1.76 million TEUs, call annually at U.S. ports [1]. Population at Risk Based on employment data from the Bureau of the Census and OSHA inspection data, approximately 93,427 workers are estimated to be affected by the Longshoring standard, over 58 percent of which are employed in SIC 4491. Kearney/Centaur estimated that about 70,140 of these workers would also be covered by the Marine Terminals standard, 78 percent of which are in SIC 4491. Estimates of full-time equivalent workers, as well as the population at risk are shown in Table B-8, by industry and in Table B-9, by region.

Gang Sizes and Cargo Handling Rates Table B-10 summarizes the average stevedoring crew sizes by type of operation. These estimates include both off-the-dock and dockside workers directly involved in the loading or unloading of cargo. Average cargo handling rates are also presented. Based on cargo handling rates, and the types and total tonnages of cargo handled, Kearney/Centaur estimated that approximately 54 million person-hours of exposure occur during longshoring loading and unloading activities, annually.

Wages Wages of longshore workers vary among regions and ports. Two primary factors account for this variation. First, local union contractual agreements vary in wage rates, holidays, and other rules or benefits which affect the wages and earnings of longshore workers. Second, the number of hours worked per year varies by port and region, resulting in variations in overtime wage payments. The average national wage rate of longshore workers, including overtime and benefits, is estimated to be $40.30 per hour. The average supervisor wage rate, including overtime and benefits, is estimated at $50.78 [1]. Operating Revenues and Shipping Costs Statistics on shipping costs were estimated based on vessel operating revenue data for domestic water carriers compiled by The U.S. Department of Transportation. Table B-11 presents operating revenues and tonnage data, by region, for 1990. As shown, operating revenues were nearly $3.0 billion for Coastal regions, $2.9 billion for Inland waterways, and $0.6 billion for the Great Lakes region. The operating revenues per ton of freight hauled were $10.27, $4.57 and $5.33, respectively. The cost for shipping a 40-foot (12.0 m) container with FAK (freight-of-all-kinds) worth $100,000 and weighing 10 long tons from New York to Rotterdam was estimated to range from $277.40 to $300.50 per long ton. The cost for the same shipment from Los Angeles to Tokyo was estimated to range from $243.60 to $288.30 per long ton [1].

C. Technological Feasibility and Costs of Compliance Technological Feasibility All of the requirements of the proposed standard can be met using currently available equipment, facilities, tests, inspections, supplies, and work practices. OSHA's analysis of the technological requirements of each provision indicates that none of the proposed provisions will create any problem of supply or availability of equipment, facilities, or personnel. Although the proposed standard will require the expenditure of resources to fully comply, there are no technological constraints associated with full compliance with the proposed regulation. Costs of Compliance This section presents preliminary estimates of costs that will be incurred by firms to come into compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards. The costs of the proposed revisions to the two standards are shown in Table C&hyph;1. Table C&hyph;1_Summary of Total Compliance Costs (1993 Dollars) 1Rule 1Total First-Year Costs 1Total Annualized Costs* 29 CFR part 1918: Longshoring $4,088,445 $1,755,773 29 CFR part 1917: Marine Terminals 535,585 20,099 s,s,s TOTAL $4,624,029 $1,775,872 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis. * Annualized cost is the sum of annualized capital costs and recurring annual costs. Total first-year costs are estimated to amount to less than $4.7 million. After the first year, affected establishments will incur costs of approximately $1.8 million, annually. These costs were estimated using a baseline of full compliance with existing rules and estimates of current practice for those cost elements not required under previous standards 2 . OSHA welcomes comments on the preliminary costs and assumptions presented in this analysis. 2 This is not intended to suggest that all establishments are fully complying with existing regulations. However, the costs presented in this analysis reflect only those costs which are attributable to to proposed revisions to existing regulations. Methodology A side-by-side comparison of the proposed and existing rules was conducted to identify revisions to the existing rules. In addition, a profile of current industry practices was developed to enable estimates of incremental compliance costs to be made. The data used in this preliminary analysis of compliance costs were obtained from three studies conducted in 1986, 1989 and in 1994 by OSHA's contractor, Kearney/Centaur. In 1986 and 1989, analyses were performed on proposed requirements identified as changes to existing standards. These studies were conducted through field visits and telephone surveys of U.S. ports. The 1994 study was conducted to update information collected in previous studies and to collect information on the impact of proposed revisions made recently to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards. Efforts included interviews with industry officials to gather information on key cost issues, and calls to equipment manufacturers, suppliers, and professional service providers. Three general types of costs were identified: first-year costs, capital costs, and recurring annual costs. First-year costs are training and workplace analysis costs that which are expected to be incurred in the first year after promulgation of a final rule. Capital costs are costs for equipment with a working life of more than one year. Recurring annual costs are costs that will be incurred each year after promulgation of a final rule. The majority of compliance costs are expected to be borne directly by stevedoring companies, although vessel operators may incur some short-term costs. Revisions to 29 CFR part 1918: Longshoring This section presents preliminary cost estimates attributable to proposed revisions to OSHA's Longshoring standard. Provisions for which costs are not specifically addressed are not expected to have any incremental costs beyond those estimated for workplace analysis and general training. General First-Year Costs Proposed revisions to the existing Longshoring standard will result in general costs for workplace analysis and training. Total first-year costs for these activities are estimated at $1,607,563, and will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms. Workplace Analysis Workplace analysis involves evaluating an establishment to determine what needs to be done to achieve compliance with the proposed rule. Preliminary costs for this activity are estimated using the hourly wage rate of a safety consultant or safety engineer. The average hourly fee for a safety consultant is estimated to be $87.50, based on a range of $50 to $125 per hour [1]. The average time per establishment to have a safety consultant conduct such an analysis is estimated to be about an hour and a half [1]. This yields an average cost per facility of $131.25. The total first-year workplace analysis cost across all 3,700 affected establishments is estimated to be $485,625. This cost will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms. Training First-year costs will be necessary to train supervisors on the new requirements of the proposed rule. No recurring annual training costs are estimated since interviews with industry officials indicated that longshore supervisors receive regular safety training, and training in new requirements will replace safety training related to the existing rule. Kearney/Centaur field visits, and telephone interviews with longshore safety experts and industry officials revealed that supervisors will assure implementation of proposed requirements. No additional training time will be required for longshore workers. The proposed rule will result in three types of training: (1) general training in new requirements; (2) additional safety training for RO-RO and containerized operations; and (3) accident prevention proficiency training for supervisors overseeing five or more workers. The costs of additional training for container and RO-RO operations, and accident prevention proficiency training will be discussed under the appropriate subparts. OSHA assumes that first-year supplementary general training will be required to familiarize supervisors with the new requirements of the proposed rule. The number of supervisors that will need general training is estimated using a 10 to 1 employee to supervisor ratio. As discussed in the Industry Profile, approximately 93,427 workers are estimated to be at risk. Hence, 9,343 supervisors are estimated to require general training. Kearney/Centaur estimated that less than one hour of training, in addition to regular safety training, will be necessary to train each supervisor. Using an average supervisor wage rate of $50.78, the total first-year cost of supervisor time to receive general training is estimated at $474,438. In addition to the cost of supervisor training time, the cost to provide safety instruction is estimated. The fee for an instructor is estimated to be about $175 per hour of training [1]. The total cost for general safety instruction is estimated at $647,500. Subpart C: Means of Access Most of the proposed revisions to this subpart are not expected to impose additional costs on affected establishments. For example, proposed requirements for portable ladders are already addressed in the existing Marine Terminals standard. Since portable ladders used on the vessel are typically the same ladders used on the dock, no incremental costs are expected to be incurred. No additional costs are expected to result from requiring 6 inches (15.2 cm) or more of clearance in the back of ladder rungs. This requirement can be met using portable ladders, which are currently available on-site [1]. The proposed requirement for 6 inch (15.2 cm) sideboards on dockboards and ramps is expected to impose additional costs on stevedoring firms. Based on Kearney/Centaur interviews with regional industry representatives, approximately 1,070 ramps will need to be retrofitted at a unit cost of $1,000 [1]. The incremental capital cost for this provision is estimated at $1,070,000. Subpart D: Working Surfaces In the existing rule, 29 CFR 1918.32(b) requires fall protection for workers exposed to fall hazards at the edge of a hatch section or stowed cargo over 8 feet (2.4 m) high. Although changes to the regulatory text are being proposed for clarification purposes, the proposed language does not impose additional responsibilities upon employers. Hence, no incremental costs are attributed to this provision. This is consistent with court interpretations, as found by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission in its decision of October 24, 1979, OSHRC Docket No. 15242 concerning 1918.32(b) citation of Seattle Crescent Container Service, and the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in Long Beach Container Terminal Inc. v. OSHRC and Brock, February 23, 1987. Proposed revisions to Subpart D also include requirements for ``walking sticks'' (floating walking and working surfaces) for employees working logs out of the water. However, local rules in ports affected by this requirement currently include these requirements, and affected establishments are already in compliance [1]. Subpart E: Opening and Closing Hatches The proposed rule includes several revisions to this subpart. Proposed revisions impose more restrictions on working spaces along coamings, more flexibility on covering hatches with tarpaulins, and more flexibility on securing hatch covers. The proposed revisions would also require that all unsecured materials be removed before moving hatch covers. Such changes in work practices are not expected to result in incremental costs other than first-year costs for general training discussed earlier in this chapter [1]. Subpart F: Ship's Cargo Handling Gear Proposed revisions to this subpart address changes in work practices. Costs attributed to changes in work practices are accounted for in the general first-year cost estimates. Subpart G: Cargo Handling Gear and Equipment Other Than Ship's Gear This subpart covers all employer-provided gear and equipment used in longshoring operations aboard vessels. The majority of the gear used aboard vessels is also used on the dock. To the extent that proposed revisions to the Longshoring standard covering this gear are addressed by the existing Marine Terminals standard, no incremental costs are estimated. The proposed rule would require that all special stevedoring gear purchased or fabricated 90 days or more after publication of a final rule, and having a safe working load of 5 short tons or over, be certified by an OSHA accredited agency in accordance with 29 CFR part 1919. Most gear covered under this subpart is either also used on the dock and therefore, already required to be certified under 29 CFR 1917.50, or already certified prior to purchase by the manufacturer. Although situations do arise in which special gear is manufactured and used only on the vessel, such occurrences are rare and the overall cost to affected establishments is expected to be minimal. Two requirements, however, are expected to impose costs on affected establishments. The proposed requirements for the quadrennial testing of special stevedoring gear and the lockout/tagout of powered conveyors are expected to generate compliance costs. OSHA assumes that only the 746 establishments classified under SIC 4491 will be affected by the proposed requirement for quadrennial testing of special gear and equipment. Testing is estimated to take an average of five hours per affected establishment. Assuming that a designated person with an average wage rate of $40.30 will do the testing, the average cost per establishment is estimated to be $201.50 every four years, or $50.38 annually. The total annual cost for affected establishments to comply with this provision is estimated at $37,583 [1]. Compliance costs are also expected to result from the proposed revision requiring the lockout/tagout of powered conveyors. Those conveyors with master shut-off switches used only aboard vessels and not on the dock will be affected. Kearney/Centaur estimated that existing switches on a total of 60 powered conveyors would need to be replaced by general duty 240 volt/100 amp, 3 pole, fused, lockable safety switches. The unit cost for switch replacement, including installation charges, is estimated to be $315 each ($130 for materials cost, $112 direct labor, $73 overhead and other charges) [1]. OSHA estimates that the total capital cost associated with the lockout/tagout of powered conveyors is $18,900. This cost will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms. Subpart H: Handling Cargo Nine proposed revisions to the existing rule were identified as substantive changes to the existing rule. Vertical Lifting of Containers The proposed rule requires that, when containers are being hoisted by the top fittings, lifting forces must be applied vertically from at least four such fittings. Since container gantry cranes provide vertical lifts, only non-container cranes will be affected. Stevedores using non-container cranes currently use either box spreaders, or wires and hooks to lift containers. The use of box spreaders would provide vertical lifts. Approximately 423 non-container gantry cranes are used to lift containers. However, box spreaders would only need to be purchased for 8 to 20 percent of these cranes [1]. Approximately one 20 foot (6.1 m) box spreader and one 40 foot (12.2 m) box spreader will need to be purchased for 59 cranes (14 percent of non-container cranes). Kearney/Centaur estimated, based on an interview with a box spreader manufacturer, that a 20-foot (6.1 m) box spreader costs about $8,800 and a 40-foot (12.2 m) box spreader costs about $9,800. The total cost per crane to purchase one 20-foot (6.1 m) box spreader and one 40-foot (12.2 m) box spreader is, therefore, estimated at $18,600 ($8,800 + $9,800). Thus, the total capital cost that will be incurred by stevedoring companies to comply with this provision is estimated at $1,101,492 [1]. Prohibiting Work On Top of Containers to the Extent Feasible The proposed rule would eliminate work on top of container stacks, to the extent feasible, through the use of engineering controls. Compliance with this proposed requirement is considered feasible, for most operations, when container gantry cranes are used to move containers. To secure stacked containers, twistlocks are placed in the corner castings of each container. When manual twistlocks are used, workers are placed, usually by crane, on top of each container to place or remove (cone or decone) twistlocks. The use of semi-automatic twistlocks (SATLs) and above-deck cell guides would eliminate the need for workers to go atop containers for the purpose of coning or deconing. These engineering controls would greatly reduce the time spent on top of containers and thus, reduce the fall hazards. The use of such controls would also eliminate the need to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for the purposes of coning and deconing. Kearney/Centaur conducted a time-motion study comparing the use of SATLs with the use of fall protection using tie-off. Through field visits to eight ports, Kearney/Centaur observed various container operations on different types of vessels. Activities that directly affect the total time to complete a project (activities on the critical path) were identified, and the average time to complete each of these activities was estimated. Operations that delay the crane are activities on the critical path. The study demonstrated that the use of SATLs would result in significant decreases in crane delay time, since workers would no longer need to be placed on each container to cone or decone. This finding is consistent with other studies conducted on the use of SATLs [1, Appendix E]. The unit cost of a SATL is about $20 more than the cost of a conventional twistlock. Thus, the incremental cost per SATL is estimated to be $20 [1]. An estimated 177 U.S.-owned vessels and 350 foreign-owned vessels will need to purchase SATLs. The total annualized investment cost to purchase SATLs is estimated at about $2 million for U.S. vessel operators and $4 million for foreign operators. The use of SATLs is expected to result in cost savings to vessel operators, as well as to stevedores, in terms of productivity increases. The total dollar value of the cost savings depends on the time savings per vessel, the vessel configuration, the number of containers carried, the number of container cranes used to load or unload the vessel, and the number of trips made to U.S. ports. In each case, as analyzed in Kearney/Centaur's study, cost savings exceed the annualized cost of purchasing SATLs. Even under the worst case scenario, annual productivity increases more than offset the annualized investment cost of the SATLs. The use of SATLs also results in reduced damage to containers. Conventional twistlocks are often thrown or dropped onto the tops of containers, often damaging them. Since SATLs are placed and removed on the dock, such damage would be avoided. Furthermore, interviews with industry officials revealed that shipping lines are already rapidly converting to the use of SATLs. Approximately 47 to 55 percent of all containerships calling at U.S. ports are currently using SATLs. An estimated 22 to 26 percent of U.S. flag containerships and 74 to 78 percent of foreign flag containerships currently use SATLs. In addition, major shipping lines are currently in the process of fully converting to the use of SATLs [1]. In conclusion, based on the Kearney/Centaur study, the annual productivity gains realized as a result of using of SATLs are expected to exceed the annualized investment cost to purchase SATLs. OSHA requests additional data and comments on this issue. Certification of Fall Protection Systems The certification of fall protection systems used in container operations is also expected to result in compliance costs. The proposed rule would require that all fall protection systems be certified by a registered professional engineer as being capable of sustaining at least twice the potential impact of an employee's fall. Based on Kearney/Centaur interviews with industry officials, compliance with this provision would require, on average, one annual certification per establishment involved in container operations. Each certification is expected to take about two hours. Approximately 277 establishments are estimated to be involved in container operations [1]. The services of a registered professional engineer to conduct the required testing and provide certification are estimated to cost about $50 per hour, or $100 per establishment, annually. In addition, there may be a $200 documentation fee and a 15 percent administrative surcharge. This results in an average cost of $345 per establishment, and a total annual recurring cost of $95,565 for stevedoring firms. Secondary Attachments for Safety Cages The proposed standard requires the use of secondary attachments for safety cages attached to container gantry cranes which are used to hoist employees. Few safety cages have secondary means of attachment. The installation of padeyes on cages to allow them to be attached to the spreader by chains and hooks would satisfy this requirement. Approximately 75 to 100 safety cages are currently in use, 90 percent of which lack secondary means of attachment [1]. Applying this percentage to 88 safety cages (the midpoint of the estimated range of safety cages in use) yields an estimate of 79 cages that will need to be retrofitted. The installation of padeyes is estimated to cost $200 per safety cage. No costs are attributed to the purchase of hooks and chains since these items are readily available from existing inventories of equipment. The total capital cost to comply with this provision is estimated at $15,840. This cost would is likely to be borne by stevedoring companies [1]. Marking of Load Capacities on RO-RO Ramps The proposed provision requiring that RO-RO ramps be marked with their load capacities is expected to impose first-year costs primarily on vessel operators. Field visits and interviews with industry representatives indicated that virtually none of the vessels have load capacities marked on their ramps. The Bureau of the Census reported that 147 RO-RO vessels called at U.S. ports in 1992. Approximately 120 of these are RO-RO car carriers, and 27 are heavy capacity RO-RO vessels. On average, car carriers have about four ramps each and heavy capacity RO-RO vessels have 1.5 ramps each. Thus, an estimated 521 ramps would need to be marked. Industry officials indicated that this procedure would require about 0.5 hour per vessel to obtain the necessary information, and 0.5 hour to mark each ramp. Thus, a total of 334 labor hours would be required. Using a labor rate of $40.30, the total estimated first-year cost for vessel operators to comply with this requirement is $13,460. Separation of Vehicles and Pedestrians on RO-RO Ramps The proposed rule also requires that pedestrians and vehicles be physically separated on RO-RO ramps. When no physical separation is present or feasible, a signal person would be required to direct traffic, disallowing concurrent use. Although some heavy capacity RO-RO ramps have pedestrian walkways built into them, most are relatively wide and are often used concurrently by pedestrians and vehicles. For car carriers, ramps are narrow and many do not have room to designate both a pedestrian walkway and a car lane. Discussions with car carrier foremen indicated that, currently, a gang member is assigned the duty of directing traffic and coordinating the movement of vehicles. Consequently, no incremental costs are expected to be incurred for a signal person. However, decreases in productivity may result since vehicles, which would normally be driven onto ramps when pedestrians are present, would have to wait until all pedestrians clear the ramp. Kearney/Centaur indicated that productivity decreases would be in the form of additional personnel rather than vessel delays. Based on the number of vehicles imported to and exported from the United States each year, the probability that pedestrians and vehicles would concurrently use a ramp, and the average delay time that would result for each incident, Kearney/Centaur estimated that this proposed requirement would result in a total annual delay time of about 2,178.7 hours [1]. Applying an average longshore worker wage rate of $40.30 to the total time delay yields a recurring annual cost of about $87,801. Marking Flat Bed and Low Boy Trailers The proposed rule requires that flat bed and low boy trailers (mafis) be marked with their load capacities. Kearney/Centaur concluded that the 307 establishments involved in container and RO-RO operations will be affected by this requirement, 80 percent of which are already in compliance [1]. To mark all mafis would take about eight hours per establishment. Using an average hourly wage rate of $40.30, the first-year incremental cost of this requirement is estimated at $19,795. High Visibility Vests The proposed rule would require that high visibility vests be used during RO-RO and container operations. Kearney/Centaur estimated that one vest would be required, annually, for each affected worker [1]. OSHA estimates that about 75 percent (40,963 workers) of SIC 4491 workers are involved in container or RO-RO operations. The average unit cost of a high visibility vest is estimated to be $6.50 [1]. Therefore, the annual recurring cost for high visibility vests is estimated at $266,260. Additional Training in Container and RO-RO Safety Since there are several revisions proposed for container and RO-RO operations, additional training is expected to be needed. OSHA estimates that 75 percent of longshore workers employed in SIC 4491 (40,963 workers) engage in either container or RO-RO operations or both. Assuming one supervisor will need to be trained for every 10 workers at risk, 4,096 supervisors will need additional training. Additional training in container and RO-RO operations is not expected to exceed 0.5 hour [1]. Applying an hourly supervisor wage rate of $50.78 yields a first-year cost of approximately $103,997. A first-year cost to provide safety instruction is also estimated. An estimated 307 establishments will need instructors for container and RO-RO safety training [1]. Using an hourly instruction fee of $175 per hour of training provided, the estimated instruction cost is $26,863. The total first-year cost for additional container and RO-RO safety training is estimated to be $130,860, and will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms. Subpart I: General Working Conditions Illumination According to industry officials, most lighting situations meet the proposed requirement of 5 footcandles (54 lux) of illumination. The existing rule requires that ``adequate'' lighting be provided at all times. OSHA assumes that establishments not using at least 5 footcandles (54 lux) of lighting would be in violation of the existing rule. Thus, no incremental costs are estimated for this provision. Sanitation The proposed standard includes specifications on the number of toilets that would need to be available to longshore workers. Kearney/Centaur interviews with industry representatives indicated that current practice already meets this proposed requirement, with the exception of certain situations in the Gulf region. Compliance with this requirement can be achieved through semi-monthly rentals of portable toilets at a rental cost of $65 each. The total recurring annual cost to comply with the proposed sanitation requirements is estimated to be $1,560 for stevedoring companies operating in the Gulf [1]. First Aid Kits The proposed rule would require that first aid kits be checked at least weekly and that contents be approved by a physician. Industry officials indicated that first aid kits currently in use are stocked on the basis of recommendations by first aid and safety professionals and are expected to already meet physicians' recommendations. Thus, kit contents are not expected to change as a result of proposed revisions. Incremental costs are expected to result in the form of labor time necessary to perform weekly checks of the contents of each kit. This procedure is not expected to take more than 5 minutes per week per establishment. Applying an average hourly wage rate of $40.30 yields an annual cost of $174.63 per establishment per year. The total recurring annual cost for all 3,700 establishments to comply with this requirement is estimated at $646,143. Stretchers Incremental costs are expected to result from the proposed requirement that stretchers be equipped with four sets of working patient restraints. Costs are estimated assuming that 25 percent of the affected workplaces would need to retrofit their stretchers. Approximately one stretcher per establishment would need to be retrofitted at an average cost of $400 each [1]. The total capital cost for this requirement is estimated at $370,000. Accident Prevention Proficiency Training for Supervisors The proposed rule would require that all supervisors overseeing more than five workers complete a course in accident prevention. This training is currently required under the Marine Terminals standard. Kearney/Centaur field visits indicated that approximately 75 percent of supervisors already receive accident prevention training [1]. Each course is estimated to take two hours. At an average supervisor wage rate of $50.78 per hour, the cost for 2,336 supervisors to receive this training is $237,244. The average fee to provide instruction is estimated to be $175 per hour of training. Assuming that 25 percent of the affected establishments (925 establishments) would require such training, the cost for instruction is estimated at $323,750 ($175 x 2 x 925). The total first-year cost for accident prevention proficiency training is, therefore, estimated to be $560,994 and is expected to be borne by stevedoring companies. In addition to first-year costs, annual recurring costs are expected to be incurred as a result of supervisor turnover. Kearney/Centaur estimated that the turnover rate for longshore supervisors is about five percent per year. The resulting annual cost of supervisor time is estimated at $11,883. The annual cost to provide instruction is $16,188, assuming that five percent of establishments would need such instruction. The recurring annual cost for accident prevention proficiency training is, therefore, estimated at $28,070. Subpart J: Personal Protective Equipment The proposed rule would broaden the existing scope to require that personal flotation devices be used in more situations where workers may be at risk of falling into the water. Since the existing rule already requires the use of personal flotation devices in the Gulf/Mississippi region, no incremental costs in addition to general training costs are expected to be incurred by establishments in this region. To estimate the number of flotation devices that would be needed, OSHA assumes that 50 percent of employees not working in the Gulf/Mississippi region (19,386 workers), would need personal flotation devices. The average unit cost per life vest meeting the required specifications is estimated at $55 [8]. Thus, the total capital cost to purchase personal flotation devices is estimated at $1,066,230. Summary As shown in Table C&hyph;2, the total first-year cost of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring standard is estimated at $4,088,445. After the first year, establishments will incur an estimated $1,755,773, annually.

Revisions to 29 CFR Part 1917: Marine Terminals Several of the proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard are not expected to generate any specific costs. Some of the costs of the proposed revisions are included in the cost analysis of the proposed Longshoring standard. For example, the first aid kits and stretchers used for workers aboard vessels are the same ones used in marine terminals. Also, Kearney/Centaur concluded, based on interviews with industry representatives, that many of the proposed requirements reflect current practices. For example, current industry practice prohibits riding the load and hoisting workers by hooks. In addition, industry officials indicated that lowering the 8-hour time-weighted average exposure limit of carbon monoxide from 50 ppm to 35 ppm would not be a problem. Compliance with most of the proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard can be met through workplace analysis and general training. Specific compliance costs are expected to be generated from the proposed requirement for seat belts in high speed container gantry cranes. First-Year Costs Costs for workplace analysis and general training are based on the assumption that 1,928 establishments and 70,140 workers (see Industry Profile), would be affected by proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard [1]. The total first-year cost for these activities is estimated at $515,485. Workplace Analysis Approximately one hour, on average, is estimated to be required for a safety consultant, familiar with the proposed rule, to evaluate an establishment. At an average fee of $87.50 per hour, the total estimated first-year cost for workplace analysis is $168,700 [1]. General Training One supervisor per every 10 workers (7,014 supervisors) would receive supplementary general training in the proposed new requirements. General training in the proposed requirements is estimated to take about 0.5 hour. Using an average supervisor wage rate of $50.78, the total first-year cost of supervisor time for additional training is estimated at $178,085. The cost per establishment to provide instruction, using an average fee of $175 per hour of training, is estimated at $168,700. Thus, the total first-year cost of general training is estimated at $346,785, and will most likely be borne by stevedoring firms. Seat Belts The proposed rule requires that seat belts be placed in the operators' seats of high-speed container gantry cranes. Kearney/Centaur estimated that 40 percent of the 411 container gantry cranes in U.S. ports are already equipped with chest harnesses. Based on interviews, the cost to retrofit one crane is estimated at $500. The total capital cost to retrofit 247 container cranes is estimated to be $123,500. Summary Proposed revisions to the Marine Terminals standard are estimated to result in first-year costs totalling $535,585 and annualized costs totalling $20,099 (Table C&hyph;3).

D. Benefits Introduction The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to reduce the numbers of injuries and fatalities in the marine cargo handling industry. Since affected workers are involved in both off-the-dock (covered under 29 CFR part 1918) and on-the-dock activities (covered under 29 CFR part 1917), separate analyses are presented on accidents that occur in each area of operation. Injuries and Fatalities As presented in the Industry Profile, approximately 87,951 full-time equivalent (FTE) longshore workers, based on a 1,436 hour work-year, are affected by the Longshoring standard. Approximately 67,974 of these workers are also covered by the Marine Terminals standard. About 54,617 of affected workers are employed in SIC 4491, while the others are employed in establishments classified under other industry sectors. A summary of injuries occurring among affected workers in the marine cargo handling industry is shown in Table D-1. As shown, a total of 18 fatalities and 7,593 injuries occurred among workers affected by the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards. Table D-1_Estimated Annual Number of Fatalities and Injuries Occurring Among Affected Workers 1Type of Incident 1Total Cases 1Off-the-Dock 1On-the-Dock Fatalities 18 10 8 Injuries 7,593 4,208 3,385 Non-Lost Workday Cases 2,903 1,609 1,294 Lost Workday Cases 4,690 2,599 2,091 Lost Workdays 182,442 101,109 81,332 Source: U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, Office of Regulatory Analysis, based on Kearney/Centaur [1, Chapter 5]. Injuries The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provided the 1991 injury rate for SIC 4491. This rate was 13.6 for every 100 FTE workers, based on a 2000 hour work-year [1]. The lost workday and non-lost workday injury rates per 100 FTE workers were 8.4 and 5.2, respectively. An average of 38.9 lost workdays occurred per lost workday injury. BLS also conducted a study of longshore-related injuries processed under the Federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act [9]. According to this study, 49 percent of longshore-related injuries occurred off the dock, while 51 percent occurred on the dock. Since BLS injury rates are per 100 FTE workers based on a 2,000 hour work-year, the number of FTE workers based on a 1,436 hour work-year must be converted to FTEs based on a 2,000-hour work-year. The conversion results in 63,148 FTE off-the-dock workers and 48,805 FTE on-the-dock workers. Off-the-Dock The number of off-the-dock injuries was estimated by applying 49 percent of the BLS injury rate to the 63,148 FTE off-the-dock workers (based on a 2,000 hour work-year). As a result, 4,208 annual injuries are estimated to occur off the dock. Of these, 2,599 are lost workday cases resulting in 101,109 lost workdays, and 1,609 are non-lost workday cases. On-the-Dock The number of FTE workers affected by the Marine Terminals standard, based on a 2,000 hour work-year, is 48,805. Applying 51 percent of the BLS injury rate to the 48,805 FTE workers on the dock yields 3,385 annual injuries occurring on the dock. Of these, 1,294 are non-lost workday cases and 2,091 are lost workday cases resulting in 81,332 lost workdays. Fatalities Although BLS did not provide a fatality rate for SIC 4491, data were available on the total of number of 1992 fatalities that occurred in SIC 4491. BLS indicated that 13 fatalities occurred among SIC 4491 workers [1]. Since 54,617 FTE workers (based on a 1,436 hour work-year) are estimated to be employed in SIC 4491, a fatality rate of 0.0238 per 100 FTE workers (based on a 1,436 hour work-year) was derived. Off-the-Dock To determine the number of off-the-dock fatalities occurring annually, 49 percent of the fatality rate was applied to the 87,951 FTE longshore workers (based on a 1,436 hour work-year). This results in 10 fatalities occurring, annually, off the dock. On-the-Dock To estimate the number of fatalities occurring among the population covered by the Marine Terminals standard, OSHA used 51 percent of the fatality rate estimated above. As a result, approximately eight fatalities are estimated to occur on the dock, annually. BENEFITS The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are expected to reduce many of the risks involved in marine cargo handling operations. Reductions in fatalities and injuries are expected as a result of proposed revisions to the two standards. In reviewing OSHA's first reports of serious accidents in the marine cargo handling industry, Kearney/Centaur estimated the percent of fatalities that would have been prevented by proposed revisions to the existing standards. Approximately 30 percent of off-the-dock fatalities and injuries could have been prevented through compliance with proposed requirements. Thus, an estimated 3 fatalities are expected to be prevented, annually, by the proposed requirements. In addition, an estimated 1,262 injuries would be prevented annually through compliance with proposed new requirements. Many additional fatalities and injuries would be prevented through full compliance with existing requirements retained in the proposed standards. Summary of Benefits All of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are likely to reduce the risk of injuries occurring in the marine cargo handling industry. The proposed new requirements are expected to prevent approximately 3 of the 18 fatalities and 1,262 of the 7,593 injuries occurring annually among affected workers. Approximately 779 lost workday injuries involving 30,303 lost workdays are expected to be prevented, annually. An additional 483 non-lost workday cases are also expected to be avoided. Many additional fatalities and injuries would likely be prevented through full compliance with existing requirements retained in the proposed standards. E. Economic Impacts Compliance with the requirements of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards are not expected to produce any significant adverse economic impacts. The costs that are imposed by the regulation should be a minimal burden on all affected establishments. The total annual revenues and profits associated with longshoring operations are approximately $7.8 billion and $388.9 million, respectively [1]. The total estimated costs of compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards rules are less than $4.7 million for the first year after promulgation of the final rules and less than $1.8 million annually, thereafter. Thus, the total first-year costs of compliance with the proposed revisions represent less than 0.06 percent of the revenues and 1.19 percent of the profits of the industry. Compliance costs for subsequent years represent less than 0.03 percent of revenues and less than 0.46 percent of profits. Current practices in the marine cargo handling industry indicate that the requirements of the proposed standard can generally be met without significant hardship. Many employers already comply with the proposed requirements and presumably are not imposing substantial disadvantages on themselves. Since stevedoring establishments engaging in similar cargo handling operations in the United States would be subject to the same regulations, no competitive disadvantages between industries or with regard to international trade are projected. Costs are expected to be passed through as an increase in the costs of cargo handling and shipping, and the effect on profits and prices should be negligible. The estimated compliance costs would represent an average increase in cost of less than 25 cents for shipping a loaded container in or out of U.S. ports, which costs an average of about $3000. On the whole, the costs of marine cargo handling operations for society would actually decrease as fewer accidents would mean less lost time and wages and fewer medical and legal resources necessary for a given amount of cargo shipping and handling. The estimated savings to society attributable to the prevention of injuries and fatalities would far outweigh the costs of preventing these incidents. According to the National Safety Council, the total costs associated with occupational injuries and deaths in 1992 were $115.9 billion, or an average cost of over $15,000 per case. This estimate includes wage and productivity losses, medical costs, administrative expenses, and other costs associated with accidents. The estimated benefits anticipated from proposed requirements include unquantifiable reductions in pain and suffering, plus estimated savings of over $18 million annually. REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (P.L. 96-353, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. )), OSHA has made an assessment of the impact of the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards, and has concluded that they would not have a significant impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The important criterion that governs a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is whether the proposed standards would impose significant costs upon small entities. ``Significance'' is determined by the effect upon profits, market share, and the entity's financial viability. In particular, the effect of the proposed revisions upon small entities relative to their effect upon large entities needs to be specifically evaluated. That is, OSHA must determine whether the proposed requirements would have a relatively greater negative effect upon small entities than they would have upon large entities, thereby putting small entities at a competitive disadvantage, and if so, whether there are ways to minimize any differentially adverse effects without increasing the risk to employees. If the costs of compliance are proportional to firm size and are insignificant to small firms, then there is no significant differential burden on small firms relative to that on large firms. In those cases involving large absolute costs (typically capital equipment costs), financing may be more difficult to obtain for small entities than for larger entities and in such cases of economies of scale in compliance, the burden on small firms will be greater than the burden on large firms. The proposed changes to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards, however, require minimal capital expenditures and generally impose costs that are proportional to firm size and the amount of business done. In addition, these costs would be a minimal component of the overall costs of operations. As a result, small entities would not be put at a competitive disadvantage to large entities due to these compliance costs. Thus, OSHA concluded that the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards would not have a significant adverse impact upon a substantial number of small entities. F. Other Impacts Impact Upon International Trade OSHA determined that compliance with the proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards would not have any measurable impact upon international trade. The compliance costs are minimal and are not expected to affect exports, imports, or international competitiveness. To the extent that compliance with the proposed rule would increase cargo handling efficiency and reduce the number of injuries and fatalities associated with these operations, shipping costs may be reduced and result in a general increase in the competitiveness of U.S. firms.

Environmental Impact The proposed revisions to the Longshoring and Marine Terminals standards have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR Part 1500), and DOL NEPA Procedures (29 CFR Part 11). No significant negative impact is foreseen on air, water or soil quality, plant or animal life, the use of land or sea, or other aspects of the environment. X. Recordkeeping Requirements Part 1320 of title 5 of the CFR sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The proposed Longshoring standard requires the employer to allow OSHA access to records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of that Act. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response to allow OSHA compliance officers access to the employer's records. Send comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, Room N&hyph;1301, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503. XI. State Plan Requirements Those of the 25 states with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans whose plans cover the issues of maritime safety and health must revise their existing standard within six months of the publication date of the final standard or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective'' as the revised Federal standard. Currently five states (California, Minnesota, Oregon, Vermont and Washington) with their own state plans cover private sector on-shore maritime activities. Federal OSHA enforces maritime standards offshore in all states and provides onshore coverage of maritime activities in Federal OSHA states and in the following state Plan States: Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut 3 , Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York 4 , North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Virgin Islands, and Wyoming (all states with state plans must also extend coverage to state and local government employees engaged in maritime activities.) 3 Plan covers only state and local government employees. 4 Plan covers only state and local government employees. XII. Federalism The standard has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy options, consult with States prior to taking any actions that would restrict State policy options, and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. Additionally, the Order provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the agency to do so. Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt State laws relating to issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety or health standards. Under the OSH Act a State can avoid preemption only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Plan-States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards. The Federal standards on longshoring and marine terminal operations address hazards which are not unique to any one state or region of the country. Nonetheless, those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSHA Act would not be preempted by this final regulation and would be able to deal with special, local conditions within the framework provided by this performance-oriented standard while ensuring that their standards are at least as effective as the Federal standard.

Any party who has not substantially complied with the above requirement may be limited to a ten-minute presentation and may be requested to return for questioning at a later time. Any party who has not filed a notice of intention to appear may be allowed to testify for no more than 10 minutes as time permits, at the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge, but will not be allowed to question witnesses. Notice of intention to appear, testimony and evidence will be available for inspection and copying at the Docket Office at the address above. Conduct and Nature of Hearing The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding will be resolved. The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which impede or protract the rulemaking process. Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally will be decided so as to favor development of the record. The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that 1911.4 specifies the Assistant Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternative procedures to expedite proceedings or for other good cause. The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation on the merits of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing proceeds at a reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911 including the powers: 1. To regulate the course of the proceedings; 2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters; 3. To confine the presentations to the matters pertinent to the issues raised; 4. To regulate the conduct of those present at the hearing by appropriate means; 5. In the Judge's discretion, to question and permit the questioning of any witnesses and to limit the time for questioning; and 6. In the Judge's discretion, to keep the record open for a reasonable, stated time (known as the post-hearing comment period) to receive written information and additional data, views and arguments from any person who has participated in the oral proceedings. OSHA recognizes that there may be interested persons or organizations who, through their knowledge of the subject matter or their experience in the field, would wish to endorse or support the whole proposal or certain provisions of the proposal. OSHA welcomes such supportive comments, including any pertinent data and cost information which may be available, in order that the record of this rulemaking will present a balanced picture of public response on the issues involved.

The British Geological Survey, which advises the island's government, said its reading of preliminary data from the two surveys suggested the region had a good potential for finding oil. Confirmation, however, would require exploratory drilling. Mr Nigel Fannin, principal geologist in the survey's petroleum geology group, based in Edinburgh, said the data suggested a sedimentary basin of potential oil-bearing rocks of 200,000 sq km around the island, compared with 160,000 sq km of such formations in the British North Sea. 'We have been very encouraged by what we have seen,' he added. The two seismic surveys concentrated on areas to the south, west and the north of the islands, where the water is shallower than to the east. Mr Fannin said the rocks and geological formations both appeared similar to those of the North Sea. Other conditions would also be similar: the water was 500 metres deep or less, and the sea state and weather would be similar to that experienced in the northern zones of the North Sea. However, Britain's Foreign Office played down the significance of the findings. It said full seismic data would only become available next year and many further steps would be needed before it was known whether commercial quantities of oil existed. Mr Fannin said the data should be complete by early next year, and the survey expected to be in a position to advise the island government on licensing for exploratory drilling by next summer. A licensing regime has yet to be established and remains a sensitive issue, with the sovereignty of the islands still disputed between Britain and Argentina.

GENERAL MARTIN Balza, Malvinas veteran and Argentina's army chief, sits in his panelled military headquarters in Buenos Aires, fingering four British Pounds 1 notes as we talk about the Falklands War ten years ago. The money represents half his pay as a prisoner of war after he surrendered his artillery position outside Port Stanley to the British forces. The general smiles at the memory of those days when, as a lieutenant colonel, he was short- changed by an English soldier for a tube of toothpaste and a Coca-Cola. But he is not bitter. Argentina, he concedes, was destined to lose because of the incompetence of her former rulers. Back in March 1982, when I was in Buenos Aires covering the war for the FT, Argentina's then army chief and President, General Leopoldo Galtieri was not a person I wanted to meet unprotected. His regime's way of dealing with opponents was similar to that of Nazi Germany. More than 8,000 people, some foreigners, had 'disappeared' since the coup which brought him to power in 1976. I will never forget, just a few days before the Falklands war, watching an old woman, with shopping bag and walking stick, being surrounded and beaten senseless by heavily armed police. By chance, she had strayed into the first big demonstration against the regime. Galtieri had ordered it to be repressed with sabres, gas canisters, long truncheons and live bullets. Yet when Argentina invaded the Falklands, Galtieri became a national hero. Now ten years later, after the expenditure of 1,000 lives and enough cash to make each islander very rich, history has pushed aside both Galtieri and the woman who defeated him. Margaret Thatcher, whose defiance rang across the world, and helped to deliver a resounding victory to the Conservative party in 1983, walks sadly from the main political arena next month, almost at the anniversary of her military triumph. She also was rejected from the leadership of her country, as heroic memories of the struggle began to fade. Yet the questions remain, was it necessary and was it worth the cost? From Balza's office, at least, it seems the greatest benefit was reaped by Argentina, which escaped a vicious tyranny and brought its generals under political control. Did Britain also deliver a lesson which Argentina (if not the world) will never forget? Even now, a monument outside the army headquarters in Buenos Aires states that the Malvinas were, are, and always will be Argentine. But Balza declares: 'I don't see that there is any possibility of another armed conflict with Britain. We are living in a different world.' It seemed, when I stood in the Falklands a few days later under the union flag by 15 military graves at San Carlos, that the British Government believes him. All was as quiet as if there had never been a landing of troops, or a frenzied air attack on transports and frigates in that famous sound at the north west of the main island. Now only low-flying upland geese and seagulls disturb the stillness. The nearby military camp lies abandoned -a few empty cabins and a couple of jerry cans. Linda Anderson, owner of the recently opened Blue Beach Lodge nearby, complains that the Ministry of Defence can no longer afford to transport many soldiers to rest in her bed and breakfast. British officials say the forces still stationed on the islands are enough to defend them. Even so, the UK now spends only Pounds 69m a year on the defence of the islands, less than 7 per cent of the rate of spending in the three years after the war. (Even the present sum, however, could provide each islander with a Pounds 30,000 per year pension). Although the Falklands now boasts a large and fully-equipped military airport and three highly sensitive radar stations, the combined military presence has been reduced to half a squadron of Phantom aircraft (the Harriers have long since departed), some half a dozen aerial transport units, a company of less than 200 infantry, a frigate and a naval patrol vessel. One former British marine on the islands said that if it wanted to, Argentina could recapture the Falklands in 24 hours, for example by landing special forces from a submarine at night and taking out the radars and the phantoms on the ground. But nobody in Buenos Aires seems even to be thinking of such a plan. One reason is that British intelligence has greatly improved. Ten years ago this week, the UK was apparently unaware of a series of key meetings between General Galtieri and an officer attached to the Chiefs of Staff, General Mario Benjamin Menendez. At one such meeting, while an Argentine foreign minister was still going through the motions of diplomacy, Menendez was informed that a secret decision had been taken by the military junta to invade the islands. According to Menendez, Galtieri dismissed any suggestion that this would provoke a big international reaction. 'Menendez', Galtieri said, 'that is none of your business . . . it's the junta's problem and no one else's. I just want you to think about being a military governor.' Two weeks later the Argentines overran the token force of marines on the islands. In Buenos Aires, civilians, including some whose relatives had been tortured and killed, poured through the streets waving flags and bringing Galtieri to the balcony of the presidential palace to rapturous applause. Thatcher responded by sending a taskforce of 30,000 men and scores of ships, the biggest UK naval operation since the Second World War. Within two months, on the May 21, the first British troops were wading ashore on the rocky gravel beach that lies just below Linda Anderson's Blue Beach lodge. On June 14, Argentine troops surrendered at Port Stanley. The battle for the Falklands has been described by some military experts as a small colonial war. But the images that linger are those of high human drama which for a while gripped the attention of the world: they include the sinking of the battleship cruiser Belgrano with the loss of more than 400 lives in freezing South Atlantic seas, aerial dogfights of extraordinary skill and daring, the burning hulks of British battleships, and the dejected faces of the wounded and the defeated. Of the 1000 men killed in the campaign more than 800 were Argentines. But in Argentina, as the tenth anniversary approaches, the fallen are remembered with muted emotions. Jorge Lanata, the 31-year-old editor of Pagina 12, one of the country's most popular newspapers, says: 'Three years ago we ran a series on the war. It was treated with total indifference by our readers. Many of them supported the invasion, but they are now silenced by a sense of guilt. They look at the veterans as if they were ghosts.' Yet some Malvinas veterans who, like Balza, survived the postwar purge are now in positions of command in a radically altered armed force. Comodoro Gustavo Justo, for example, a former Mirage 5 fighter pilot in the attack on San Carlos Bay, is today Chief of Operational Planning under a civilian ministry of defence. On May 21, 1982 Justo led the first big attack on the British beachhead, flying low over the waters of the South Atlantic to avoid radar detection and leaving himself with the minimum fuel necessary to return to base. Justo narrowly escaped with his life, ejecting from his aircraft at 950 kms per hour, after being shot down by a British Harrier jet, equipped with the most modern air-to-air missiles provided by the US. He was only 1 1/2 miles short of his target. A fellow pilot and best friend was killed. Badly injured and suffering from concussion, Justo lay in a shepherd's hut for several days. He was eventually found by an Argentine helicopter team and shared a field hospital tent with a wounded RAF pilot. 'The Englishman said 'what a shit of a war. My parents are old and I was going to get married.' But I thought to myself: not only am I married but I know what I'm fighting for.' Ten years on, Justo is much less sure. 'I have known how horrific war can be . . .There are peaceful options. That is what I am telling my children. It is a lesson that was not passed on to me by my superiors when we fought.' Justo, Balza and the new men at the top have presided over a sharp contraction of the Argentine armed force, squeezed by budgetary cuts and public indifference. They also perceive that after the Gulf War, a coup in Buenos Aires - let alone an attack on the Falklands - could no longer be sure to escape an international response. Indeed, the Argentine military that defied UN resolutions, today takes part in the UN's global peacekeeping exercises. More remarkably, it also exchanges information with British forces on movements in the South Atlantic. These big changes in Argentina seem, however, to have escaped the notice of most of the 2,100 islanders. As military spending declines, their improved prosperity depends, partly at least, on Argentina's new policies of fishery conservation and non-belligerence. But for many islanders the traumas of the war have not healed, perhaps understandably in view of the large areas near Port Stanley still made deadly by Argentine mines. Stuart Wallace, for example, who studied in Argentina and lives with his Argentine wife in Port Stanley, says that while Buenos Aires claims the islands: 'The price of dealing with Argentina is potentially enormous. Renewed links would politically destabilise us. It would be different if we were still a disintegrating society with no revenue of our own.' The islanders may have some reason to remain anxious. Although Argentina's President Menem today speaks eloquently about his commitment to the new international order, the same Menem was elected President after labelling the British the 'pirates of the world'. He said then: 'No matter how much time passes, or how much blood we have to shed, that territory will be ours again.' If he changed his mind once, might he not change it again? Rumours that a lunatic fringe of military officers might have helped this week's bomb attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, are of just the kind to rekindle the islanders' general unease. Yet hostility is softening. Some island officials agree at least to attend talks between Britain and Argentina on issues such as fishing and oil exploration. Meanwhile, Argentine school children are still being taught that the Malvinas belong to them; but they are learning about democracy too. So the question returns: was it worth the fight? Living in Buenos Aires through the war I never doubted that it was, if only because Britain's response promised the destruction of a vicious military regime. On my return to Buenos Aires ten years later, I found a country deepening its determination to put history behind it. This change, and the restoration of commercial and diplomatic links, make a far more fitting tribute to those, from both sides, who died in 1982, than the islanders' present intransigence.

Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential is good all around the islands. But we will not know exactly how much oil is there until someone starts digging.' The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the North Sea, the survey said. But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary, since full seismic data would only become available next year. It further emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence of oil. A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned. Only after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed. Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina.

Turning to his passenger, who was also his commanding officer, he commented on the 'village' they had just passed and, as they motored on into the countryside, wondered when they would see Stanley. Indeed, at a glance, it is difficult to understand what all the fuss was about. The islands - that saw an Argentine invasion and subsequent death of more than 1,000 soldiers ten years ago - still look not much different from a scattering of Scottish isles. Stark and windswept, they loom out of the south Atlantic like a geological afterthought. Stanley, where most of the Falklands population of 2,100 is concentrated, has fewer facilities than many smallish European villages: primitively built houses, a single bank and the Upland Goose, which represents the capital's claim to an international hotel but in reality is little more than a glamorised pub. It keeps its clients entertained with nightly videos and a one-page summary of world news. Newspapers arrive several days late. It says much for the abandoned condition of the British colony before the war that the present-day Falklands boasts of economic progress: a new fully equipped hospital and school, a new telephone and road system linking some previously isolated areas, and a new military airport that can be used by wide-bodied jets. No British government, having lost lives to retain the islands, could afford to let them sink into oblivion. Between 1982 and 1987, the kelpers, as the islanders call themselves, found it easy to get subsidies for their business projects: Pounds 30m was channelled from London into the civilian sector and Pounds 3bn was earmarked in defence spending. The programme proved controversial because of some ill-judged investments in projects which in different political circumstances might have been subjected to more careful scrutiny. The Falklands programme has since been streamlined and subjected to more control. As the governor of the islands, Mr William Fullerton, says, the economy has entered a 'consolidation phase.' The real change in the Falklands' economic fortunes has come about thanks to the discovery of squid in the South Atlantic and the granting of fishing licences by the local government to foreign companies. The licences now account for 65 per cent of the islands' operating revenue, even though this is still only a third of what the British Ministry of Defence pays out to maintain its troops on the islands. Thanks to squid, the islands are more self-sufficient than they used to be and less dependent on their traditional wool industry, which over the years suffered because of weak world demand. The new sense of confidence is personified by Mr Terry Betts. In 1982 he was an employee of the Falkland Islands Company, which virtually controlled the local economy but whose substantial landholdings have been broken up and distributed with government assistance to Falklands residents. Its Stanley holdings, including the Upland Goose, are up for sale. Today, Mr Betts and his wife run their own businesses, including several smaller retailing outlets, and have taken shareholdings in some of the foreign companies which have obtained licences. 'We've moved from living within a colonial glove,' he said, 'to having a sense of our own identity. What matters to me is success and economic growth.' The problem for the Falklands is where to go next. Officials believe the islands' licensing regime has reached its maximum potential, balancing the need to increase revenue and the need to conserve stocks on which future revenue depends. In fact, licensing revenue has fallen to Pounds 25m from its peak of Pounds 28m in the 1988-89 season because of more stringent conservation and competition from other fishing areas. One option being considered by the government is broadening the scope of the islands' economic involvement in the fishing industry through development of onshore facilities and a more carefully scrutinised programme of joint ventures. Few kelpers have any direct stake in what is actually fished in their waters, while support facilities are based in the Chilean port of Punta Arenas. There is also growing local interest in the prospect of developing oil resources. London has authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences. At the same time it has embarked on talks with Argentina - at which island officials have been present - with a view eventually to discussing issues such as harmonisation of legislation, enviromental policies and demarcation of zones. No conclusive survey has ever been done in and around the islands, although the offshore seabed has long been rumoured to hold large oil reserves. However, any serious oil development in the islands could well provoke considerable environmental and political problems and thereby revive the issue of sovereignty.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT921-2097", "score": 17.309099197387695}, {"content": "Title: Content: 920402 FT 02 APR 92 / Falklands invites oil search tenders THE FALKLAND ISLANDS gov-ernment is inviting tenders for seismic studies in disputed territorial waters in the South Atlantic, in effect excluding Argentina from the initial search for oil in the area. Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area - such as full-scale exploration - must await agreement between London and Buenos Aires. However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on every stage of the Falklands' oil programme. Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty. Surprised foreign ministry officials in Buenos Aires said they had been reassured by the UK there would be no unilateral move on oil. Argentina wants to participate in the seismic studies, which it considers important in establishing the true economic potential of the area. Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters. But the Foreign Office in London said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the islands. There is widespread speculation in the Falklands and in Buenos Aires that the islands have large oil reserves. A study of their oil potential by a private company in the 1970s has remained a closely guarded secret. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the islands' council, said there was no reason why the Falkland Islands could not go ahead with the studies. He expected seismic studies to be completed by the end of this year and to be in a position to licence blocks for exploration by the middle of 1993. Mr Sampson said local councillors had been 'made aware by the British government' that in the 'longer term there will have to be a much closer co-operation with Argentina in the exploration of oil'. UK-Argentine talks in Buenos Aires in February about oil were inconclusive, but further negotiations are planned for in London in June.

Despite defeat in the 1982 conflict, Argentina never surrendered its claim to the islands. Today, it is continuing the struggle by economic warfare, rather than by force of arms. Just before Christmas, after fishing talks with Britain, Argentina said it would start selling fishing licences of its own, breaking the islands' lucrative fishing monopoly. The Falklands began issuing licences in 1987, mainly to squid-fishing ships from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. After knowing only hardship and austerity, the islanders were soon taking in more than Pounds 20m a year in licence fees, making them some of the wealthiest people on earth. The illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the South Atlantic's most lucrative species. Already, Argentina has attracted most of the Falklands' best customers by offering 45 cut-price, three-year licences, valid for an extended fishing season. Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, says that 'the impact is pretty dramatic'. Last year, he sold between 140 and 150 licences, half of them to Japanese vessels. Argentina has however sold all its licences to Japanese ships that used to fish in Falklands waters. The islanders always knew that Argentina would eventually break their monopoly. The only surprise was the time it took. For years after the war, Argentina would not even negotiate with Britain. As it was, nationalistic laws banned foreigners from fishing in its waters, even though the small local industry showed little interest in the South Atlantic. All this changed with the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990. Argentina recognised the Falklands' fishery conservation zones and the two sides started swapping data and controlling illegal fishing. Last October, Argentina changed its laws to allow foreign ships into its waters, as required under a USDollars 1bn five-year fishing agreement with the European Community. From there, it was only a short step to selling squid licences, which had the attraction of depriving the islands of revenue while increasing Argentina's. Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's Foreign Minister, says: 'The bonanza is over. The islanders can look back to the past wistfully, but the future will be different'. He says Argentina will press its rights to the full in future negotiations about a medium and long term fishery arrangement. If the talks become deadlocked, he will appeal to international arbitration, which he says will favour Argentina. Mr Barton fears Argentina could allow over-fishing in its waters to cut the islands' income instead of co-operating to conserve the illex. 'I am not terribly optimistic,' he says. 'If everyone was working on a conservation basis, it would be relatively straightforward to ensure long-term sustainability.' He says that Argentina's political stance makes 'it very difficult to see eye to eye on very simple things'. Mr Hurd underlined the Falklanders fears this week and warned Argentina against using the illex as a 'political toy'. British officials doubt, moreover, that Argentina can police its waters or monitor fish stocks adequately. The illex has a one-year life cycle, so overfishing could wipe it out forever. Mr Barton says the Falklands have an outstanding record on conservation. He has restricted licence sales to prevent overfishing - and to avoid glutting the squid market, which would eventually lower the Falklands' licence revenues. He even hints that a 'squid war' could be in the offing. 'We will have to look at how to make things more attractive for ships to fish in the Falklands,' he says. 'But we see no long term winners. If we take the moral high ground, Argentina could devastate the resource and we would not even see any revenue.' Argentine diplomats dismiss the Falklands' conservation policies. One official accused them of 'depredation' and presenting 'data that is just not serious'. He said Argentina was only taking its fair share of a common resource. The claims and counter-claims are part of the cut and thrust of negotiations and the Argentines are bound to use the squid dispute to press for compromises on issues such as oil exploration. Argentina's ultimate objective is to negotiate the islands' sovereignty - which London refuses even to discuss. Argentina says it wants to 'recover' the Falklands by winning over the islanders' hearts and minds. Distrust of the Argentines runs deep, and Argentina's squid strategy will do nothing to persuade the islanders of its good intentions.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT931-16104", "score": 16.408199310302734}, {"content": "Title: Content: 920227 FT 27 FEB 92 / UK and Argentina open talks on Falklands' oil BRITAIN and Argentina yesterday began discussions in Buenos Aires on developing oil resources in the South Atlantic, writes John Barham from Buenos Aires.

It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil reserves. However, there has been no exploration in the region since an inconclusive survey in the 1970s. Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to the fore. If oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, co-operation with Argentina would be essential to develop the reserves. Major gasfields have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found. Although both sides will use this week's talks to set out their points of view, issues such as harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement, taxation, environmental policies and the demarcation of zones are yet to be addressed.

Last week the UK government announced that it would extend the 12-mile limit around the two island groups to 200 miles to halt over-fishing. British officials said yesterday that new fishing regulations were being drafted similar to those already being enforced around the Falklands. Argentina reacted angrily to Britain's decision to extend territorial waters and will be doubly displeased by a unilateral move to charge vessels for the right to fish there. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Georgias and South Sandwich islands as well as the Falklands. In statements issued over the weekend, Argentine officials said the new 200-mile limits would indirectly grant Argentina a role in fishing policy because both island groups fell within the ambit of the 22-nation Commission on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, of which both Argentina and Britain were members. British officials dismissed that suggestion, however, insisting that they would not accept any Argentine role that implied recognition of its territorial claims. For the moment, the British announcement is only a formality as London lacks fishery patrol ships to enforce the extended limits.

The colony's 2,200 inhabitants, almost all of British descent, barely outnumber the 2,000 UK airmen, soldiers and sailors posted there. Since the 1982 UK-Argentine conflict over the islands, an influx of new blood has reversed the population decline. But numbers have never been much greater than today and as a surge of prosperity based on squid fishery peters out, nothing short of an oil bonanza is likely to change that. The two communities live apart. Most servicemen are housed at Mount Pleasant, a new airfield complex built on a peat bog 35 miles from Stanley, the capital, along a road that (although the islands' best) is only partly tarmac. They are pretty self-sufficient. A sore point, under discussion with local authorities, is that mess kitchens use New Zealand lamb, in a territory whose treeless, wind-battered expanses serve little productive purpose except as grazing for 750,000 sheep. The meat comes by way of Britain, 8,400 miles away, in what is probably the longest voyage ever undertaken by a meat carcase. The thing is that the islands have no EC-standard abattoir and they say they cannot now afford one. Nevertheless, the armed forces are the islands' biggest cash customer, and the biggest tourism earner. They are warmly appreciated. Military flights, which anywhere else might be considered a nuisance, provide reassurance. 'We get complaints when people don't low-fly enough,' says Rear Admiral Neil Rankin, British forces commander. Islanders worry about the improving relations between London and Buenos Aires. The need to co-operate with Argentina, whether on fisheries or on future oil development, is a bitter pill to swallow. The scars from 1982 show no sign of healing. Argentine citizens are still banned. There are no transport connections. The main link to the outside world is the 18-hour, twice-weekly flight to the UK by RAF Tristar. The garrison, with a few Tornado fighters, heavy Hercules aircraft, helicopters and a frigate, is designed to hold the base until reinforcements arrive in a crisis. Running expenses are put at Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year, not counting the pay servicemen would get anyway, nor the cost of the RAF staging post on Ascension Island. In spite of the 'firm and unwavering commitment' pledged during a visit this week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, the number of military personnel may be reduced. But the islanders' numbers could dwindle, too. Sixth-formers go to the UK; there may be less reason for them to come back. Prospects opened up after the war. Under a programme to bring land into local ownership, farm employee Mr Robin Marsh bought 20,000 acres in West Falkland, the smaller of the two main islands, with 5,000 sheep. But for the past three years, as world wool prices have plummeted, he has depended on support from the Falkland Islands government. This support may now stop. The government tapped unprecedented wealth from a licence regime set up in 1987 for vessels fishing within a 150-mile zone. The boats are mostly squid 'jiggers' from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and southern Europe. Government revenue, previously about Pounds 6m a year from wool tax receipts and UK grand aid, shot up to an unaided Pounds 40m. But last year Argentina launched a rival licence scheme, a move widely seen in the islands as deliberate economic pressure. Argentina is in a powerful position, since the young squid move south to the Falklands through its waters. It agreed with Britain last December to limit this season's number of licences. But the Falklands have slashed their estimate of licence earnings for the financial year just ending from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15m. Next year, government officials say, the planning figure is just Pounds 10m. At the islands' secretariat on Thatcher Drive, Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive, describes it as 'perhaps the greatest reduction in revenue that any country will experience short of having a war.' Public works, including the upgrading of tracks into something resembling proper roads, have run out of money. The good times have nonetheless left their imprint. A new hospital and school have been built. With a gradual migration from 'camp' - the country areas - residents say Stanley has become more bustling and urban. Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles can be spotted among the Land Rovers. Outlying settlements now have telephones and next month should receive television programmes. But where else do the armed forces provide the only television service? Sparseness, Englishness and remoteness make for an odd society. Darts matches and sheepdog trials are covered live on radio. The islands have no cash machine, no Indian restaurant, no illegal drugs and as yet no dole. There are as many species of penguin as pubs. What the islanders are waiting for is offshore oil. Successful exploration has been carried out in nearby Argentine waters. A seismic survey to the south is almost complete. Another has started to the north. Mr Sampson says even getting as far as exploration would bring a dramatic boost in population. Oil could transform the islands. But people are in two minds about the prospect. They value their unspoilt lifestyle.

According to British estimates, there are about 30,000 mines but local sources estimate the number is much smaller. Early last week President Carlos Menem authorized Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella to make the offer, which was received by British Foreign Office representative Peter Hall on 30 December. The explosion of some of the mines and the damages they have caused concern the islanders, who have fenced off large areas near Puerto Argentino where animals and people are banned from entering. The Argentine forces thought the British were going to land in that region. During the last days of 1993 the British media reported the concern over this issue by British public and private organizations. According to inquiries made in official circles, there are no plans of the mined territory. However, even if the exact locations of the mines were known, one must bear in mind the possibility that they may have moved -- due to the type of terrain -- a considerable distance from the barred area. In view of this it is believed that the task of clearing the mines will take quite some time. According to information leaked on the meeting Di Tella held with the British ambassador, the latter thanked him for the offer but warned that he could not give an answer until an answer was received from the government of the Falklands, which probably would be informed about the offer in \"the first days of 1994.\" According to what Di Tella told LA NACION, the task of finding the mines would not be carried out by local experts even though there are highly qualified people in the country to do this job. The purpose is to prevent the islanders from reaching any conclusions that do not match the government's real intentions. Since a year ago a group of Argentine engineers has been clearing mine fields in Kuwait sown with sophisticated bombs by the Iraqi forces during the Gulf War. If the proposal is accepted, the work will be done by experts from third countries whose salaries will, obviously, be paid by Argentina.

The results were obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government, YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million for the seismic maps. Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing the Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the area. Argentina reacted by sending \"letters of discomfort\" [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them that any activities carried out in the waters around the Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal conflict in the future. Without taking the threat into account, the island's government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the study results up for sale late last year. This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the island's government that the first oil company interested in buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey. This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of investigation into operation. Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a telephone not listed in the Houston directory. Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps, according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government. The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey result's sale. There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: \"It is the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if there is something wrong with your stomach.\" This is why the news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants. Adviser Wendy Teggart said: \"It is a rumor but it seems that YPF bought the seismic studies.\" But she immediately said it was true by adding: \"It is better for us because if YPF decides to buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters.\" When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the process on those terms because no oil company would risk millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed sovereignty. The island's government members who were asked by this daily said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that the first company that bought the seismic studies was Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or early April in Buenos Aires. The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since the British went ahead with the seismic survey without consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less costly step of the process. The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain through probes was \"optimistic.\" The survey said there may be oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain. Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20 or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation. The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style of their small community. To answer this type of question, the islands government has recently contracted the services of the company Environment Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known oil tax expert. The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina is not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FBIS3-33035", "score": 13.895099639892578}, {"content": "Title: Content: 920130 FT 30 JAN 92 / Book Review: Military leader, not a moralist ONE HUNDRED DAYS: The Memoirs of the Falklands Battle Group Commander By Admiral Sandy Woodward (with Patrick Robinson) HarperCollins (Pounds 18) It was George Orwell who remarked that in England 'all the boasting and flag-waving, the 'Rule Britannia' stuff, is done by small minorities'. Writing more than 50 years ago, he noted that popular war writing always concerns tales of disaster and retreat. British military heroes have a tendency to remove themselves from the limelight after the main event, which makes this book an unusual contribution to the large Falklands library, as the 10th anniversary of the war fast approaches. At a superficial level Admiral Sandy Woodward, commander of the British task force, gives the lie to the view that the Falklands experience was simply an accident of history with no wider application. It is a celebration of a military victory won against enormous odds, asserting, to quote Mrs Thatcher who wrote the preface, 'the massive sense of justice ever-present in the minds of the (British) men who fought in the South Atlantic'. Not for the first time we are reminded, in some detail, of the extraordinary logistics of the South Atlantic war. The book also notes the military co-operation between the UK and the US, which was to be echoed eight years later in the Gulf war and which saved men like Woodward from the consequences of UK defence cuts. Its pages record the courage, military skills and professionalism of some of the men involved, while not attempting to ignore the extent to which events often turned on luck. The opening chapter, ghost-written by author Patrick Robinson, describes the loss of HMS Sheffield - sunk by a French-made Exocet - in the staccato rhythm of the comic strip war hero. The style, however, settles down and there is enough material - including extracts from his own personal diary - to justify Admiral Woodward's reputation as the most controversial senior commander on the spot. Take his first reaction to the Falklands, for example: 'Twenty degrees warmer and it would be the yachting centre in the world. As it is, bloody awful, . . . definitely not a jewel in the Queen's crown.' Woodward was an admiral in the Thatcherite mode: non-traditional, vaguely classless and often ruthless. During the war, he told journalists on the command ship, HMS Hermes: 'South Georgia was the appetiser, now this is the heavy punch coming up behind . . . This is the run-up to the Big Match which in my view should be a walkover.' Most of the criticism that followed came from those who considered him too confident. The Royal Navy lost nearly half of the ships it had started with and played little part in the final military defeat of the Argentine army. It is the British army commanders, not Woodward, who deserve credit for the recapture of the islands. Being remembered as a nice man or a moralist does not rank high in Woodward's list of priorities. Nor does he want to be remembered as a politician or a diplomat. He does want to be seen as having helped lead Britain into war in the only way that had a chance of military victory. The loss of HMS Sheffield is blamed on a mixture of bad luck and a succession of military lapses by officers under Woodward's command. But the most controversial of the naval episodes, the sinking of the Belgrano, was in Woodward's view a necessary means to an end. He confirms that the enemy's cruiser was moving away from the task force when it was hit, but insists that its speed and direction were irrelevant. 'What counts is his position, his capability, and what I believe to be his intention.' The Belgrano had been involved earlier in a pincer movement and, as far as Woodward was concerned, it could have become so again. The book reveals how the conduct of the campaign was dictated by this kind of military logic. It was the navy that convinced Mrs Thatcher to send the task force, and the navy that convinced her to change her rules of engagement to make the sinking of the Belgrano possible. Once the islands had been reached, the war entered an irreversible military momentum. To that extent, it is a chilling reminder of the subservience of politics in times of war, and the ease with which a minor incident can develop into a bloody conflict. And yet Woodward was no Admiral Anaya or General Galtieri, the repressive junta chiefs for whom the invasion was a political necessity. Returning to his office after the war, Woodward opened one of his first official letters. It was the navy's Pay and Pensions Department, advising him that his entertainment allowance was being trimmed. Woodward comments: 'That letter brought me down to earth with a considerable thump. This country really does have its own wonderful way of ensuring that no one gets too big for his boots.' It is a pity that Mrs Thatcher didn't write that into her preface too.

Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said: 'Britain will pay a very high price for this joke.' He said Argentina would censure the British decision in multilateral conservation bodies covering the Antarctic. However, the ministry did not expand on what price Argentina planned to exact from the UK or how it would do so. Britain had told Argentina privately that it intended to introduce a fishing regime in the two islands' territorial waters on August 1, but made no statement on the issue.

London had already extended to 200 miles, from 12 miles, the islands' territorial waters prior to imposing the licence regime, similar to one introduced in the nearby Falkland Islands seven years ago. UK officials said they have already received considerable signs of interest from fishing companies to take out the new licences, with fees to be based on a percentage of the catch. Debate in Argentina over the future of the Falkland Islands has intensified in the past 10 days, after it had emerged that the Argentine government was considering the concession, under its sovereignty, of a special status for the islands, similar to Puerto Rico's status as an associate of the US. This would enable the islands to retain all their present rights of self-determination, the use of sterling as currency, and allegiance to the British crown, while transferring only formal sovereignty to Argentina.

Senior officials in Argentina said last night it would protest at the move, once formal notification had arrived from London. Argentina has long claimed the two more distant archipelagoes, as well as the Falklands themselves. It was Britain's expulsion of a team of Argentine workers from a whaling station on South Georgia that triggered the Argentine invasion in 1982, leading to the Falklands war. Warned of the British move, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign minister, had said earlier: 'Argentina does not agree and nor does it seem constructive to us.' Announcing the move in London, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, said that there was a need to reinforce conservation arrangements in the area. Chile, Russia and Japan are among the nations fishing in these waters. The anxieties about fish conservation had been discussed with the Argentine government, 'with whom we have extensive exchanges on South Atlantic matters', and ministers looked forward to pursuing this dialogue, he said. The Foreign Office said that the UK government did not believe the extension of jurisdiction to be provocative. Argentina had been consulted because of its claim (disputed by the UK) to sovereignty over the islands, not because Argentine boats were seen as mainly responsible for over-fishing.

The Argentinians declared they would not 'tolerate, accept and much less consent' to the move. The UK claimed poachers used this so-called 'Gap' area as a bolt-hole. Even though the Gap lies within Falklands territorial waters, British officials say they tried to discuss the issue with Buenos Aires all year. The Argentinians kept postponing talks and the British decided to act unilaterally. President Carlos Menem angrily said he would send patrol ships into the Gap, even though it lies outside Argentina's 200-mile territorial limit. Although he played down the issue later in the week, the Falklands remain a contentious and sensitive issue. British diplomats posted in Buenos Aires must master the intricacies of fishing data and develop a thorough understanding of the mating and migratory habits of Illex squid, the islands' main resource. The Illex travels through Argentine and Falkland waters, so both sides now hold talks to share the catch. They have learned to co-operate over protecting squid, to preserve what has become a very big industry. They swap catch data, establish quotas and keep each other posted about the position of poachers. Although Falklanders sneer at Argentina's inability to patrol its waters effectively, the coast guard is notoriously aggressive. Trigger-happy captains often pepper poachers with gunshot. Last May, a Taiwanese ship sank after fleeing into Falkland waters when a coast guard cutter fired on it. Licence sales are a vital revenue source for the Falklands. This year's fish licence sales of Pounds 24.1m make up nearly two-thirds of government revenues. However, this is a far cry from the boom years of the 1980s. In 1989, the islands raked in a record Pounds 28.8m from fisheries. Next year, the islands do not expect to sell more than Pounds 16.6m worth of licences. The main reason for this is competition from Argentina which recently launched a rival licence regime of its own, selling 60 licences this year, priced to undercut the Falkland licences. Furthermore, this year's Illex season was exceptionally bad. Ships caught only 67,000 tonnes in Falklands waters against an historical average of 165,000 tonnes. Both Argentina and the islands closed the Illex season early to preserve the stocks. In addition, a fisheries agreement between Argentina and the European Union has led to a big increase in catches. The pact allows European vessels to enter Argentine waters once closed to foreign ships in exchange for grants and privileged access to EU markets. Brussels wants to find new fishing grounds outside European waters, mainly to benefit Spain's big fishing fleet. In 1993, 915,500 tonnes of fish were caught in Argentine waters, 126 per cent more than five years earlier. Although these statistics are not reliable, they do indicate a rising trend in fishing effort. Argentina now exports more fish than beef. Fish export revenues last year rose 18 per cent to Dollars 660m. Hake accounted for nearly half Argentina's 1993 catch of 422,000 tonnes, an increase of 14 per cent over 1992. Squid volumes rose 150 per cent to 194,000 tonnes. But Mr Julio Torre, the editor of Redes, a fishing trade publication, warns: 'Catches are reaching their limits for several species, especially hake. Blue whiting and squid are also approaching their limits. For the first time, this region is reaching its limit.' Although fishing has become a big earner for Argentina, its under-funded and overstretched navy, air force and coast guard are unable to prevent poaching.

Eleven years after its defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands. In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands. He claims his policy of rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000. Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982.' His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain. Eventually, London will have sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty. Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina. But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in bilateral relations. Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the natural resources. In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve fisheries. Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in on the main source of revenue. Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. London has remained unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000 inhabitants agree to a change in their status. Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which Argentina also claims. Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a joint oil regime. London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around the islands. Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities. There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine attitudes. Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain fresh. And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina. London has also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina.

This information has been confirmed. According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of approximately 2,500 meters. The exploration activity is being carried out under the terms of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm, which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains risk contracts with several foreign firms. The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to evaluate the magnitude of the deposit. According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10 and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore, it will be less difficult to refine. Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11 of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in February 1993. Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters. Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon quota of crude oil. In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the country at international market prices if they so decide. Also, no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to sell the product overseas. According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and technical means for oil exploration in an established area and agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered. According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry, seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus operates. Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological terms have been found in this area. These structures are considered very favorable for petroleum deposits. Information available in the foreign companies' zone of operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at present), but also light crude. Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons. Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons. This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FBIS4-33167", "score": 13.28320026397705}, {"content": "Title: Content: 920403 FT 03 APR 92 / Argentines reflect on invasion ARGENTINA yesterday commemorated the 10th anniversary of its invasion of the Falkland Islands with a series of public events which, although low-key, carried political tension.

The one-year arrangement favours Argentina, which will increase its share of a substantially extended fishing effort next year - raising its catch of the prized illex squid by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes. The Falklands will retain its present quota of 150,000 tonnes. The agreement is to be signed in London early next month during an official visit by Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, in which Argentina's claims to the islands will inevitably feature prominently on the agenda. The accord will increase pressure on the islands' financial revenues, which depend heavily on the sale of fishing licences. The islands' government forecasts a 35 per cent fall in licence revenue next year to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 15.5m. Argentine negotiators say, however, that 'the islands could not delude themselves that we would never develop our fishing industry. This agreement allows them to plan ahead'. Argentina is likely to continue increasing its share of the catch in future years. Britain had hoped to strike a long-term agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues.

I sat alone by a window in the ship's lounge and, over the top of a book by the explorer Ernest Shackleton, I stared at the ice of Antarctica. It was the most peaceful Christmas Eve I'd ever known; quiet, cozy, uncomplicated. No rushing. No shopping. No open houses. And too cold to go outside and play. Across the lounge, three white-haired fellows were swapping travel tales. The odd exotic word drifted my way: Borneo, Sherpa, Xian. I saw that they were listening to each other. There is time for such luxury at sea. A Christmas Eve without parades -- just a line of crystal fog that drew an opaque curtain around our ship, there near the bottom of the world. I pushed my book aside and wrapped up in a blanket. In the library, an Australian rancher was busy with water colors. The ship's doctor studied an atlas. A woman from the island of Sark scratched happily at post cards, which would not be mailed until we reached Chile in two weeks. (\"Of course, you may post them at the Polish scientific station on the day after Christmas,\" our leader had said. \"But they might not leave Antarctica until a supply ship comes in six months.\") Simple acts, if any at all, seemed called for. In my cabin, I cleared a space beneath the porthole and arranged five blue limpet shells that I had collected in the Falkland Islands. They were keyhole limpets, and I had found a beach littered with them, in lavender, rose and blue. The fog moved closer. We were the center of a small ring of ocean. We were the keyhole in the limpet. We were the most people for thousands of miles, the 80 of us on that ship. The fog was blinding bright, and when I turned away from the porthole, white circles followed, full moons that bounced on the walls and into the mirror, like the blue dots that burn in your eyes after a flashbulb pops. But enough of drifting dreams. I remembered that I had one Christmas errand. I needed a snip of tape so that I could attach a sprig of Russell lupine to a sack from the Falkland Islands Company store. The lupine was from the garden of a child named Poppy, whom I met on tiny West Point Island. She had handed me a nosegay as I left to sail farther south. Packages were adorned with blue petals and green stalks. It seemed wondrous in this world of icebergs and glaciers. As I left for dinner, I saw that a California couple had come prepared. Printed cards on each door said: \"From our cabin to yours, Merry Christmas.\" A fir tree had been decorated in the lounge, and flickered with green and red lights. I wondered if it had traveled with us from Uruguay, where we began this journey; I had not seen many trees since. We had breakfast in our cabin on Christmas Day: coffee and hot chocolate, bran muffins and orange marmalade, a ripe banana and pears. We traded gifts. I gave him a glacial blue marker pen and two linen towels showing Falklands maps and penguins. I also gave him a fisherman's sweater, knitted by the wives of Port Stanley. He gave me snow-white long underwear, trimmed at the neckline with lace. Far too fancy for the Falklands general store, I thought, and then saw the Nordstrom label. Christmas lunch was a feast of Smithfield ham and roast turkey, baked yams and pumpkin pie, homemade ice cream and baklava. It was borne by a Greek named Babis, who had brought our breakfast tray. After the last hearty toast, we put on red parkas and walked out on the sun-splashed deck. It was warmer now, and snow was beginning to fall. Fat flakes stuck to our hair and wool gloves.

Philippine officials in May gave the green light to Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and US partner Vaalco Energy Inc. of Houston, to begin preliminary exploration work on the Reed Bank, an undersea structure near the South China Sea chain. The six-month, non-exclusive contract includes \"research and library work\" on aeromagnetic surveys and other data held by the Department of Energy. Philippine energy officials insist the area where the exploration would be conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a chain of atolls in the South China Sea claimed wholly by China and in part by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. All claimants but Brunei have stationed troops on islets in the chain. Analysts say Manila's recent move would strengthen its sovereignty over islets, reefs and atolls it has garrisoned, but could also have a political and diplomatic impact on efforts to peacefully resolve the territorial dispute and suggestions for joint development of the area. \"It's a response to what the Chinese and Malaysians are doing,\" Julius Cesar Parrenas, director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told AFP. He was referring to Beijing's granting of a contract to the US-based Crestone Energy Corp. to explore for oil in the area, prompting vehement protests from Vietnam. Malaysia has also embarked on a project to develop a resort in the Spratlys. \"One means of strengthening sovereignty is by already having activity there, such as a contract of government or development plans,\" he said, adding that exploration was a good move by the Philippines. Noel Morada, an analyst with the Institute for Strategic and Development Studies, said what is crucial to the Philippines' move is the reaction of China and Vietnam. \"Since we are taking this particular action, we should be prepared of the possible consequences,\" he said. \"This is an economic move which has political implications.\" Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro and Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang on Tuesday sought to forestall trouble by insisting the permit granted to Alcorn was limited to the Reed Bank and did not include areas in the Spratlys. The Reed Bank is an underwater structure between the Philippine island of Palawan and most of the Spratlys. Lazaro and Bomasang said Manila had done exploratory drilling there in the 1970s, which had not been disputed by other claimants, adding that political and diplomatic repurcussions had been considered before the permit was granted. Alcorn said in a statement the research permit only covered the Reed Bank and excluded the disputed areas of the Spratlys. But the statement said the area of coverage also includes Patag and Lawak islands -- two of the eight small islands and reefs garrisoned by Philippine marines and collectively referred to by Manila as the Kalayaan (Freedom) group. The group was annexed in a presidential decree by the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The Philippines has become an attractive site for oil exploration with news of recent oil strikes off Palawan, confirming the country's potential.

Mr Fernando Gutierrez, fisheries undersecretary, said yesterday that new regulations would allow up to 40 foreign-owned, special squid fishing vessels, known as jiggers, to operate in Argentine waters and catch up to 100,000 tonnes a year. The decision is an important step towards liberalising Argentina's fishing industry. By law, only locally-registered vessels may fish in its territorial waters. However, the new regulations will allow foreign ships to operate on a 'temporary charter' basis in association with Argentine nationals. Argentina lacks jigger capacity of its own and hopes to increase its share of Illex catches by attracting Asian-owned vessels to its waters. Argentina expects to catch only 60,000 tonnes of squid this year, up from 40,000 tonnes in 1991. In comparison, the Falklands expects to catch about 160,000 tonnes of Illex this year, 8.6 per cent less than in 1991. The Falklands introduced a successful licensing regime after the 1982 conflict with Argentina. Squid licences - sold largely to Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean companies - account for 75 per cent of the Falklands' annual licence revenue of Pounds 24m. Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, warned that Argentina's decision would further depress already low Illex prices, and he added that increased fishing effort by Argentina could damage Illex stocks. The squid are very sensitive to environmental factors and over-fishing. Falling prices and the risk to the resource have led the Falklands to curtail fishing every year since 1989.

[Petrella] I believe that during the past few years, we have witnessed more dramatic changes in the world than actual possibilities that Great Britain will transfer the Malvinas Islands' sovereignty to Argentina. We have the examples of South Africa, the Middle East, the changes taking place in Russia, in the former Yugoslavia. The changes the world is experiencing are so unpredictable and fast that something like that could happen. Argentina does not want to rush things, however. Since 1983 and 1990, when relations with Great Britain were restored and, especially, with President Carlos Menem's administration and the implementation of Domingo Cavallo and Guido Di Tella's foreign policy, what has changed is our concern over the islanders' interests. In the past, this aspect was not taken into account as much as it is now. [Carvallo] In what sense? [Petrella] Democratic Argentina realizes that the islanders have their own identity, that the islands' society is no longer the pastoral nor isolated society it was before 1982. To a certain degree, the war, with all its terrible aspects, brought an economic well-being the islanders did not enjoy before. These facts must be taken into account in a negotiation. In fact, during all our meetings with the British and the islanders, we have fully respected their interests. We believe the islands will gradually grow closer to us through dialogue and the fact that Argentina continues to grow and is predictable from the political viewpoint. In addition, the Southern Cone offers a climate of harmony, cooperation, friendship, and firmness regarding our claim. [Carvallo] But are the islanders aware of that? [Petrella] There are concrete signs that lead us to believe that our policy has prompted a debate on the islands. If you read the PENGUIN NEWS (local daily) as carefully as we do, you will notice that the islanders discuss a relationship with Argentina. Naturally, it is not always fully positive. They argue and say rude things about us, but at least we are again a subject of their discussions on the future of the islands, in which Argentina is always mentioned. [passage omitted] [Carvallo] Can you assure that Argentine will never again resort to the use of force? [Petrella] Definitely. First, because it is not ethical; Second, because it does not generate solutions; and third, because we appreciate and need our relationship with Great Britain and Europe, which is almost the same thing. These are three very pragmatic and clear reasons that are by no means idealistic. When we talk about ethics we are not talking about idealism. We are talking about something very sound and very special: force does not yield solutions. It is a `boomerang' because in the long run it would affect our relationship with Great Britain and Europe. Only recently, Argentina overcame the U.S. and European embargo that followed the war. This problem has still not been solved with Great Britain who still refuses to sell us spare parts and military equipment. This is very complicated because most of Argentina's military equipment, traditionally was British. [passage omitted] [Carvallo] It has been said that the islands have about 50 percent more oil than what Great Britain can extract from the North Sea... [Petrella] The two companies that have prospected for oil, with the purpose of finding someone interested in buying their study, might say that. No one has bought that study although the British say a phantom Argentine enterprise did but I do not know for sure. Argentina does not want to hasten a debate that not only has an ecological aspect but also a very important personal aspect. Everyone knows that it takes a lot of people to exploit a single oil well and this will definitely change the islanders way of life which we consider sacred and something that must be preserved. [passage omitted] [Carvallo] It is quite surprising that Argentina, through you, should say that it is not particularly interested in any oil there might be on the islands... [Petrella] I am not making an official statement. It is a comment to a journalist who works for EL MERCURIO, from Chile, a friendly country... I am telling a friend that Argentina could not care less about the oil on the Malvinas because it has plenty of its own and because the oil price is not going to increase. When Russia floods the world with its oil, a very strict cartel will have to be created to prevent prices from dropping. [Carvallo] Some believed oil could cause new tensions in the South Atlantic. [Petrella] Between 1971 and 1982 we gave oil to the islands. Therefore, oil is not the problem, the problem has to do with the jurisdictional and legal aspects of the UK's unilateral exploration and exploitation in the Malvinas. This territory is in dispute and we cannot remain indifferent to unilateral actions. This is why we are seeking cooperation. [Carvallo] To define sovereignty? [Petrella] That is the question. We must generate a common space. We have already made a clear proposal regarding the oil to a high-ranking official. We proposed creating a joint authority to assign exploitation areas according to a practical criteria. All this must be done under the sovereignty \"umbrella\" that was created to enable these moves without either of the two parties acquiring better accumulated rights. [Carvallo] In the meantime, Argentina is telling oil companies that it will oppose oil exploitation without its approval. [Petrella] Of course. We have told them that any investment will encounter legal problems..., but I cannot say what we are going to do. We are warning the companies that this territory is in dispute, when there are so many other places in the world... We cannot or should not approve the exploration and exploitation of resources in these areas until that dispute has been settled or until the involved parties have agreed to tolerate each other. [passage omitted] [Carvallo] Islands Governor David Tatham said to me: Why so much interest in a joint oil exploitation with Argentina when there is also Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil. What would your ministry say about this? [Petrella] The dispute is with Argentina. Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay, as well as the rest of the countries of the hemisphere, have recognized our rights. The UK could, obviously, contact whichever country it wished if a dispute, recognized by the United Nations, did not exist. [Carvallo] What do you expect from Chile then? [Petrella] Solidarity. That contact with the islands be made considering Argentine interests in any negotiation. That Chile maintain the magnificent commitment undertaken by President Patricio Aylwin to back our rights. We regard this as one of Chile's greatest acts of friendship throughout our common history. One of the main objectives of President Menem's foreign policy, implemented by Foreign Minister Di Tella, has been to maintain the best and most cordial relationship with Chile. And this not only because of cultural reasons but for economic and strategic reasons. [Carvallo] Chile, however, is in the uncomfortable position that whatever it does may affect its optimum relationship with the two countries in dispute. [Petrella] Argentina's stance on the UK has been to say that it must play a constructive role in the Southern Cone. In other words, it can no longer speculate on differences between Argentina and Chile, as in the past when some were more obvious than others, because there was usually mutual distrust. This must no longer exist. Argentine-Chilean integration must progress. This is why any British Government gesture that may affect the Argentine-Chilean relationship is considered discouraging in Argentina. We have told the British this many times and we are certain we have the support of the Chilean Government. [Carvallo] What has Great Britain done lately regarding Chile that may discourage Argentina? [Petrella] There were three episodes. One was the British Government invitation to Chilean legislators to visit the Malvinas. This, in itself is not especially sensitive but the second episode -- proposing that they set up a Chilean consulate on the islands -- is. That would really be complicated. The third -- the donation of an aircraft -- is obviously a symbol of the conflict. Since Argentina overcame the conflict, it caused no more problems but many believe the British should have known the effect this could have caused. Anyway, the Argentine-Chilean friendship is very strong now. [passage omitted] [Carvallo] Argentina and Chile also have their own territorial conflicts. What outcome due you expect from the controversy over Laguna del Desierto? [Petrella] We hope our representatives will be able to convince the arbitrators of our rights. I believe, with all due respect for Chile and the arbitrators, that our attorneys have good grounds and are eloquent enough to explain them. [Carvallo] Chile has grounds, probably even better ones. Therefore, how sure can Chileans be that Argentina will not declare any ruling on Laguna del Desierto not in its favor null? [Petrella] Today's Argentina is not the Argentina of the past. Nor is the current relationship between Chile and Argentina the same as in the past.

The drilling is the first by NAPC, a Canadian-led consortium, since Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1987 over conflicting claims to offshore oil rights in the Aegean.

As the islanders celebrate the event this weekend in the company of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Argentina is still agonising over the defeat. Despite this, for the first time in years, there is a sense of hope and optimism in the air in Buenos Aires. Argentina has changed since it sent its forces to recover the islands and now is enjoying a period of unprecedented political freedom and economic growth. In many ways, yesterday's defeat and today's relative prosperity are closely linked. Defeat not only broke the power of the military and restored civilian rule, it also eroded the power of other groups such as the church, big business and trade unions that had blocked reforms for decades. Hyperinflation in 1989 hastened the end of the corrupt, inefficient state-dominated economy. When he took office in 1989, President Carlos Menem was forced to introduce what has become one of the world's most radical and most successful free market reforms. Today, Argentina has low inflation, rapid economic expansion and growing international prestige. The economy is set to grow 6 per cent this year and inflation should fall to below 20 per cent from 84 per cent in 1991. Growth, stability and respectability, as well as overarching objectives in their own right, are also part of the strategy to win control of the Falklands. Recovering the Falklands remains a national aspiration that no government can ignore. Only last week, Mr Menem repeated earlier statements that Argentina would peacefully establish sovereignty over the islands 'by the year 2000'. Argentine diplomats argue that as their country becomes a respected member of the international community by creating a stable, prosperous and democratic system open to international trade and investment, the Falklands' rejection of ties with Argentina - culminating in full integration - will therefore appear increasingly unreasonable. The architect of Mr Menem's foreign and economic policies is Mr Domingo Cavallo. He became foreign minister in 1989, when he established Argentina's pro-western foreign policy. In 1991 he became economy minister, creating a convertible currency and bringing much-needed energy and coherence to Mr Menem's flagging reforms. Argentina not only restored diplomatic relations with London in 1990. It has submitted to American pressure to scrap the controversial Condor II ballistic missile project and abandoned exports of sensitive missile and nuclear technologies. It has applied for membership of the 24-member industrial-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and rarely misses an opportunity to join in United Nations peace-keeping missions. In return, it has won crucial backing from the US and other G7 countries in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Talks with London over the Falklands have moved on from sterile bickering over sovereignty to mundane, but more productive discussions over fishing rights and oil exploration regimes. Meanwhile, both sides have simply agreed to disagree over the underlying issue of sovereignty. Mr Guido di Tella, the foreign minister, has even gone so far as accepting the importance of recognising the islanders' rights, rather than their interests - an important distinction which demonstrates an Argentine willingness to compromise. Another important strand in the intertwining economic and foreign policies is Argentina's courtship of British trade and investment. Britain's exports are set to double this year from about Pounds 70m in 1991, while Argentine exports should remain stable at about Pounds 140m. Bilateral trade is still to reach the level at which it stood in 1981: Pounds 298.1m. Officials want to attract UK investment in Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme. Furthermore, privatised utility companies are expected to invest heavily in upgrading the collapsing infrastructure, making Argentina a promising market for everything from railway equipment to power generators. Buenos Aires believes growing British exports and investments will help reduce the Falklanders' suspicions of all things Argentine. They also hope UK companies with business in Argentina could counteract the highly effective anti-Argentine Falklands lobby in Whitehall and Westminster. However, the potential for expanding trade is limited by the lack of British government export insurance cover. British officials say coverage will only be resumed once Argentina establishes a track record in honouring international financial commitments. That will be easier than persuading London to change its policy of defending the Falklanders' right to self determination. And the islanders remain as resolutely anti-Argentine as ever. Furthermore, Argentina still faces problems that will inevitably encourage suspicion of its opponents in the British parliament. The economy may be booming on the back of consumer demand, but Argentina's industry is still a long way from being internationally competitive. In spite of 10 years of democracy, congress is weak and, like the judiciary, dominated by an all-powerful presidency. Mr Menem himself is permanently dogged by corruption scandals. He cares little for institutional reform, except for pushing hard for a constitutional amendment which would allow him to stand for re-election. An economic reverse, such as an upsurge in inflation, could have dangerous political side effects. Equally, a political upset, such as another scandal or complications arising from Mr Menem's campaign to amend the constitution, could destabilise the economy. The Argentine belief that its commendable policies will bring it any closer to winning the Falkland Islands in the foreseeable future may thus prove to be a delusion.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT922-3165", "score": 12.141400337219238}, {"content": "Title: Content: 941001 FT 01 OCT 94 / Fishing: Trout that grew and grew When Darwin landed on the Falkland Islands in 1834 he was unimpressed. Wild cattle roamed a trackless waste otherwise devoid of mammal life. But Darwin was not a fly fisherman. Even if he had been, the meandering estuaries and thin, curling rivers would have stirred no tremors in his casting arm, for the only freshwater fish in the Falklands were two small species of no account. The estuaries were dominated by bulbous-headed, slim-tailed grey mullet which slipped in and out on the tide, not a sportsman's target. Darwin's genius lay in looking back in time, not forward. Even the pioneers of the 1940s, who changed the Falklands fishery, had no idea what their actions would produce. Brown trout eggs were imported from England and Scotland, making the 8,000-mile sea journey in trays of ice. On arrival in sub-Antarctica they were transferred to milk-churns, strapped to horses, and hauled to the interior. There they were put in the sweet waters of the slow-moving, spring-fed rivers. Brown trout are a resilient, adaptive, tough and invasive species. Originally found only in Europe, today's map reflects their colonisation of the rest of the globe. Wherever Europeans went they took fish with them, and there are now naturalised populations as far apart as Japan, New Guinea, Peru and Pakistan. Within 10 years of the brown trout introductions, Falklanders found themselves catching trout which had turned silver and grown immeasurably bigger than their impoverished brethren. The questing brown trout, finding inadequate food in the rivers, which were also prone to dry up and lose essential oxygen, had migrated to estuaries and the sea, where protein-rich krill swarmed. The present record for a Falklands sea trout, winkled on to the bank of the San Carlos river in 1992 by Alison Faulkner, a British angler, is nearly 23lb. Scale analysis showed it to be a remarkable 10 years old and to have spawned at least five times. Sea trout have this advantage over the Atlantic salmon, their rival gamefish: they are better able to recover from the rigours of spawning, they spawn more often and, because the core stock remains in fresh water, they cannot, like salmon, so easily be exploited to the verge of extinction. It is a curious fact of the brown trout's sea-going urge that it principally motivates the female; males stay at home. When the female returns, silver and big and bursting with ova from the tremendous larders in the salt, two or three share a communal nest. The diminutive resident brown male can then fertilise the eggs of several females. Enough biology. The proper concern of all self-respecting Falklands visitors is how to attach this gleaming silver maiden to a fly manipulated by a fishing rod. The answer is, as it should be, with difficulty. The really big fish in any migratory run need special attention. In the Falklands the sea trout run into rivers from January until the end of the fishing season in April. The best fishing month is February. But the big fish tend to run together, towards the end of the season, and waste as little time as possible in freshwater. On the Chartres river, in West Falkland, ghillie Tony Blake said he and Alison Faulkner had seen sea trout so big they could have eaten her record-breaker. Blake is a fishing phenomenon himself. Everything that happens as you fish the pool under his eagle-eye relates to his search for the big fish. A 2lb trout jumped. He said: 'Right. The big fella won't be here. He would have chased that minnow out. Try there.' I did. He was there. Meantime my fishing partner had caught 27 sea trout, averaging 2 1/2 lb, in three hours. Blake particularly likes the story of the American fly-dresser who came to report on which of his 200 flies Falklands sea trout would take. 'How are you getting on?' Blake inquired. 'Badly,' replied the American. 'They take them all.' If the Falklands was situated where the Canaries are, British fishermen would be trampling the grass flat on the banks. As it is, virtually no one goes there. For more information: Go Fishing Canada, Swan Centre, Fishers Lane, London W4 IRX.

Perhaps the least accessible destination on this shrinking globe has been the mysterious realm beneath the sea, but even that is no longer forbidding. Take a deep breath, folks, and hold it; you may be traveling underwater soon. New and unusual opportunities to tour -- or at least view -- the shadowy depths are becoming increasingly available. In the past, underwater sightseeing was limited mostly to scuba divers and snorkelers. They alone had the pleasure of exploring the world's tropical reefs and sea gardens -- the habitat of rare and colorful fish and strange marine creatures. Nowadays, even the less-adventurous traveler can journey beneath the sea fairly easily. There's a fleet of six sightseeing submarines, the Atlantis I through VI, that carry passengers in submerged voyages from resort islands in the Pacific and Caribbean. All have large viewing windows on each side and in the nose. If this whets your appetite, consider spending a night in what may be the world's only underwater lodge. The hotel, with only two guest rooms, is on the floor of a lagoon on the Atlantic shore of Key Largo, Fla. Although anyone can stay there, unless you're a licensed diver you will have to practice diving techniques for two to three hours at the front desk before you'll be allowed to descend to your room. Since underwater sightseeing is an obvious complement to a beach vacation, what follows is a list of half a dozen unusual possibilities. They include a luxury cruise for divers in Indonesia, snorkeling tours in public parklands in Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, a visit to an underwater aquarium in the Caribbean and a trio of research expeditions to the reefs of Fiji, Bonaire and the Red Sea. To view the realm beneath the sea: -- Book passage on a submarine. The Atlantis fleet has been growing rapidly. Vessels give passengers an eye-to-eye view of a multitude of sea creatures. It's the next best thing to diving, and you won't have to worry about a shark attack. Atlantis submarines operate regularly from Grand Cayman Island, Barbados and St. Thomas in the Caribbean; Oahu and Hawaii in the Hawaiian Islands, and Guam in the Pacific. A seventh will begin sailing from Aruba in the southern Caribbean next fall. The subs on Grand Cayman and Barbados -- named Atlantis I and II -- were built to hold 28 passengers each. The others are larger, each seating 46 passengers. All are operated by a three-man crew. The newest subs, which look as if they've been borrowed from a modernistic ride in a Walt Disney theme park, are 65 feet long. Each side sports 13 circular viewing windows, each two feet in diameter. An extra-large window in the bow, a giant porthole, enables passengers to see directly ahead. The vessels are air conditioned, and normal sea-surface atmospheric pressure is maintained. A cruise lasts about an hour. The high-tech subs can submerge to about 150 feet but generally do not go below 100 feet. For safety's sake, the pilot and copilot follow a regular itinerary. Overhead, a surface vessel sails the same path as the sub, alerting other boats to the sub below. Some night cruises are offered. Underwater colors are brighter at night when a spotlight from a sub is shined on them. For information, contact the tourism office of the island you're interested in visiting. -- Spend a night on the ocean floor. There are two rooms with undersea view, meals included. Your host for these unusual accommodations is Jules' Undersea Lodge of Key Largo, just south of Miami. The rooms have become so popular since they were opened three years ago that you may have to reserve months ahead. The structure, shaped somewhat like an oversized trailer, was built as an underwater research station in Puerto Rico, a function it served for several years. In 1986, an investor bought it, moved it to Key Largo and sunk it 30 feet to the bottom of a two-acre, ocean-fed lagoon. The habitat has two private bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a sitting room. It is equipped with telephone and television. Maximum occupancy usually is six guests, but eight can be accommodated. Each of the bedrooms has a large window looking into the lagoon. Generally, you'll see 75 to 80 species of fish during daylight hours, manager Nancy Fabiano says. At night, lights can be flicked on when shrimp, crab and lobsters are active. Dinner and breakfast, part of an overnight package, are prepared ahead. When you are hungry, you pop them into the microwave oven. Most guests are experienced divers, which is handy because you have to dive to get to your room. But lodge personnel will train you sufficiently to make the round trip accompanied by a guide each way. A special breathing hose and mouthpiece is used. Claustrophobic people might want to skip this adventure. For the lodge's Aquanaut Program (check in at 1 p.m., check out at 11 a.m. the following day), the rate is $295 per person a night, including full meals, snacks and unlimited diving. A less expensive version provides for 5:30 p.m. check-in, 9:30 a.m. check-out and light meals for $195 per person. The lodge is operated jointly with Key Largo Undersea Park, which opened last November. The park offers guided snorkeling tours of the lagoon and the exterior of the underwater lodge. Snorkelers are given a device so they can hear what the guide is saying. Unlike the snorkelers, the guide walks the bottom of the lagoon in scuba gear. The one-hour tour is $12 for adults, $10 for children and $35 for a family of four. Equipment is included. Armchair explorers can \"take a tour\" seated inside the park auditorium. A guide moves about the lagoon while a live camera sends the image to the theater screen. A two-way communications system allows the viewers to question the guide and hear the response. Admission is $6 for adults and $4 for children. For information on all three programs, contact Jules' Undersea Lodge, P.O. Box 3330, Key Largo, Fla. 33037, (305) 451-2353. -- Go snorkeling in a public park. At least two large underwater parks, one in Florida and the other in the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer snorkelers good opportunities for guided excursions. The most conveniently sited is Florida's John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park on Key Largo about half a mile from Jules' Undersea Lodge. About 21 1/2 miles long and 6 1/2 miles wide, the park is habitat for hundreds of species of fish. On the ocean floor are the wrecks of many ships. Snorkeling trips and glass-bottom boat cruises are provided by a park concessionaire, Coral Reef Park Co. On half-day snorkeling trips, you are ferried out to the reef about six miles from shore, where you will spend about 2 1/2 hours exploring the sea life. The trips depart daily at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. and are limited to six people. The cost is $30 per person. Equipment is included. An alternative is one of the 90-minute trips. It departs at 9 a.m., noon and 3 p.m., and the limit is 60 participants. Cost is $19 per person. The glass-bottom boat, which carries 100 passengers, departs at 9 a.m., noon and 3 p.m. for a 2 1/2-hour cruise. Cost is $11. For snorkeling and cruise reservations, call toll-free (800) 344-8175. Just offshore from St. Croix in the Virgin Islands is a small, unpopulated island designated Buck Island Reef National Monument. The designation protects the island's 180 acres, plus 700 acres of surrounding Caribbean Sea. Tourists to St. Croix generally reach the island on half a day or one-day tours offered by any of seven concessionaires licensed by the U.S. Park Service. Ticket offices are on the wharf at Christiansted. By power boat the traveling time is 30 to 40 minutes -- by sail, 60 to 90 minutes. Buck Island is blessed with one of the loveliest white-sand beaches in the Caribbean. Beginner snorkelers generally are given a short lesson near the beach, and then the group (no more than six per guide) sails to a mooring on the southeast tip of the island. This is the beginning of the Buck Island Underwater Trail, which winds through a complex and colorful marine garden. Water along the trail is about 15 feet deep. Resting floats are provided if you tire of swimming. A half-day trip concludes with the tour. A full-day tour includes time for swimming, sunbathing and hiking on Buck Island. Rates are about $25 per person for half a day and $50 for a full day, which includes refreshments. St. Croix is still recovering from the impact of Hurricane Hugo, but tourism authorities expect the island to be back on its feet and in shape to welcome visitors by May. Special spring lodging packages are being offered to attract tourists. Visit an underwater aquarium. St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is home to Coral World, a popular attraction for cruise line passengers who want a peek at the sea beneath their ship. Coral World makes that possible with its observation tower, which descends rather then ascends. The circular tower is offshore about 50 feet and can be reached by crossing a long ramp. From the surface, the underwater tower drops three levels. At the bottom people are under 15 feet of water. Wide windows that encircle the tower look out upon the sea life of St. Thomas. Schools of fish swim by and then disappear into the vast expanse of the sea. Strange marine plants float with the gentle motion of the water. Coral World is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. For information, call (809) 775-1555. -- Join a research program. As a paying volunteer on a scientific research program, you can view marine life and perform a part in preserving it. Among the varied projects for 1990 sponsored by Earthwatch are at least three involving the study of reef areas in diverse parts of the world. All projects are led by scientists. In Fiji, teams will watch the recovery of a reef damaged by a 1985 typhoon. Twice daily at low tide, strong reef walkers will collect specimens of coral, shrimp and sponges. Lodging is in modern Fiji cottages, and a Fijian cook prepares dinner. The cost for the two-week program is $1,750. Air fare is additional. Departures are Aug. 1 and Aug. 18. On the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the goal is to study snails, sponges and other creatures that inhabit mini-caves in the reef. The trip is open to certified scuba divers, who will make up to two dives a day collecting specimens. Cost for two weeks is $1,960 per person. Air fare is additional. Departures are May 20, June 5 and June 21. In the Red Sea in Israel, the mating practices of the whitebelly damselfish are under investigation. Volunteers will snorkel on the surface to observe what's happening. The trip is open to both qualified scuba divers and experienced snorkelers. Cost for two weeks is $1,545. Air fare is additional. Departures are July 1, July 22 and Aug. 12. For information, contact Earthwatch, P.O. Box 403, Watertown, Mass. 02272, (617) 926-8200. -- Take a cruise for divers and snorkelers only. Each fall Quark Expeditions offers a variety of special adventure cruises aboard small ships for divers and snorkelers only. On this year's itinerary are a trip to the islands of eastern Indonesia designed for divers only, and an expedition to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park of Australia. On the Indonesian voyage, passage is aboard the Island Explorer, which carries 36 guests in 18 air-conditioned cabins or suites. In the kitchen, three chefs blend international with Oriental cuisine. The vessel carries five large, inflatable boats that are used for diving, snorkeling and landing operations. Departure for the two-week cruise is Oct. 20 from Bali. Cost is $4,850 to $7,950 per person, plus air fare to Bali. On the Australian trip, passage is aboard the Elizabeth II, which carries 28 guests in 14 air-conditioned cabins with upper and lower bunks. Departure for the two-week cruise is Nov. 10. The price is $3,700 to $5,500 per person, plus air fare to Australia. Other diving cruises are planned to the Galapagos Islands on July 23, the Red Sea on May 19 and June 4 and the Solomon Islands on Aug. 11.

Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a petroleum importing country in the future.\" The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI] natural gas production and transport facilities in the Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java. Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the reserves of which are quite large, is very important. The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings, and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated. \"Natural gas has now become an important export commodity. No small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural gas exports,\" the chief of state said. Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the inauguration of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs. Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production and transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok. With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical industry. Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric power demand because of the progress of industrial development. If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization process will be hindered. The chief of state said that because of the importance of natural gas to future development, the government will keep encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to continue into order to meet long-term demand. \"There is a good possibility of this, because geologically Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am confident that, with the support of advances in science and technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new oil and gas in Indonesia,\" the chief of state said. It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI under production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of finding new oil and gas in the country. The chief of state said that in the development of oil and natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance their mutual benefit. In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive to exploration and production activity. Background At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11 years beginning in 1994. The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled steam power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a \"fast track\" by the direct appointment of an implementing contractor. The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial capital for phase one until production will be more than $300 million. For development through phase six, the total cost is estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89. Benefits Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon, Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas. Haji Djaelani, leader of the \"Abu Hurairah\" Islamic Boarding School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents of Pagerungan. \"Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular and Islamic, have now taken on a new look,\" he said. Similarly, a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his many thanks for the project. Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities: ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development] manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. \"I request communications facilities to facilitate my work,\" he said expectantly. The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The president asked the young man to take part in finding alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly monsoon. \"Find a good alternative--using other skills, naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the westerly monsoon.\" The regent of Sumenep also accompanied members of the community in the dialogue with the president.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FBIS4-52579", "score": 12.046799659729004}, {"content": "Title: Content: 940929 FT 29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwanese cast their nets wider -Pollution and overfishing has hit local catches Fishmongers at Keelung port's bustling fish market hawk scaly wares ranging from imported Norwegian salmon to Pacific tuna and squid caught off the Falkland Islands. Pollution and overfishing of nearby waters has forced Taiwanese fishermen to scour ever more distant shores. The catch of neighbouring China nearly tripled from 1981 to 1990 to become the world's biggest fisheries producer. Taiwan will soon sign an accord with the 15-nation South Pacific Forum allowing its fishermen uniform access to waters controlled by those countries, according to the country's ministerial-level Council of Agriculture. The South Pacific is an important fishing ground for Taiwan, especially for tuna and skipjack. Forum members are Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Fiji, Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru, Niue Island, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since the United Nations switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1971, Taiwan has encountered difficulties in securing fishing grounds, especially from countries with which it does not have diplomatic ties. In 1989 the quasi-governmental Overseas Fisheries Development Council was set up to negotiate fishing rights and help settle an escalating number of fishing disputes. The government has already secured fishing rights within the 200-mile coastal zones of South Africa, Tuvalu, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, all countries with which Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations. Commercial fishing agreements have so far been reached with over 20 countries or territories, of which those with Indonesia, India and the Falkland Islands are the most important. Talks are under way with several other countries including Vietnam and Burma. Although Taiwan does not appear in statistics compiled by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation, it ranked the 18th among fishing nations in 1990, and falls within the top five in production of both tuna and squid. Government efforts to curb growth in the domestic fishing industry cut the total catch to 1.317m tonnes in 1991 from a 1990 peak of 1.455m. But production has risen since. Taiwan, a major fish exporter, sold just over a quarter of its catch overseas in 1993. Tuna dominated exports and the biggest markets were Japan, Thailand and the US. Fish imports have grown to meet increased domestic consumption resulting from economic growth. Official figures show that Taiwan's imports more than doubled over the past decade. Unofficial imports from China are also on the rise. Taiwanese fishermen either pick up their illicit cargo from Chinese ports or buy the fish from Chinese boats at sea and smuggle it into ports such as Keelung. With nearby waters depleted, nearly 60 per cent of the 1993 catch came from distant seas. Tuna caught in distant seas through long-lining jumped 80 per cent in 1993 from 1992. Last year's catch of squid, caught by a type of hook-and-line method called zigging, climbed 22 per cent. The two species combined comprised one-third of the total catch last year. Despite Taiwan's pariah diplomatic status, which prevents it from joining international organisations, the government generally complies with international maritime and fishing conventions. For instance, it banned whaling in 1983 and in 1993, it outlawed drift net fishing following a United Nations resolution against the practice. As competition grows fiercer for fewer fish, Taiwanese fishing boats have encountered numerous disputes over fishing grounds from the South China Sea to the South Atlantic. Recognising the problems of overfishing, the government in 1989 instituted a policy of trying to contain growth of the fishing industry. Through restrictions on boat-building and a boat buyback programme Taiwan's fleet was cut to 28,880 vessels last year from peak of 32,340 in 1990.

While some people imagine that in Australia koalas hang from the trees like grapes and that kangaroos line up waving \"welcome\" signs, it just isn't so. Granted, the country has scores of zoos and animal parks where you can see everything from wombats to Tasmanian Devils, but ogling zoo-ified beasties simply is not the same as viewing them in the wild. To do that, you come here, to Kangaroo Island. The island lies about 70 miles southwest of Adelaide, about nine miles off the South Australia coast. It is Australia's third-largest island, after Tasmania and Melville Island in the Northern Territory, and has been called \"Australia in microcosm\" -- the place to go when you want to see all of the country but don't have the time. Shaped something like a startled turtle, its head extended toward the mainland, the island is about 95 miles long and 35 miles wide at its widest point. It's a sparsely populated place, with what passes for urban life concentrated in three small towns on the east coast: Kingscote, the largest with a population of about 2,000, and the two smaller communities of American River and Penneshaw. I first heard about Kangaroo Island from an Australian friend who used to talk about its immense cliffs that reared up from the surf like the ramparts of a medieval castle, and about its beautiful, pristine beaches. He talked of scuba diving in search of treasure in the ribs of pirate ships, and of the odd little fairy penguins. Since the island lies only about nine miles across the Backstairs Passage from Cape Jervis south of Adelaide (where I had gone to sample Australian wines), I decided to see for myself whether it lived up to my friend's description. I was met at the airport in Kingscote by Peter Telfer, the 40-year-old owner of Adventure Charters of Kangaroo Island, which had been highly recommended by Tourism South Australia. Telfer, who grew up on the island, has parlayed years of personal exploration into a first-class tour and guide service. His chosen mode of transport is a high-off-the-ground, four-wheel drive vehicle complete with \"roo bars,\" the Australian equivalent of roll bars except that they wrap around the front of the vehicle. Joining us for the first day of my two-day island tour was Marion Saunders, a friend of Telfer's and a former islander herself. Two days was all I had, but to thoroughly explore the island and discover why its residents fight so hard to keep it unspoiled one really needs a week or more. Kangaroo Island has been isolated from the mainland since the last Ice Age, and its flora and fauna has therefore escaped the ravages of such introduced species as the fox and rabbit or the predations of the dingo. As a result, wildlife flourishes, and visitors can find kangaroos, including one species unique to the island, goannas (large lizards), native cats called quolls, short-nosed bandicoots (a rat-like marsupial), pygmy possums and wallabies in vast abundance, as well as seals, sea lions, fairy penguins, koalas, emus, echidnas, platypuses and an Eden of rainbow-colored birds. The scenery is as varied as the animal life. Much of the interior is farmland tucked between gentle hills. Sheep and various crops failed when first introduced, but after the soil was improved with minerals, agriculture thrived. Away from the cultivated areas, farms give way to scrubland and even desert. On the coast, rocky cliffs alternate with white-sand beaches. Island wildflowers include orchids, blue asters, golden wattle, rice flowers, fuchsia and purple fringe lilies. My home base on the island was Kingscote on Nepean Bay, where I saw South Australia's largest mulberry tree and very little else. To those with more time, Kingscote, the state's first settlement, does have a good folk-history museum and heritage walking trail. Day one was an exploration of the northern part of the island. Our first stop was alongside a tiny creek shaded by flowering eucalyptus trees, where Telfer promised we'd see koalas. Sure enough, there they were, draped like drunks in the gum trees. Saunders claimed that the gum leaves they eat are narcotic, and the reason they look so spaced out is because they're genuinely zonked. Others dispute this and the debate goes on. While Telfer set traps in the creek for \"yabbies\" (an Australian freshwater crayfish), Saunders and I followed kangaroo tracks along the creek. The variety and color of the birds we saw was stunning: rainbow lorikeets, scarlet robins, rosellas and galahs swept from tree to tree in large flocks. Galahs, a type of cockatoo, are considered a somewhat dimwitted bird, and Australians use the name as a term of derision. To visitors, though, the sight of the pink and dove-gray birds flying wild is a delight. Just as we settled in to sample Telfer's barbecue, Saunders pointed out some black-and-white animals in the distance. \"Feral goats,\" she said. On Kangaroo Island, the word feral (wild) ranks with some of our more colorful expletives. Any introduced animal that can upset the island's ecological balance really upsets the native islanders. Later, Saunders pointed out pine trees from North America that are gradually taking over from the native gum trees. One introduced species that has been accepted is the Ligurian bee. No other bee has been introduced since 12 hives were brought to Kangaroo Island in 1881 from the Italian province of Liguria. So the Ligurian strain has remained pure. Today it is a unique species and is exported to apiaries around the world. Kangaroo Island's attractions hug the coastline. On the northern (and less frequented) shore, we climbed Constitution Hill for a bird's-eye view of Snelling Beach. Just east of the hill, we walked through a tunnel formed by a jumble of limestone boulders to emerge on a sweeping sandy beach with a small lagoon formed by protective rocks. This is Stokes Bay, where fairy penguins come in the spring to have their chicks. There were no penguins there during our visit, but we did see plovers, red-billed oyster catchers, cormorants, ducks and sooty pied oyster catchers. Kangaroo Island was named by English navigator Matthew Flinders in 1802. Its first occupants -- not including the aborigines who had lived there centuries before but later abandoned the island -- were bands of deserters from English, French and American whaling ships and escapees from the prison colonies. Together, they formed marauding bands of cutthroats called \"straitsmen\" or \"sea rats.\" With Kangaroo Island as their base, these pirates roamed the Australian coast in whaleboats, raiding villages, kidnapping women, plundering ships and murdering crews. At sunset, we stopped high on the Wisanger Hills to enjoy a view straight out of Africa: sweeping fields of dry grass and scattered trees, with only the sound of the wind to break the silence. On the second day of my visit, we picked up another visitor and then set off for Seal Bay, a 2,000-acre conservation area where a breeding colony of more than 300 sea lions lay around on the sand barking and basking. Because of constant contact with friendly islanders and the absence of predators, the animals regard people as curiosities and not much more. The sea lions and New Zealand fur seals waddle on the sand and barely raise a brown eye as visitors walk by or pose for pictures near them. Even though the mammals take only passing interest in people, it's a good idea to get there early in the morning before the crowds -- or what passes for crowds -- arrive. It's also advisable not to tease the animals, and to be wary of a mother separated from her pup or an amorous male in the February mating season. Near Seal Bay are Vivonne Bay and Hanson Bay, two more of what seems an endless stretch of perfect beaches -- great for picnics, bathing, fishing or for launching a scuba diving trip. More than 60 wrecked ships have been found around the island's 280-mile coastline, and that, coupled with coral reefs and clean water, makes this a scuba diver's mecca. Just beyond Vivonne Bay is the Little Sahara Desert, an oasis of folding white sand dunes surrounded by bush. Continuing west, Kelly Hill Conservation Park is a haven for birds and animals, and the Kelly Hill Caves offer conducted tours through the calcite formations. Then, just a bit farther west, we arrived at the Remarkable Rocks. Nature, over the centuries, weathered the massive rock formations so that what emerged was a collection of weird and surreal towers and forms, precariously balanced on a huge granite dome that plunges 90 feet down to the sea. Nearby Admiral's Arch is another work of nature -- an immense cave carved by the wind and sea. The best time to see it is in February when hundreds of seals and sea lions and their pups use the area for swimming classes. At the end of the island we stopped for lunch at Rocky River, headquarters of the 185,000-acre Flinders Chase National Park. Here, it is the visitors who are fenced off while the animals hop, waddle, strut and crawl around looking for handouts. Under some gum trees, we pulled out a bag of cut-up apples. Young kangaroos hopped up and gently took the apples from our hands with their paws. Emus strut around among the visitors and an echidna roams around in circles not really knowing where it's going. Koalas sit in the trees, zonked as usual, Cape Barren geese parade around posing for the camera, and galahs, lorikeets and cockatoos scream from the trees. The park is also home to about 150 of the rare Glossy Black or Casuarina cockatoo that are found only in Australia, but we weren't fortunate enough to spot one. Still, that -- not to mention my failure to sight the elusive platypus -- gave me the incentive to pay another visit to Kangaroo Island in the future.

'In the South Atlantic,' I would reply. 'Ah,' they said knowingly, 'near the Falklands.' WELL, NO, actually. It is about 4,000 miles from the Falkland Islands, bang in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, nearly 1,000 miles south of the equator, some 1,100 miles from Angola to the east and 1,800 miles from Brazil to the west. The nearest landfall is Ascension Island, 700 miles to the north, and St Helena can only be reached by sea, two days' sail from Ascension and five days from Cape Town. Its very remoteness and inaccessibility were the principal reasons that it was chosen by the British government for Napoleon's exile. St Helena was discovered by the Portuguese admiral Juan de Nova Castella on May 21 1502, the feast-day of Saint Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine. It continued in relative obscurity for another century-and-a-half, though it became prosperous as a port of call for ships trading with the East. Situated in the south-east trade winds, it was a stopover for ships rounding the Cape of Good Hope to revictual and take on fresh water. The British laid claim to it in 1659 and the East India Company was granted a charter by Charles II to administer it, until in 1834 it was brought under the direct rule of the British crown. With the construction of the Suez Canal and the invention of the steam ship, St Helena's importance declined, and the island is now entirely dependent on the UK government. The St Helena plies between Cardiff and Cape Town, calling at Tenerife and Ascension Island before reaching St Helena some two weeks later. Once a year she calls at Tristan da Cunha, the remotest and most sparsely populated of all British territories. She is a jolly little ship to travel on, carrying both passengers and cargo. She is the essential lifeline between St Helena and Britain, carrying everything from food to cars to mail. The ship also carries much longed-for fresh fruit on her return journey from Cape Town. The passengers are divided between those who are having the trip of a lifetime, often recently retired, those who are taking up posts on the island, and St Helenians returning home. The St Helena is a very friendly ship, the affable crew, partly British, partly St Helenian, making life on board a riot of fun. There are deck games, films and bingo, as well as a quiet lounge in which to read. Approaching from Ascension Island, excitement mounts to fever pitch among the home-bound St Helenians as the dot on the horizon is gradually revealed as a cloud-capped volcanic rock rising sheer from the surrounding sea. How Napoleon's heart must have sunk when he saw those formidable cliffs and realised that this time there was to be no escape. The port and capital of the island is Jamestown, named after King James II. The actual landing process is hazardous: after clambering down the companion way one is conveyed in a small motor boat from the ship to the slippery wharf steps where one is obliged to hang on to a rope and jump when the sailors say so. Failure to obey has been known to result in a ducking. Those unable to negotiate this obstacle are put in a large container, lowered over the side and landed like cargo. Having negotiated the landing, and been through Customs, one walks through an archway emblazoned with the coat of arms of the East India Company into Jamestown proper. The capital (pop: 1,500) boasts just one street - Main Street - with the castle, seat of government, police station, library, courts of justice, Anglican church, museum, post office, two hotels and shops and houses prettily painted in Portofino colours. The Consulate hotel is an elegant, white-painted building with blue filigree ironwork pillars and verandahs. It is here that le tout St Helena assembles twice a day to drink and chat (except on Sundays, when everything closes down). The hotel was originally built about 1780, but along with the other buildings in Jamestown was ravaged by white ants which were inadvertently and disastrously introduced on to the island in the broken-up timbers from a captured Brazilian slave-ship. The hotel was rebuilt in 1863 in stone, iron and teakwood, which is unpalatable to white ants. Mangoes and avocadoes grow in the bougainvillaea-hung garden. Out of Jamestown it is uphill all the way, whether on foot or by winding narrow roads. Jacob's Ladder is a spectacular sheer ascent, 699 concrete steps leading to the top of Ladder Hill, the shortest way to a coronary. Winding up the single track road by car is more leisurely, although expertise in reversing is required, since the rule of the road dictates that the ascending car should give way to the descending. Progress is therefore slow, but as few people are in a hurry it does not matter. Drivers and passengers wave genially at each other. With a population of only 6,000, it is not surprising that nearly every driver of the perhaps 2,000 cars knows one another. (On my return to Britain, I continued to wave to other drivers, but their reaction - incredulity to outright hostility - caused me to desist). Jamestown is the warmest and most humid part of the island. The temperature can drop sharply as one ascends into 'the country.' There is a turn in the road called Button-Up Corner where men on horseback supposedly buttoned up their jackets against the cool breeze. The weather can change dramatically: one moment bright sunshine, the next mist or driving rain. St Helena, which is 10 miles long and six broad, has unsurpassed views: the sea is almost always visible, glittering in the sun or storm-tossed. The uplands alternate between bare volcanic rock and lush pastures. In the early part of this century there was a massive planting scheme of New Zealand flax, in an attempt to grow an exportable crop, but the invention of synthetic fibres put paid to that; the huge spiky flax plants are gradually being replaced by an afforestation scheme, principally of eucalyptus and conifers, to help prevent soil erosion. The plants and animals of St Helena are plentiful, though the wind militates against all but the keenest domestic gardener. Mynah birds are everywhere, chattering and gossiping, and little ring doves peck boldly at your feet. Rarer are the brilliant red cardinals and yellow cape canaries. The wirebird, an unlovely plover-like creature which scuttles rather than flies, is an essential sighting for tourists, since it is found nowhere else but St Helena. The supreme place of pilgrimage is the house where Napoleon was semi-incarcerated. The original document, dated May 1816, ordering his detention as a prisoner of war, may be seen in the attorney-general's archives. Napoleon lived at Longwood House in imperial state, with his retinue, but his life was a misery, constantly spied upon and discourteously treated by the governor. Finally he became seriously ill. He died in May 1821, aged 52, and was buried with full military honours. The long melancholy walk down to the tomb is peopled by ghosts. After Napoleon's death the house was abandoned, but it has since been restored to its original state, and many artefacts have been returned or borrowed from France to fill out the historical picture. The garden, too, under the supervision of the French consul, who lives at Longwood, has been replanted, and both house and garden are open to the public. The tourist who leaves the ship for only a day will be conducted round St Helena in a 1928 Cadillac, acquiring at least a superficial overview. Those who leave the ship whilst it sails to Cape Town and back will have two weeks to enjoy the sights and get to know the friendliest people on earth. 'Saints' are a racial mixture, reflecting St Helena's trade with the East, so that there are discernible Chinese, Malaysian and Indian features, as well as Portuguese and Dutch from the early traders. There is also a dash of African blood from the slave ships which were intercepted en route to America. English is spoken with a purity heard only in remote country districts of Britain. The sights for the day tripper will include Plantation House, the home of the governor. It is an elegant 18th century country house whose grounds are open to the public. The main attraction is Jonathan, a 162-year-old tortoise the size and weight of a small tank, and his satellites Myrtle, David, Emma and Fredrica, which browse on the lawn in front of the house and permit their necks to be scratched. A more extensive tour would be required to visit the ruins of High Knoll fort, which stands on a peak overlooking the northern approach, built by the British to defend the island against invaders. Two spectacular basalt columns, quaintly named Lot and Lot's Wife, dominate the rocky volcanic landscape from almost any viewpoint. Probably the best way to get to know the island is on foot. There are peaks to climb and cliffs to scale, as well as more gentle ascents for the less athletic. One such is Flagstaff Hill, the breathtaking view from the top being well worth the effort. From there one can see a huge hump-backed hill called The Barn on the edge of which, to the eye of faith, can be discerned the profile of Napoleon. Two principal features of St Helena linger in the mind: the extraordinary scenery, switching from pastoral to bleak and back again in minutes; and the people, warm, friendly, dignified, courteous, honest and fiercely proud of their island and its history.

But an event that took place off the US west coast 25 years ago has a particular relevance to residents of environmentally sensitive seaside areas in the UK such as Christchurch. In 1969, a blow-out at an offshore production platform left 30 miles of beach near Santa Barbara, one of southern California's main tourist destinations, covered in oil pollution. The impact of the spill on public opinion was such that development of the state's rich offshore oilfields was curtailed for decades, while the political fallout from it is felt even now. Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, recently confirmed that residents of coastal states still have a virtual veto over new offshore oil developments. The Santa Barbara spill has also had a lasting effect on how the international oil industry operates in sensitive coastal areas, including those in the UK. Over the next few years, oil companies plan to increase inshore exploration drilling, encouraged by coastal discoveries such as the Wytch Farm oilfield near Poole in Dorset and the Liverpool Bay natural gas field. In last year's 14th licensing round, the government included a large number of inshore blocks, many of which are located near well-known coastal beauty spots, important fishing or breeding grounds, or in areas which support endangered species. But the special requirements of operating inshore often conflict with established ways of working in the North Sea, according to Geoff Nicholson, manager of near-shore exploration projects for Elf Enterprise, a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the biggest UK independent. It has been active in Poole Bay on the south coast and is about to begin exploration in the Irish Sea, 15 miles off Anglesey. 'The industry likes to move fast and with few constraints,' he says. In the North Sea, the sudden availability of a drilling rig at an attractive rate can cause companies to alter plans overnight. In the exploration phase, oil companies also tend to operate at an arm's length through specialist contractors. 'But you can't operate like that inshore,' says Nicholson. 'Long periods of consultation with local governments and community groups are necessary before actual operations, such as seismic surveys or drilling, can begin.' Senior Elf executives say it is as important to understand the 'geo-political aspects' of England's south coast as it is of south Yemen or the other remote locations in which the oil industry operates. Elf's emphasis on the careful identification and cultivation of community groups is no accident. In 1992, its initial exploration efforts in Poole Bay ended in angry confrontations at sea between seismic survey ships and local fishermen. The company had reached an early agreement on compensating those who fished for crab and lobster. But it struggled to reach an understanding with the trawlermen. 'We first had to define who was a fisherman,' says Nicholson. 'In the winter someone might be a painter and decorator, but in summer they might do a little fishing.' In addition, some political pressure groups saw the chance to use Elf's dispute with the fishermen to their own advantage. Elf eventually had to pay out more than Pounds 1m in compensation to the fishermen. 'We had to solve the dispute on the run and in a very unsatisfactory way,' concedes Nicholson. The problems of dealing with 10 different fishing associations persuaded the company to set up and fund a forum in which to channel problems. It also provides a mechanism for arbitration. The fragmented nature of the fishing industry made it the most difficult for Elf to deal with. But many other groups also saw the company as a threat. Some were concerned that even the hint of an oil spill offshore in summer could do long-lasting damage to the area's important tourist industry. Others simply did not want oil companies operating in their back yard. 'I don't care if you drink your bloody oil,' was the attitude of one resident at a public meeting. Late last year, Elf drilled an exploratory well, the results of which it has yet to divulge. The licence for Poole Bay was issued in an earlier round, but Elf observed many of the environmental conditions set by the government for 14th round licences. Seabed studies were carried out both before and after drilling to determine if there was any damage to marine life. A narrower than usual well was specified to cut down on the amount of rock cuttings brought to the surface. Water-based drilling muds were used when possible in preference to oil-based ones to lubricate the drill bit. Rock cuttings brought to the surface were cleaned before being dispersed over a wide area - rather than piled on the sea bottom - to avoid smothering fish feeding grounds. And the normal stand-by safety vessel was augmented by one carrying a chemical dispersant and booms to contain any spills. Local officials say such precautions have made inshore exploration drilling acceptable to the public. But they say the prospect of permanent platforms within sight of land is no more acceptable now than in 1988 when a British Petroleum proposal to build an artificial island off Wytch Farm to tap the offshore extension of the field triggered a storm of protest along the south coast. New technology, in the form of horizontal drilling from a land base to a point more than 5km offshore, solved BP's problem. But technology is unlikely to offer a solution in all cases. At some time in the next few years an inshore discovery could be made that will test whether coastal residents in the UK have a similar power of veto as their counterparts in California.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT942-7547", "score": 11.817299842834473}, {"content": "Title: Content: 930205 FT 05 FEB 93 / Observer: Uncomfortable Bad news for all of you who thought the dispute over the ownership of the Falkland Islands had gone away.

Any boat trip to an island is an adventure. Every island is magical in its way - some, of course, more magical than others. And an island is a lovely setting for a story: you can concentrate so much action, so much emotion, in a small space.' The veteran children's novelist John Rowe Townsend is of course claiming imaginative kinship with Robert Louis Stevenson, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe and other authors of island stories. Townsend's particular island is an imaginary one, but its geographical location and its physical features - bleak, treeless, volcanic - help us to locate it somewhere in the south Atlantic, somewhere, in fact, like Tristan da Cunha. His first attempt to present the island's history came with The Islanders, first published in 1981 and reissued as a companion volume this month. That book described the life of a small, hard-bitten community that followed its own peculiar customs and traditions, one of which was never to help a stranger. It ended with the islanders being obliged to reject this age-old tradition, - and thus learning new truths about themselves. Now John Rowe Townsend has returned to that same pitiless spot in a sequel entitled The Invaders, and the task he has now set himself is to describe what would happen if that same small community, generations on, were to find itself face to face with some of the problems and challenges of life in the 20th century. It begins once again with the arrival of a stranger from the Mother Colony, an orphaned boy who claims kinship with one of the island's families. The boy's grandfather had described the place to him as a paradise of sorts, but Cyril finds it a windswept, desolate spot and the inhabitants with whom he claims kinship unwelcoming. He is obliged to share his first night's sleeping accommodation with a goat, and to eat fish and potatoes, the islanders' staple diet, day after wearisome day. But soon all begins to change - and at a fearful pace. The boy introduces the islanders to some of the marvels of the present age - including the wireless set that he has brought with him. And it is thanks to this wireless that the islanders learn that their time-honoured way of life is soon to be destroyed forever by invading forces from the nearby Republic of Santa Cruz. At this point parallels with the Falklands conflict begin to come at us thick and fast; the dictator of Santa Cruz, Gomez, lays claim to the island and threatens occupation, a bravura gesture that is intended as much to impress his enemies at home. The Mother Country sends a garrison, led by the vociferous Brigadier Culpepper whose head is stuffed with the manners and vocabulary of the Great War. But the colonial regime is short-lived. The Mother Country's garrison withdraws, and the island is soon occupied by a contingent from Santa Cruz. The island is renamed Gomez, and the Mother Country, surprisingly, seems quite indifferent to its fate. And throughout all these fearful, tension-racked months modernity continues to creep up on the inhabitants: the young people learn rebellion; the old discover what it is to deal with benign enemies and seeming friends. In short, they learn lessons in politics and duplicity. The climax comes with the hair's breadth escape of the Brigadier, his daughter and the remaining islanders as the island's volcano, long dormant, erupts into destructive life.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT923-812", "score": 11.701000213623047}, {"content": "Title: Content: 910416 FT 16 APR 91 / Argentine ambitions founder off Tierra del Fuego: An ill-conceived scheme to promote industrial development at the ends of the earth IN 1972 Argentine strategists announced that security and geopolitical priorities made it essential to establish a large permanent settlement on the remote island of Tierra del Fuego, which is divided between Argentina and Chile. They decided to establish a duty-free zone and offered tax incentives to attract industry. Nineteen years and millions of dollars later, the ill-conceived plan is finally being abandoned as Argentina embraces free trade. As a result, Ushuaia and Rio Grande, the population of the island's only towns, are shrinking daily. Ushuaia, a port of about 30,000 people set between the Beagle Channel and the southernmost ranges of the Andes, became home to five screwdriver plants notorious for their poorly crafted and over-priced consumer durables. Now, the end of incentives and the advent of trade liberalisation could spell the end for the factories and the 5,000 jobs they provide. Mr Hugo Iglesias, general manager of Bencer SA, Ushuaia's largest company, said 'if our protection from imports is ended I would say it spells the end for the economic development of Tierra del Fuego. Companies will implode.' Recession has already reduced sales severely and most factories operate at only 20 per cent of capacity. If the industrialisation of Tierra del Fuego made little economic sense, it has at least eased the worries of Argentina's military planners. Strategists in Buenos Aires have always been anxious to settle Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego because they suspect Chile covets the under-populated but resource-rich region. Hardy Chilean immigrants, who do the menial and labouring jobs the Argentines refuse to do, have always been in a majority. At one time about 90 per cent of Argentine Tierra del Fuego's population was Chilean. Now it is estimated at 'only' 60 per cent. In 1978 the two countries, then run by right-wing military governments, almost went to war over control of the Beagle Channel. The immediate 'threat' from Chile faded following Argentina's acceptance in 1984 of Papal arbitration awarding three minuscule islands in the Beagle Channel to Chile. However, Argentine Tierra del Fuego is trying to assert a new strategic importance as the focal point of Argentina's territorial claims in Antarctica and the South Atlantic. Formally, Tierra del Fuego has 'jurisdiction' over a region covering 495,000 square miles, which includes the Falkland Islands, three other British-held island groups in the South Atlantic as well as a section of Antarctica. Maps of the region carry the legend 'Tierra del Fuego - geographical centre of a country we must consolidate.' However, the virtually insolvent government in Buenos Aires has little time for Tierra del Fuego's territorial ambitions. It can no longer afford to sustain the expensive and notoriously corrupt incentives schemes. On April 1, the duty free zone became practically meaningless when the government replaced formerly insurmountable trade barriers to imported electronic goods with a single 22 per cent tariff as part of a general trade liberalisation policy. Overnight, Tierra del Fuego was priced out of the market. A 20-inch television set made on the island retailed in Buenos Aires for Dollars 855 (Pounds 483). A similar set imported from Japan and sold in the Chilean half of Tierra del Fuego, which is also a duty free zone, retails for less than half the price. Naturally, there are few homes in Ushuaia equipped with locally-made goods. Mr Mario Muia, manager of Continental SACIF, which makes televisions, video cassette recorders and audio systems, said Tierra del Fuego 'is not a good deal any more. It's practically impossible to compete with imports.' Mr Muia, who admits to being the proud owner of an imported Sony stereo, warned darkly of 'social disaster' on the island unless the trade policy was reversed. However, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, retorts that the companies have 90 per cent profit margins, and says there is scope for them to compete. Less charitable observers say the companies made even larger profits by manipulating the incentive regulations. There is little else to sustain the island's economy. Buenos Aires, its only market, lies thousands of kilometres away at the other end of a highway which includes long stretches of rutted and potholed dirt roads that are closed for weeks in the winter. Most of the island's food is sent from Buenos Aires, although it is fertile and its waters abound in fish. If the screwdriver plants do close, what will become of Tierra del Fuego? Before, it was home to thousands of sheep, a prison colony and a naval base. Tourism, the region's boosters say, is the obvious alternative.

One of the interesting areas is the tip of the Otago Peninsula near Dunedin on New Zealand's South Island, where travelers can visit the Royal Albatross colony and Penguin Place. The budget traveler who is interested in the South Island of New Zealand and its popular albatross and penguin colonies can arrange for minivan transportation at the Stafford Gables youth hostel in Dunedin. Without the minivan ride, travelers would have to supply their own transportation or join a tour. They would also be faced with a five-mile hike from the bus stop at Portobello to the Royal Albatross colony at Taiaroa Head. To avoid disturbing the wildlife at the colony, which is close to civilization, the number of visitors is restricted. Before travelers go, they should get details at the hostel and arrange for tickets. Pick a windy day for the best sightings, because the albatross need a 15- to 20-knot wind to get airborne. At the site there is a reception building with information. At nearby Penguin Place, after paying a small entrance fee, visitors can see \"yellow-eyed\" penguins and \"fur\" seals. Best sightings are after 5 p.m. The minivan for guests at Stafford Gables in Dunedin, second largest city on South Island, operates from October to April. Open all day, the hostel is at 71 Stafford St. The telephone number is (024) 741-919. It has family, twin and dormitory accommodations from about $9.50 per night. This is one of 50 hostels in New Zealand affiliated with the International Youth Hostel Federation. In addition, there are 75 independent facilities referred to as \"backpackers accommodation,\" which offer beds in small dormitory rooms, plus twin and double rooms. Rates for these facilities range from $5 to $9.50 per night, with no age restrictions. New Zealand also has 12 national parks on the North and South islands, the largest being Fiordland with 3 million acres. Considering the availability of all these parks, one of the most popular pastimes in New Zealand is walking or hiking. Walks can range from an afternoon in a Kauri forest to several days exploring lush rain forests and alpine passes. In Fiordland, there are more than 300 miles of developed trails. Instead of walking alone, arrangements can be made to walk with a group. Only a day-pack is needed because meals and bedding are prearranged at lodges each evening. Travelers also can participate in \"freedom walking\" -- carrying their own food and sleeping bags and paying only for use of backcountry huts and transportation to and from the trailheads. Throughout New Zealand there are more than 850 huts that provide simple shelter with mattresses, bunks and cooking facilities, for $2.50 to $8 per night. The best time to hike is October to March. Holiday crowds arrive in January and February. Travelers will find much information about South Island in a new 446-page edition of the \"New Zealand Handbook\" by Jane King, which contains 81 maps.

The examples are legion. Rather than downgrade subtly the quality of the Argentine delegation to the Non-Aligned Movement, as a diplomat might have advised, he pulls Argentina out with a grand fanfare. Rather than wait for an invitation to visit Britain, which would certainly have been forthcoming in time, he announces, through the medium of the FT, a plan to pay a visit to the UK in 1992, an election year and the 10th anniversary of the Falklands war. (The visit seems likely to take place in 1993.) In contrast to the awkward reaction of most Latin American governments to the crisis in the Gulf, Mr Menem sends two warships to support the US-led coalition. He also followed the hard US line on Cuba, breaking ranks with the rest of Latin America. Mr Menem is telling the world that Argentina is a changed country; that the 60 years of isolationism which marked Argentina's foreign policy is over. He is seeking to bury Argentina's reputation as an unreliable player on the world's diplomatic stage. Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, argues that 'Argentina's internal and its international policies are a unity'. In other words, a democratic, open economy requires a different foreign policy from a closed economy run by a dictator. The wide-ranging manifestations of this policy include: Alignments: Argentina has aligned itself more closely to the west. This was initially seen as a pro-Washington tilt to policy, an interpretation disliked in both Washington and Buenos Aires. More recently, there has been emphasis on relations with Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of external trade compared with 15 per cent in the US. Family ties with Europe are strong - more than 1m Argentines are also citizens of EC countries. International agreements: Argentina has professed an intention to comply with a wide range of these that it had previously refused to sign. In April President Menem signed a decree placing strict controls on the export of sensitive materials. The government has signed agreements with Brazil on nuclear inspection, and with Brazil and Chile on banning nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The nuclear safeguards laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have been adopted. The government has made a commitment to the US to abandon the Condor missile project, expressed a desire to join the Missile Technology Control Regime and committed itself to nuclear non-proliferation and the Tlatelolco treaty which banks nuclear weapons in Latin America. It has also signed treaties on international investment protection. Despite all this, many of these commitments have yet to be ratified by the Argentine Congress. Furthermore, there will remain some doubts about the ability of the government to force compliance on the military of some of these agreements. Nonetheless, the reaction from Washington has been positive. The US has said that some 20 Skyhawk jets are available to the Argentine air force, the first indication of US willingness to combat aircraft to Argentina since the Falklands War. Relations with neighbouring countries: Argentina has eased historically tense relations with Brazil and Chile. This has a strong economic motive. The government is intent on economic integration with Brazil, the key to which is Mercosur, a customs union of the two economies with Uruguay and Paraguay. That is scheduled to begin in 1995, though its implementation may be delayed. The hope is that Chile will join the group once Brazil's economic problems abate. But there is little doubt that the excitement in Argentina over integration with Brazil is not matched in Brazil. There are also some worries that Mercosur may restrict Argentina's ability to act unilaterally over trade matters, for example, in discussing a free trade agreement with the US. However, given the openness of the Argentine and the Chilean economies, and the growing outward orientation of Brazil, further economic integration appears inevitable with or without agreements among governments. Companies from the three countries are already discussing mergers and joint venture agreements, and Chilean companies have already been buyers (of two power stations) in the Argentine privatisation programme. Relations with the UK: Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Britain in July 1990. These had been broken with the invasion of the Falkland Islands 10 years ago. That was also the key to improving relations with the European Community. With the issue of sovereignty under a so-called umbrella - meaning both sides retain their claim to sovereignty - fairly cordial discussions between London and Buenos Aires have moved ahead on the practical issues of fishing rights and aviation. There has been less progress on the more difficult issue of oil exploration rights. Mr Guido di Tella, the Argentine foreign minister, has also said that the desires of the islanders will be taken into account in a settlement, a statement viewed as constructive in London. While Britain retains a garrison of 2,000 men on the islands that the Argentines know as the Malvinas, Argentina must be considered now neither to have the intent nor the military capability to invade. Thus the only risk to the 2,100 islanders is the small one of an attack by some maverick force. The Argentines have not given up on their claim to the islands, however, and the war remains a traumatic experience over which they still agonise. Since there is little chance of the British parliament cutting a deal over sovereignty over the heads of the islanders, the Argentine government appears to have embarked on a longer-term strategy of reducing the islanders' fear of things Argentine. If this is so, policy towards the Falklands fits neatly with the rest of Argentine foreign policy: to convince the world that Argentina is now a democratic, stable and reliable member of the community of nations.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT922-8324", "score": 11.624600410461426}, {"content": "Title: Content: 930127 FT 27 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentine company denies threat to Falklands squid ARGENTINA'S LEADING commercial fishing company says the illex squid - life-blood of the Falkland Islands economy - is under no threat from overfishing. 'The illex is underexploited, not overexploited,' according to Mr Mario Olaciregui, president of the Harengus fishing group. Although he lacks scientific data to support his claim, Mr Olaciregui says the first of his six squid boats began fishing on Thursday, just as the season opened, and found the vessel was quickly overloaded. 'There is enough illex for everyone,' he insists. 'This is based on empirical observation.' Harengus has fished for squid for years, catching 12,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year. It has found that squid availability varies very little. Mr Olaciregui adds that the illex market is limited to Japan, South Korea, Spain and Italy, so demand is reasonably stable. In December, Argentina announced that it would offer licences for foreign ships to fish for illex squid in its waters - in direct competition with the Falkand Islands, which in 1987 set up a highly lucrative licensing regime. The islanders say the illex is a delicate resource, which if overfished could be eliminated. Mr John Barton, Falklands director of fisheries, said yesterday: 'Fishing pressure is already very high and we firmly believe that a moderate increase in fishing effort will lead to a collapse of the stock.'

It is not true, as Aguilera asserts, that the islanders' income from fishing in the Malvinas \"will probably increase with the entry into effect... of another ocean zone, known as the Falkland Outer Conservation Zone (FOCZ).\" Aguilera bases this statement on a comment attributed to the Falklands governor who, \"based on this fact, was assessing the possibility of extending the fishing season and increasing by 10 percent the number of fishing licenses to be granted in 1994.\" The truth, however, is quite different. For a start, we are not referring to a \"London Treaty,\" but to a mere fishing agreement that may or may not be renewed every year. Secondly, in this agreement we have made sure that Great Britain limits to 150,000 tonnes the amount of fish extracted this season. It does not matter where it fishes, either in the new zone established by a common agreement with Argentina or in the ones previously agreed upon; Great Britain cannot surpass the aforementioned amount, and therefore the establishment of the FOCZ will not cause any \"damage.\" Moreover, it could well benefit Argentine fishing, because every ship the islanders send to the new zone will help reduce the number of ships operating between the islands and the continent -- up to now the busiest zone -- which will clearly benefit Argentine ships and help preserve the resources. As for the comment by David Tatham, it by no means entails increasing fishing above the 150,000 tonnes ceiling. In spite of what the article says, all it does is announce the price they will charge for each fishing license and a longer term for each permit -- factors related to their commercial policy, always within the fixed 150,000 tonnes limit... Argentina, in turn, has similar variables, and I would say much better ones than what the aforementioned article suggests. Thanks to our comparative advantages, better infrastructure, and a growing operative efficiency, we can offer licenses for longer periods at more attractive prices. This fact, during the past two years, has been reflected in clear Argentine leadership in that fishing region. Something that is not mentioned in Aguilera's article -- which is so gloomy about the government's action -- is that right from the beginning of these annual fishing agreements, Great Britain has maintained the 150,000 tonne ceiling while the Argentine ceiling has done nothing but rise. This year it has risen to 220,000 tonnes, which will allow an income equivalent to almost half our traditional beef exports. It is also not true that the establishment of the FOCZ will be necessarily negative because the preservation zone has been turned into an exploitation zone. We are talking about renewable resources, where preservation measures are justified if fishing reaches the point of depredation. But if the volumes set by the two countries do not together threaten the preservation of resources, all that is allegedly being preserved ends up lost with no benefit accruing to anyone. Every year Argentina and Great Britain carry out joint investigations and coordinate their own predictions to scientifically assess the total fishing volume within the preservation limits. If this coordinated policy determines the need to ban fishing in a given zone, this is decided on a yearly basis. For the time being the market demand does not threaten this resource being exploited jointly. Neither is it true that the fishing boom [preceding word in English] represents a true and permanent increase in the islanders' income. Quite the contrary, as the very charts published by Aguilera show: Since these fishing agreement with Argentina were signed, the British volumes have done nothing but drop: 44 million pounds in 1991, 40 in 1992, and 31 in 1993. Fishing is, in fact, very important for the islanders (it represents 49 percent of their income) and they are perfectly aware that maintaining these conditions depends, in the very near future, on the good will of Argentine foreign policy and, in the long term, of some type of agreement with our country that will surpass the not always guaranteed annual renewals of agreements signed so far. Aguilera's comment about Heathcoat Amory is opportune. He is the second consecutive British minister of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs to publicly recommend that the islanders seek more significant agreements with our country. It is also true that the profits obtained from fishing will generate deep-rooted changes in Falklands society, which sooner or later will understand that their best alternative to exploit this and other natural resources, and to enter the next century with a flourishing economy, unavoidably entails basic agreements with the only neighbor God gave them on Earth.", "qid": 351, "docid": "FBIS3-50743", "score": 11.609600067138672}, {"content": "Title: Content: July 31, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition OLD NUCLEAR DUMP OFF COAST IS A RELIC OF ERA OF NAIVETE IN TOXIC DISPOSAL In the black depths of the ocean near the Channel Islands lies a largely forgotten memento of the early nuclear age. It is low-level radioactive waste generated at Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory and Canoga Park plants. For about a decade starting in the early 1950s, Atomics International, later part of Rockwell, dumped hundreds of drums of radioactive waste in 6,000 feet of water south of Santa Cruz Island. Today, precise information on the dump is hard to come by. Old U.S. government reports estimate that the dump received about 3,100 drums of waste containing 108 curies of radioactivity -- apparently not a great concentration considering the diluting power of the sea. But it is not known if these numbers are accurate, or if all the dumping was recorded. Neither is it certain whether other government contractors disposed of waste at the site. Except for a limited survey in 1960, there has been no environmental monitoring of the Santa Cruz site by Rockwell or government agencies. No Specific Studies \"As far as we know, there have been no specific studies directed at that particular site to find out exactly what has been dumped there,\" said Diane Green, a park naturalist with Channel Islands National Park. \"The Park Service . . . does have concerns for that site as well as any other toxic dumping site,\" she said. Larger radioactive dumps used during the same years have been studied, specifically those near the Farallon Islands off San Francisco and in the Atlantic Ocean. Although elevated radioactivity was found in bottom sediment near these dumps, no significant levels were found in samples of fish. Most researchers have concluded that too little radioactive material was dumped off the U.S. coasts during the '40s, '50s and '60s to create a human health hazard. The dumping was more of a dangerous precedent than a life-threatening event, said W. Jackson Davis, professor of biology at UC Santa Cruz and a leading critic of ocean disposal. Other Waste However, the dump may also be a special case because radioactive waste was not the only thing disposed of near Santa Cruz, the largest island in Channel Islands National Park. When Atomics International began the dumping, the Navy was already using the site to dispose of military waste. In fact, official nautical charts describe the site as a former \"chemical munitions dumping area\" -- saying nothing about radioactive waste. The radioactive waste dumping, authorized by the old U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, was variously estimated by Rockwell officials to have stopped between 1959 and 1962, when commercial land burial sites became available for low-level wastes generated at the Canoga Park plants and the Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. \"The ocean is awfully big,\" and ocean dumping was considered \"a perfectly acceptable way to dispose of radioactive waste,\" said Marlin Remley, former chief of nuclear safety and licensing at Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, successor to Atomics International. \"I don't know when it was decided that, 'Hey, this is no good.' \" Atomics International dumped low-level material, including liquids, contaminated wipes, gloves, glassware and other equipment. But the refuse included some highly dangerous plutonium, according to a paper delivered by company officials at an AEC symposium in 1955. Atomics International began the ocean dumping before moving to its plant at 6633 Canoga Ave. at the end of 1955. Previously it disposed of waste from experiments at its plant in Downey, where the firm operated California's first nuclear power reactor, a tiny test model, starting in 1952. Although radioactive dumping by the United States virtually ended in 1962, it surfaced as a major environmental issue years later, leading to congressional hearings in 1976 and later. According to information compiled at the time, at least 27 Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf Coast sites were designated for low-level wastes, but the waste dumped near the Farallons and at three Atlantic Coast sites far exceeded the volume at all other sites combined. Virtually all environmental monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations has been done at these larger sites. Studies have found measurable radioactivity at each of the sites, but \"we didn't find any significant uptake of radioactive materials in any of the fish we sampled,\" said Bob Dyer, chief of environmental studies for the EPA office of radiation programs in Washington. Food Chain Similar conclusions have been reached by contract researchers for the California Department of Health Services, who have gathered fish samples near the Farallon Islands during the last few years. \"That's the key thing you want to know,\" Dyer said. \"You want to know whether it's going up the food chain and getting into man, and there's no evidence of that.\" Dyer said that in 1960, an AEC contract research firm did a limited survey of the Santa Cruz dump and found no significant contamination. According to the paper delivered by Atomics International at the AEC symposium, wastes were put in cylindrical ice cream cartons, which were placed in 55-gallon drums and sealed with concrete to make sure that they would sink to the bottom. About four times a year, the waste drums would be trucked to Long Beach for loading on a Navy barge. The price could not be beat. \"No costs are involved since the dumping ground trip by the U.S. Navy is regularly scheduled for other purposes and ample space is available\" on the Navy barge, the paper said. Paid Overtime But Atomics International paid overtime to its maintenance workers, several of whom accompanied each voyage. They would ride in the tug until it arrived at the dump, then take a small boat back to the barge to roll the drums over the side. The trip to the dump and back could take more than 24 hours, and the men were paid for every hour at sea. James Youngblood of Santa Clarita, a retired Rockwell worker who went on two of the dumping trips, said this was a plum assignment and the men took turns because of the extra pay. \"I think they enticed the maintenance workers, the blue-collar workers, with the overtime pay,\" said Eula Youngblood, his wife. \"We just took it for granted it was a safe thing to do,\" said Junius Wheeler of Lake View Terrace, a former maintenance supervisor who helped prepare the drums for disposal. The volumes dumped may have increased after nuclear work shifted from Downey to Canoga Park sites and the Santa Susana lab, which have done extensive work with test reactors and nuclear fuel. Firm's Records Company memos, provided by Rockwell in response to questions about the ocean disposal, allude to at least 10 dumping trips in 1958-59, including the disposal in September, 1958, of 225 55-gallon drums along with contaminated boxes, tanks and conduits. Sometimes the company hired commercial haulers, but a problem arose with the private firms. Just as the operation involved old ideas of pollution control, so did it run afoul of throwback racial attitudes. During the overnight trips, private tug crews were reluctant to share their bunks with the Atomics International maintenance men, some of whom were black, according to George Borg, a former health physicist with the company. Borg said a tugboat captain told him, \"The guys on board don't want to give up their bunks to anybody who's colored.\" As a result, he said, Atomics International resumed trips with the Navy. Another bad experience involved a private contractor hired to dispose of contaminated dirt around Santa Susana's experimental sodium reactor following a 1959 accident that melted part of its nuclear fuel, Borg said. The contractor, Coastwise Marine Disposal Co. of Long Beach, accumulated more than 1,000 drums of radioactive waste from various generators without dumping it. Eventually the firm, which was cited by the AEC for excessive radioactivity at its Long Beach plant, dumped the wastes, including those from Atomics International, at another Pacific dump site about 215 miles west of San Diego. Burbank Firm This second dump site was used by another San Fernando Valley firm, Isotopes Specialties Co. of Burbank, in 1961, according to a report by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, successor to the AEC. The lack of follow-up monitoring of the Santa Cruz dump is not necessarily a problem, said Don Womeldorf, chief of environmental management for the state Department of Health Services. \"I suppose the logical answer is that if we look in the areas where the greatest amount of dumping took place and find nothing of potential public health significance there, then one would conclude that the likelihood is much less of having problems where less material was deposited,\" Womeldorf said. Although Dyer also said he is not concerned about the Santa Cruz dump, he added: \"If it hasn't been monitored since 1960, it would probably be useful to assure ourselves that there's no significant inventory of radioactive materials present in the site. . . . If the public wanted assurances, then it would be a good idea.\"", "qid": 351, "docid": "LA073189-0071", "score": 11.586199760437012}, {"content": "Title: Content: 920721 FT 21 JUL 92 / Shetlanders worry about keeping their prosperity afloat: James Buxton is warned that the thriving economy of a remote group of islands 'could fall on its face very quickly' MR Bill Fraser identifies a problem, most unusual in Britain today, that confronts the Shetland Islands. He describes it as 'our very low rate of unemployment'. Unemployment in Shetland has been static at roughly 4 per cent for several years. In effect, the islands have virtually full employment. For Mr Fraser, who runs Shetland Enterprise, the local development agency, that means 'it can be difficult to convince people that in a few years' time their jobs could be gone'. If the 22,000 Shetlanders, who inhabit the northernmost point of the UK, do not sound particularly worried, that is understandable. Each day almost 1m barrels of oil pass through the Sullom Voe oil terminal from the Brent and Ninian fields in the North Sea. Shetland benefits from the 520 jobs at the British Petroleum terminal and from hundreds of other oil-related jobs as well as through disturbance payments and harbour dues from tankers. Islanders also benefit from rent and rates paid to Shetland Islands Council, which enable it to spend heavily on welfare projects and on helping local businesses through grants. Shetland exudes quiet prosperity, but its population has not sunk into the idleness of a rentier oil state in spite of the modest cushion of accumulated funds in the council's Charitable Trust, which amounts to about Pounds 135m, and the reserve fund for commercial projects of more than Pounds 30m. Shetland still makes much of its living from fish. Almost a third of the region's 10,000-strong labour force works in the fish industry, including fishermen, fish processors and salmon farmers. 'We are more dependent on fish than any other part of the EC,' says Mr John Goodlad, secretary of the Shetland Fishermen's Association. 'Without fishing, the future of this community is doubtful.' That Shetland is a hive of activity unrelated to oil is obvious to any visitor: the splendid harbour at Lerwick, the capital, is alive with powerful-looking fishing boats, ferries and the odd Russian cruise ship. Elsewhere crofts, making a living from the unpromising grazing, dot the landscape. Some of the islands' historic speciality of making knitwear continues and at least one company, Judane, exports garments to Japan that are produced on computer-controlled knitting machines. Yet, according to Mr Fraser, 'Shetland is a vigorous economy that could fall on its face very quickly.' The Sullom Voe terminal is in decline. Opened in 1981 and laid out to enable expansion to deal with throughput of 3m b/d, it reached its all-time one-day peak of 1.5m b/d in 1985. Parts of it have already been dismantled, while one of the four tanker loading berths has been mothballed. Mr Rod Walker, British Petroleum's terminal manager, says that Shell and Chevron, operators of the fields feeding the terminal, are committed to using it until 2000, but warns that throughput may by then have fallen to 300,000 b/d - the level at which it becomes uneconomic. If throughput of gas declined seriously, Sullom Voe would not be able to run its power station from gas and would have to import electricity. It might have to stop separating the gas from oil, which is part of its raison d'etre. 'We've got to find more oil out there, and compete for the oil that is found with other methods of transporting it,' says Mr Walker. The Clair field, about 50 miles west of Shetland, is now being explored and might use Sullom Voe, but it may not be until 2000 that development begins, and that may be too late for Sullom Voe. At the council, Mr Malcolm Green, the chief executive, says the local authority expects the 'final days of the terminal' - and thus of the council's oil income - will come between 2005 and 2010. Aware that money will become tighter, the council is reorganising itself and replacing grants for businesses with a system of loans. The fishing industry also presents an uncertain picture. In the white-fish industry, fishermen are frustrated at regulations requiring 135 days of tie-up a year to conserve stocks. The near-surface fishery - fishing for herring and mackerel - once depended largely on selling its catch to 50 or more factory ships from the former eastern bloc, the so-called Klondykers which came every summer to process herring in Lerwick harbour. Fewer Klondykers are expected this year, and Mr Goodlad believes that in two or three years this type of factory ship will have become uneconomic in the market economies of eastern Europe. Meanwhile, the remaining Klondykers depress the market for the Shetland fish-processing plants, as they now sell their output on the open market instead of disposing of it behind the Iron Curtain. The salmon farmers are cutting production because the market has been depressed by Norwegian overproduction, although Mr James Moncrieff of the Shetland Salmon Farmers Association believes prices will improve in the next few months as excess supply ends. Mr Goodlad is optimistic. 'The Shetland fish industry is at the leading edge of technology,' he says, and points to the gleaming new North Atlantic Fisheries College at Scalloway. It is a striking example of how Shetland invests its oil money: it cost Pounds 6m, most of it from the council, and has the latest equipment to teach nautical studies, marine engineering, aquaculture and fish processing. It is part of Shetland's preparations for the future. 'Our businesses have to be very efficient to compete with anyone given the high cost of transport to the mainland,' says Mr Jack Burgess, the council's development director. 'The council does help them, but there's no rush of companies coming to take advantage of what we offer here.' 'The Shetlanders are very adaptable people,' says Mr Fraser of Shetland Enterprise. 'But we're saying to them: You should start thinking about what you're going to do when the oil runs out.'", "qid": 351, "docid": "FT923-12066", "score": 11.579899787902832}, {"content": "Title: Content: November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition FLORIDA KEYS' ISLAMORADA: SEA TROVE OF ACTIVITY You're on top of a serene blue world on the high white bridge just south of Lower Matecumbe Island in the Florida Keys. Depending on which way you turn, the waters gleam azure or sapphire: Toward mainland Florida the warm, shallow bay is an opalescent aquamarine; across the deep Atlantic your eyes skim electric shades of blue as far as the Gulf Stream, a river of indigo pushing north at seven knots. This unbound, living sea is the main reason to visit the Keys. Here, the sun rises out of the Atlantic and sinks into Florida Bay, and you can witness both events the same day simply by crossing the Overseas Highway. Many travelers think of the Keys only as anchors for Highway 1's 115 miles and 42 bridges from the mainland to Key West. But there are hundreds of keys in Florida Bay, and the long chain connected by the road is divided into the Upper, Middle and Lower Keys, all with their own attractions. Green mile markers along the highway (often used as addresses) start at zero in Key West and end at 126 just below Florida City on the mainland. The Islamorada group of islands in the Upper Keys, beginning at Plantation Key (Mile Marker 90) and stretching south to Long Key (MM 68), calls itself the \"sport fishing capital of the world.\" The town of Islamorada on Upper Matecumbe Key has the largest concentration of charter fishing boats in the entire chain of islands, with several large marinas furnishing charter trips or rental boats so you can fish for tuna, amberjack or blue marlin, or sail into Florida Bay, part of Everglades National Park, to watch for endangered crocodiles, manatees and roseate spoonbills. Fishing reports are always available if you can scan your way through the ubiquitous Cuban salsa on the car radio to chatty WCTH, 100.3 FM. This local station also tells you where the local captains are and who has chartered them. But fishing is only one reason to stop over on this 20-mile stretch of the Keys. Many nearby attractions, including the continental United States' only living coral reef, superior hotels and the best restaurants outside of Key West, make Islamorada an attractive final destination in Florida. Pronounced EYE-la-mor-AH-da, this island group was named \"Purple Isles\" for the wild morning glories covering Upper Matecumbe Island, according to \"Conch\" (native) historian John Ovitt. \"One story goes that the Spanish named the islands for violet snail shells on the beaches,\" he said, \"but the area wasn't known as Islamorada until early in this century when the wife of an engineer constructing Flagler's Overseas Railroad admired the flowers.\" Although the Keys are no longer the pristine paradise that greeted 16th-Century Spanish explorers, or the sparsely populated islands that Henry Flagler and his railroaders encountered in 1905, the Islamorada area has many relatively unspoiled sites. Newest of the area's four state parks is the San Pedro Underwater Archeological Preserve, opened last year a mile south of Indian Key. Ovitt and others, working with the Florida Department of Natural Resources, have enhanced the site where the 287-ton, Dutch-built galleon San Pedro sank. They replaced the anchor, which had been removed years ago, and added cannon replicas cast from artillery on her sister ship San Jose, also sunk in the area. \"Twenty-one ships loaded with treasure left Havana on Friday the 13th in 1733,\" Ovitt says, \"and only one survived a great hurricane. Eleven wrecks lie in our waters, but the San Pedro is the most interesting. The site is 18 feet deep and easy for snorkelers and divers to explore.\" Ovitt also says that night diving, here and at natural reefs, is becoming popular. \"Many corals blossom at night and you can watch sleepy parrot fish.\" Ten-acre, uninhabited Indian Key, a mile off Lower Matecumbe, is rich in above-ground archeological sites such as circular cisterns and foundations. This tiny island is indebted for its colorful past to Capt. Jacob Housman, a famous \"wrecker\" who set up headquarters here in the 1830s. In deep water only four miles from Alligator Reef, Indian Key provided an ideal location for Housman to watch for the hundreds of ships being wrecked. Business was a resounding success, and he built Florida's first resort, the Tropical Hotel, with a bowling alley and billiard room. Indian Key became a busy port and the seat for Dade County in 1840. (The seat is now Miami.) The island attracted John James Audubon, who visited in 1832 and recorded birds he had never seen before, and Dr. Henry Perrine, a botanist who cultivated agave, tea, coffee and bananas. But when the Second Seminole War broke out in 1835, Chief Chekika heard Housman was negotiating with the government for a contract to kill Indians at $200 a head. The chief and a hundred warriors attacked the island in 1840, killing Perrine and forcing Housman to flee. On April 13 and 14, 1991, the 13th annual Indian Key Festival will re-enact the 1840 attack with authentic costume, weapons, encampments and tours of the island. The defunct post office is even reactivated to issue first-day covers. The Park Service also offers a trip to Lignumvitae Key State Botanical Site, just opposite Indian Key on the bay side of Lower Matecumbe. This 280-acre island is a rare example of a virgin sub-tropical hardwood forest, once common in the Upper Keys. The 1919 coral-rock Matheson House, too, is unchanged. Thursday through Monday there are two-hour tours, in 24-passenger boats, of Indian Key and Lignumvitae Key. You must have reservations, and fees are $6 for adults and $3 for children under 12. For nature walks, visit Long Key State Recreational Area at MM 67.5 and see wading birds in the mangrove-lined lagoons and a vista of the tropical hardwood forest from an observation tower. One nature trail is called the Golden Orb, after the red and gold spider that weaves a huge web. There are ranger-led programs, picnicking and camping. Everyone tells you there's a beach at Long Key, but it's a very narrow strip of sand lined with Australian pines. For information on parks, tours and festivals, contact the Park Manager, c/o Long Key State Recreation Area, P.O. Box 776, Long Key, Fa. 33001, (305) 664-4815. One of the Keys' tourist leaflets states, \"The beaches here are distinctive.\" Yes, they are. Where they exist at all in the Upper Keys they are slim and rocky, with limestone sand laced with sharp coral. But you can't have everything, and the Keys' lack of beaches has surely cut down on exploitation. At MM 102.5 on Key Largo, not strictly in the Islamorada area but an easy drive, is the Keys' most popular attraction, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. Park boats can take you diving or snorkeling, and the glass-bottomed \"Discovery\" makes the fairyland reef accessible to everyone. The nation's first underwater state park is very crowded on weekends. Back in Islamorada at Theater of the Sea (MM 84), the world's second oldest marine park, you can sail in a \"bottomless\" boat with a perimeter for passengers and a center for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins to jump into. The dolphin lagoon is an old excavation of the Overseas Railroad, which was pushed through to Key West in 1912 and destroyed by a hurricane in 1935 that also took 423 lives. Theater of the Sea is big on audience participation, and small enough to make the fun feel personal. Children can perform with the seals and ride a boat towed by dolphins. Good swimmers 13 and up can swim with a dolphin for 30 minutes for $65. Colorful jobs abound here. Four times a day employees step into a pool of nurse sharks, picking one up for visitors to \"pet.\" In another pool, Mark Giro feeds giant stingrays as dozens of pelicans waddle noisily on shelter roofs and hover overhead, hoping for a free bite. \"The most dangerous animals here are these pelicans,\" he says, as a big brown specimen divebombs him for a mouthful of fish intended for a turtle. The Islamorada Chamber of Commerce lists 41 hotels, motels, resorts and condominiums in the area. Nightly winter rates range from the Cheeca Lodge listed at $195 to $325 to the Key Lantern Motel at $37-$50. Apart from Key West, the Islamorada area has more good restaurants than any other area in the Keys. You'll find three things on every menu: conch fritters, key lime pie and dolphin. (Dolphin served as \"catch of the day\" is no relation to the porpoise you swam with. It's simply mahi-mahi.) A mermaid beckons you into Lorelei, MM82, where fishing guides, including those specializing in the back country, hang out. Lorelei is open from 7 a.m. until it closes. You can sit outside and be eyed by an egret studying your $5.25 Key Largo fish sandwich. The key lime pie served here with gobs of whipped cream is very good. After waiting for a table and glancing at the menu at popular Ziggie's Conch, MM83, you wonder what all the fuss is about. The uninspired bill of fare is straight out of the '50s, offering fried shrimp, fish du jour and advising \"all entrees served with chopped lettuce salad.\" But then Ziggie stops by your table mumbling a long verbal menu, with specials like yellowtail served \"rangoon\" or delectable softshell crab, and on and on. Entrees run about $17, and the children's menu starts at $5.25 for a hamburger. Don't miss the conch fritter appetizer with a dip of soy, honey, mustard and a mystery ingredient. Ziggie says, \"I was married once and I learned not to tell everything.\" He knows how to charge for a small slice of key lime pie at $3. Manny & Isa's Kitchen, MM 81.6, may try your patience with its noisy, cramped dining room, but the Cuban specialties are worth it. For $6.75 you can have picadillo, a pork chop or palomilla steak with rice, black beans, salad and bread. Fish of the day goes for $12.95, or if you want to eat cheap for a week, invest $15 in a gallon of black bean soup to take back to your motel. Great key lime pie is a bargain at $1.95. The Green Turtle Inn, MM 81.3, one of the Keys' most famous and popular restaurants, has been in business since 1947 with walls covered by old newspapers and photos. But it's dark and too smoky, with a menu on the ordinary side. Full-course dinners featuring dolphin \"a la Roxie\" or alligator steak start at $14.50. Children can eat for $2.50, and key lime pie is $2.75. Marker 88, on Plantation Key, is reputed to be the best restaurant in the Keys. The menu is ambitious and extensive (ditto the wine list), with dishes like rice colonial Bombay and fish Algerian. As a change from fish, chef Andre Mueller includes a variety of steak and veal dishes from $16 and up, and a children's menu starts with spaghetti at $2.95 with fish, shrimp and scallops going for $8.45. The interior is slightly on the dreary side, but the food is very good. If you're on a budget or have to feed a group, consider the huge Coral Grill, MM 83.5, for a casual buffet with quantities of roast beef and steamed shrimp. The Atlantic's Edge Restaurant at the Cheeca Lodge serves a fine dinner in an elegant room with an ocean view. Families are welcomed, with reduced portions of many items half-price for children 12 and under, and the \"fish you caught today\" can be prepared for $14 per person. Conch fritters are great, if not cheap, served in a spicy tomato-basil sauce for $6. Fresh vegetables and herbs abound in dishes like broiled grouper with garlic and black bean sauce for $18, or steamed dolphin with tomatoes, fresh herbs and balsamic vinegar for $16.75. Lamb chops with fried zucchini spaghetti will run you $27, and out-pricing even Ziggie's, key lime pie is $4. For the Islamorada Visitors Guide, contact the Chamber of Commerce, P.O.

There is no getting around it - Peter Skog, chief officer and keeper of the Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the 1990s? Or is there simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another, Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic. Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded, ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No 38 bus on to the Edgware Road. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me. One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just do the trick. Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log two days ago as we crossed the notorious Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the Antarctic Peninsula. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my cabin bathroom. Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise Drake, Magellan and Darwin, all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise Alex, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without spilling a drop. But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that Alex is one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, Alex stands somewhere near the top. Sea temperature -0.50 Skog has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I, who knew the secret of volcanic Pendulum Cove and its sand beach, geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing? Skog might not be impressed, but I was. Pendulum Cove gave me a better bath than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in London. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes Skog, as if compiling a shopping list for Sainsbury's supermarket. But I can tell you that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying pesto sauce or coffee beans. In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards. Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French waiters, but are far more approachable. Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200 yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative, testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in my favourite local on a busy Saturday night. But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for the whales. Skog can
